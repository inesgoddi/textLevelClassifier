Euthanasia Coaster,"The Euthanasia Coaster is an art concept. The idea was a steel roller coaster designed to kill its passengers. 
In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas. Urbonas used to work in an amusement park. Urbonas said that the goal of his proposed roller coaster is to take lives ""with elegance and euphoria"". Urbonas said it would be like ""euthanasia"" or ""execution"". 
John Allen, who was the president of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, gave Urbonas the idea. Allen wanted an ""ultimate"" roller coaster that ""sends out 24 people and they all come back dead"". Urbonas took Allen's idea and designed the roller coaster. Urbonas said the roller coaster would make its passengers unconscious before killing them. It was criticized by the anti-euthanasia association Care Not Killing.
The roller coaster kills its passengers by drastically decreasing oxygen in their brains.

Omnipotence paradox,"The omnipotence paradox is a family of paradoxes that arise with some understandings of the term omnipotent. The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even a logically contradictory one such as creating a square circle. Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for countering theism. Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether omnipotence is directed toward God Himself or outward toward his external surroundings.
The omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 10th century, when the Saadia Gaon responded to the question of whether God's omnipotence extended to logical absurdities. It was later addressed by Averroes and Thomas Aquinas. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to ""deny Himself"".
The best-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the paradox of the stone: ""Could God create a stone so heavy that even he could not lift it?"" This is a paradoxical question because if God could create something he could not lift, then he would not be omnipotent. Similarly, if God was able to lift the stone then that would mean he was unable to create something he could not lift, leading to the same result. Alternative statements of the paradox include ""If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?"" and ""Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?"".


== Overview ==
A common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: ""Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?"" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being can create a stone that it cannot lift, then it is not omnipotent because there is a weight threshold beyond its own power to lift. If the being cannot create a stone it cannot lift, then there is something it cannot create, and is therefore not omnipotent. In either case, the being is not omnipotent.
A related issue is whether the concept of ""logically possible"" is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.
The dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox—the irresistible force paradox: ""What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?"" One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Another response to this that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. However this does not hold up under scrutiny, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.


== Types of omnipotence ==

Augustine of Hippo in his City of God writes ""God is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills"" and thus proposes the definition that ""Y is omnipotent"" means ""If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X"". 
The notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An essentially omnipotent being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an accidentally omnipotent being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.
In addition, some philosophers have considered the assumption that a being is either omnipotent or non-omnipotent to be a false dilemma, as it neglects the possibility of varying degrees of omnipotence. Some modern approaches to the problem have involved semantic debates over whether language—and therefore philosophy—can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.


== Proposed answers ==


=== Omnipotence does not mean breaking the laws of logic ===
A common response from philosophers is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything at all but, rather, that he can do anything that is logically possible; he cannot, for instance, make a square circle. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself, because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, says it is ""impossible for God to lie"".

A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes. Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a ""task"" is termed by him a ""pseudo-task"" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. Harry Frankfurt—following from Descartes—has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone.For why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task—the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift—whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposedly capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory—that of creating the problematic stone in the first place—why should He not be supposedly capable of performing another—that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?
If a being is accidentally omnipotent, it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power. On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.
If a being is essentially omnipotent, then it can also resolve the paradox. The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore it is impossible for it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible—just like the accidentally omnipotent—and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.

The omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself—thus, removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, it is possible for non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.
Thus, Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.
In a 1955 article in the philosophy journal Mind, J. L. Mackie tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have). An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.

God and logic
Although the most common translation of the noun ""Logos"" is ""Word"" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902–1985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as ""Logic"": ""In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God"". He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the law of non contradiction by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.This raises the question, similar to the Euthyphro Dilemma, of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to these theologians (Norman Geisler and William Lane Craig), this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his omniscience or omnibenevolence.


=== Paradox is meaningless: the question is sophistry ===
Another common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase ""could not lift"" does not make sense and the paradox is meaningless. This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence—contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it—is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, which it is not. An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)—or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings)  that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he could not lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that could lift the stone could not.
The lifting a rock paradox (Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?) uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from it:

Lifting covers up the definition of translation, which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, ""Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?"" For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.
The words, ""Lift a Stone"" are used instead to substitute capability. With this in mind, essentially the question is asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, ""Is God capable of being incapable?"" If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He has the potential to not be able to do something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.
The act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a lack of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.
C. S. Lewis argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing ""a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it"" is nonsense just as much as referencing ""a square circle""; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking ""Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?"" is just as much nonsense as asking ""Can God draw a square circle?"" The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement ""God can lift this rock"" must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that is too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this does not quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.
In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a limit on its actual agency, but an epistemological boundary without which omnipotence could not be identified (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, ""I am a liar"", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an epistemological paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, ""God can"" before it. Lewis additionally said that, ""Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved"". This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.
Paradox assumes the rock has already been created
In 1999, Matthew Whittle asserts that it should not be outside the scope of powers for an omnipotent being to make itself non-omnipotent, so indeed making a rock too heavy to lift is possible for God. The follow on question ""Then can he lift it?"" assumes that the rock has already been created, so the correct answer would be ""Assuming he makes the rock, no"". And if asked ""Is God thus not all powerful?"", the correct answer would be ""God is indeed all powerful until such time as the rock is created"". The ""Paradox"" then is not really a paradox.


== Language and omnipotence ==
The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, he stays generally within the realm of logical positivism until claim 6.4—but at 6.41 and following, he argues that ethics and several other issues are ""transcendental"" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God—arguing that, ""When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words"".
Wittgenstein's work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in semantics—the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort ""That's only semantics,"" is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the Tractatus, then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the Tractatus gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: ""What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence"".
Wittgenstein's approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as D. Z. Phillips. In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the Tractatus, and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.


== Other versions of the paradox ==
In the 6th century, Pseudo-Dionysius claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in Acts 13:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether God can ""deny himself"" a'la 2 Tim 2:13. In the 11th century, Anselm of Canterbury argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.
Thomas Aquinas advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in Summa contra Gentiles:

Since the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.
This can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of non-Euclidean geometry does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, ""If given the axioms of Riemannian geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to more than 180 degrees?"" In either case, the real question is whether an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.
A version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or parliamentary sovereignty, which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.
In a sense, the classic statement of the omnipotence paradox—a rock so heavy that its omnipotent creator cannot lift it—is grounded in Aristotelian science. After all, if we consider the stone's position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is constantly lifted—strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: ""An omnipotent being creates a universe that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics. Within this universe, can the omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it?""
Ethan Allen's Reason addresses the topics of original sin, theodicy and several others in classic Age of Enlightenment fashion. In Chapter 3, section IV, he notes that ""omnipotence itself"" could not exempt animal life from mortality, since change and death are defining attributes of such life. He argues, ""the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without valleys, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature"". Labeled by his friends a Deist, Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout Reason he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.
In Principles of Philosophy, Descartes tried refuting the existence of atoms with a variation of this argument, claiming God could not create things so indivisible that he could not divide them.

Tour operator,"A tour operator is a business that typically combines and organizes accommodations, meals, sightseeing and transportation components, in order to create a package tour. They advertise and produce brochures to promote their products, holidays and itineraries. Tour operators can sell directly to the public or sell through travel agents or a combination of both.
The most common example of a tour operator's product would be a flight on a charter airline, plus a transfer from the airport to a hotel and the services of a local representative, all for one price. Each tour operator may specialise in certain destinations, e.g. Italy, activities and experiences, e.g. skiing, or a combination thereof.


== Operations ==
The original raison d'être of tour operating was the difficulty for ordinary folk of making arrangements in far-flung places, with problems of language, currency and communication. The advent of the Internet has led to a rapid increase in self-packaging of holidays. However, tour operators still have their competence in arranging tours for those who do not have time to do DIY holidays, and specialize in large group events and meetings such as conferences or seminars. Also, tour operators still exercise contracting power with suppliers (airlines, hotels, other land arrangements, cruise companies and so on) and influence over other entities (tourism boards and other government authorities) in order to create packages and special group departures for destinations that might otherwise be difficult and expensive to visit.


== Trade associations ==
The three major tour operator associations in the U.S. are the National Tour Association (NTA), the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA), and the American Bus Association (ABA). In Europe, there are the European Tour Operators Association (ETOA), and in the UK, the ABTA – The Travel Association and the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO).  The primary association for receptive North American inbound tour operators is the International Inbound Travel Association.

Weather,"Weather is the day-to-day or hour-to-hour change in the atmosphere. Weather includes wind, lightning, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes (also known as twisters), rain, hail, snow, and lots more. Energy from the Sun affects the weather too. 
Climate tells us what kinds of weather usually happen in an area at different times of the year. 
Changes in weather can affect the mood and life of many living things. People wear different clothes and do different things in different weather conditions. They also choose different foods in different seasons.   
Weather stations around the world measure different parts of weather. Ways to measure weather are wind speed, wind direction, temperature and humidity. People try to use these measurements to make weather forecasts for the future.  These people are  scientists that are called meteorologists. They use computers to build large mathematical models to follow weather trends.
Severe weather can hurt people and their property. It can also just be a bother. Some examples of severe weather are:

Tropical cyclones
Rainstorms
Drought
Heat waves
Tornadoes


== Causes of weather ==
Weather happens because different parts of the Earth get different amounts of heat from the Sun. This makes different climates. The tropics get the most heat because the Sun shines straight down on them, while the poles get the least heat because the Sun shines on them from a low angle. Warmer air is lighter than cooler air and rises higher in the sky by convection.
The air always has some water mixed with it. This is called humidity. When it cools, the water can change from a gas to a liquid through condensation. Then the water can fall from the sky as rain or snow. After the air rises, it gets colder and goes back towards the ground. Because the air lost its water before, it is dry when it comes back to the ground. When two air masses of different temperatures meet, this is called a warm front or cold front. The ways that the air moves around the Earth are called atmospheric circulation.

Diving tourism industry,"Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism.
Motivations to travel for scuba diving are complex and may vary considerably during the diver's development and experience. Participation can vary from once off to multiple dedicated trips per year over several decades. The popular destinations fall into several groups, including tropical reefs, shipwrecks and cave systems, each frequented by its own group of enthusiasts, with some overlap. Temperate and inland open water reef sites are generally dived by people who live relatively nearby.
The industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, safety and convenience by way of dive charter services and guide services on dives. Customer satisfaction is largely dependent on the quality of services provided, and personal communication has a strong influence on the popularity of specific service providers in a region.
Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers. Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs so that the industry can continue to develop sustainably.
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity, requiring significant capital outlay to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large capital expense, with high running costs. There are also health and safety aspects for the operator and the customer. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money. Economic sustainability is affected by environmental awareness and conservation, service delivery and customer satisfaction, and sustainable business management. Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, declarations of medical fitness to dive, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.


== History ==

The history of scuba diving tourism is linked to the history of scuba equipment development and availability, and to the development of training systems that opened up the activity to sufficient numbers to support the industry. Key equipment developments include swimfins, which give the diver underwater mobility and free the hands for other functions, the diving mask, which provides underwater vision, the open circuit regulator, a simple and reliable breathing gas source, the buoyancy compensator, which allows the diver to swim comfortably above the bottom, and float at the surface, wetsuit, a simple and easy to use protection from moderately cold water, submersible pressure gauge, allowing easy monitoring of remaining breathing gas, dive computers,  and nitrox breathing gas, both of which allowed longer dives without decompression.
The growth of the diving industry in a region tends to follow a logistic curve, with a slow start and mostly established, experienced divers with relatively high skill levels exploring a new area where there is little supporting infrastructure. As the area becomes popular, the infrastructure develops and the growth accelerates until it is limited by carrying capacity is approached. By this time the main diver demography has shifted towards the inexperienced and often uncertified diver, with low skill levels and a greater tendency to damage the environment  due to ignorance and lack of basic diving skills. Beyond this stage the situation may stabilise if managed well, or if not, the deterioration in value to the tourist may cause a reduction in popularity and a loss of trade.
Too much competition for customers amongst a large number of diving service providers in a region can lead to low profit margins and pressure on struggling companies to cut costs by following unsustainable diving practices and providing substandard equipment. A reduction in numbers may lead to more cooperation between the remaining companies, and a greater willingness to follow sustainable practices.
The shape of the curve will vary depending on the region.  Areas with more resilient ecologies may see larger numbers while remaining viable, while areas with sensitive ecologies may suffer early collapse. Climate change is likely to render many areas more sensitive to diver impact and most will probably have a reduction in carrying capacity based on limits of acceptable change. The sites that remain viable for longer may receive the overflow from sites which suffer ecological collapse, putting them under greater stress as the less competent divers flood areas that were previously less attractive to them.


== Motivation ==

The motivations of scuba divers to travel have been attributed to adventure, learning, escape, social interaction, stature, challenge and excitement, and while these are probably valid for most novice divers and some long term divers, the motivation of long term enthusiasts may be more complex. The development of a recreational diver from novice to experienced diver is usually associated with acquisition and improvement of skills, and is often accompanied by a shift in motivations to dive. Similarly, expectations of the diving experience, satisfaction with the experience available at different dive sites, and attitudes towards the underwater environment will change in divers who continue to dive over the longer term and relatively frequently. The desire to improve and learn for personal growth and the long term satisfaction and fulfilment derived from this learning is common in such divers. This could be an important factor informing the planning and management of diving tourism.


== Destinations ==

Three main classes of recreational diving tourism destinations exist. These are tropical reefs, shipwrecks, and cave systems. Each caters to a different clientele, though there is some overlap. Temperate reefs are less popular as tourist attractions, but can have their own enthusiasts, including short range tourism and incidental dive tourism associated with general tourism in the region. Any exceptional dive site may be visited by expeditionary dive tourists once the attractions are known, though these destinations are generally not serviced by mainstream tourism service providers.


=== Regions where recreational diving is a major tourist industry ===
There are a few regions where international diver tourism is a significant part of the economy They are mostly tropical areas with extensive coral reefs and predictable weather and water conditions, and often have relatively undeveloped industrial economies.

Great Barrier Reef of Australia
The Red Sea
Hurghada is one of the diving destinations on the Red Sea with rich marine biodiversity, good visibility, a variety of dive sites suitable for different skill levels, including historic shipwrecks, and is accessible at all times of the year.
The Caribbean Sea
Indonesia
Thailand
The Coral Triangle of southeast Asia:
The Philippines
Malaysia
Other regions are also popular for diving, but the relative importance of scuba tourism is lower. There are a very large number of dive sites in Europe, and also in parts of the US, reflecting the origins of the activity and a large fraction of the tourists.


=== Tropical coral reefs ===

Tropical coral reefs are popular recreational diving tourism destinations, as they are generally both pleasant and colorful to dive, relatively low in serious hazards, and the water is at a comfortable temperature, so they attract divers of all levels of competence. They are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact.
Regions include:


=== Shipwrecks ===

Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.
Wreck diving may be divided into three categories of differing hazard and skill and certification requirement:

Non-penetration diving (i.e. swimming over the wreck)
Limited penetration diving, within the ""light zone""
Full penetration diving, beyond the ""light zone""
The inherent hazards of wreck diving may be aggravated by local circumstances like depth, layout and condition of the wreck, the silting hazard, and general sea conditions such as visibility, illumination, surge and currents, and water temperature. Training for wreck diving may be marketed as an associated service.


=== Flooded cave systems ===

Cave diving is diving in water-filled caves, which is considered an extreme sport. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, but almost all cave diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave diving and cavern diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified. Cave diving is a specialist aspect of scuba tourism, as the risks are relatively high and the skill requirements are stringent. Cave diving tourism is generally serviced by specialist dive guides and instructors.
Regions include:

The cenotes of the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico.


== Dive resorts ==
A dive resort is a recreational diving service provider which also provides accommodation for clients and their families. They are usually established in places where recreational diving tourism is popular for a large part of the year, particularly if it is a significant part of the local economy.
Dive resorts usually start out small, catering for dive group of about ten divers booked by a single dive shop or agent from a remote area, so the group is often divers who are a social group at their place of origin. This allows the resort to accommodate the needs of that particular group. If the resort becomes popular, it will usually expand and may become the nucleus for development of the area as other service industries form around it.


== Services provided ==
The scuba diving tourism industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, dive charter services and guide services on dives. These organisations are called recreational diving service providers, or dive centres. The standard EN 14467 / ISO 24803 specifies performance requirements for the service provider, and covers aspects of diver training and education, guided dives, and equipment rental, but not the supply of breathing gases, as this is usually covered by national legislation. All of these services are considered distinct.


=== Experiences ===
Retail dive centres provide dive charters, which may be shore or boat dived, dive guides and information on the local environment and ecology, and transportation to and from the dive sites, and may also provide accommodation and hospitality services to tourists, or act as their agents for these services.


==== Liveaboards and day boat dives ====

A liveaboard dive boat is a mobile dive resort. The divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat and provide catering and other hotel services. Amenities may vary from basic to luxurious and the cost will be in proportion. In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber.
The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical diver lift platform. Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat.The tender may also be used to fetch divers separated from the main boat, and for shore excursions where there are no docking facilities.
day boat and basic boat dives may be provided through a land based dive resort, a dive shop, or booked directly with the boar operator. Facilities range from catered with multiple dives to basic transport to and from the site. Much depends on the distance to the site and expected sea and weather conditions.
A day boat would generally provide shelter from the weather and spray while in transit, and be used to transport divers to more than one dive-site during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them. Smaller boats are more usually used when the distance to the dive site is short, and only one dive is intended. Facilities are likely to provide sitting space and a place to sore the scuba set and basic gear. It is common for the diver to travel wearing the diving suit. Since the boat needs only a small amount of space for each diver, it can be smaller and faster than larger boats, or be optimised for surf or slipway launches where there are no convenient harbours. Protection from the weather on fast boats is likely to be the diving suit, sometimes with a windbreaker worn over it, and a hat for the sun, but this will depend on weather conditions.


=== Safety ===

Historically, scuba diving was considered a relatively high risk activity, but this perception has been modified by the developments in equipment, training and service provision. Medical support services and local availability of decompression chambers and on-board medical oxygen for first aid has increased, improving the management of diving accidents and reducing the risk of permanent injury. Recompression facilities for treating serious diving injuries are not often available, even in first world countries.
Prudent service providers will check a client's certification cards and log to ensure the diver has been assessed as competent to dive sites similar to those booked, and may require the diver to demonstrate relevant skills in a checkout dive. Where skills are not of a standard required for safe diving, or environmentally responsible diving, the diver may be requested to take part in remedial training.


=== Equipment ===

The dive tourism industry tends to provide rental equipment to travelling divers more than equipment sales and service, but those aspects are considered valuable adjuncts. Scuba equipment is relatively heavy, and some components (scuba cylinders and diving weights) are not economically transportable by air, and may be included in the cost of a dive. Regulators, wet-suits, masks and fins are more personal equipment, and may be brought by the diver or rented, so a fairly large stock and where applicable, range of sizes is necessary to be able to rent equipment to all customers at a given time. Cameras and dive computers are usually owned by the diver, though entry-level examples may be available for hire at some dive centres. Some equipment manufacturers and distributors encourage exclusive provision of their products through financial incentives, and the range of spares and tools for servicing is affected by the range of equipment stocked, so the range of equipment available may be limited.


=== Diver training ===

There is a large market for diver training while on vacation. Most parts of the world do not have desirable local recreational dive sites, and many divers choose to combine training with a vacation to an area of popular dive sites. Sites suitable for entry-level training often differ considerably from sites which feature as highly desirable for scenic dives and high biodiversity, and unskilled beginners are necessarily kept away from deeper sites with more challenging conditions for their own safety and the protection of the often fragile ecosystems. Specialist wreck diving, cave diving and low environmental impact diving courses are usually available where the local sites are associated with requirements for these certifications.
The Universal Referral Program (URP) is a system intended to facilitate completion of training for open water recreational scuba diving students who intend to do their training dives at a place different from the venue for the theory and confined water training. More specifically, it allows inter agency referral - the referral instructor is not necessarily a member of the same certification agency as the initiating instructor.
Refresher training


=== Specialisation training ===
Training in several specialisations, particularly in technical diving, has become popular as tourism adjuncts because of the venue requiring a specific skill set for access to the sites.

Cave diving
Sidemount diving
Rebreather diving
Deep wreck and wreck penetration diving
Other specialisation training is more optional, as the specific certification is not strictly required, such as boat diving, night diving or drift diving, which are specialties with certification in some agencies' training options, but considered an integral part of core skill certification by others.


== Environmental impact ==

During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Since the 1970s diving has changed from an elite activity to a more accessible recreation, marketed to a very wide demographic. To some extent better equipment has been substituted for more rigorous training, and the reduction in perceived risk has shortened minimum training requirements by several training agencies. Training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences.
Scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide, which has increased to about 23 million by 2016 at about one million per year. Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers.
Diver impact on subtropical, and particularly temperate reefs is less researched than tropical reefs. The perception is that these reefs are less vulnerable than tropical reefs and the sessile species are less vulnerable to diver impact. Diver contact with the bottom is also prevalent on temperate reefs – one of the main forms mentioned is fin contact with the bottom sediment, raising particulate material into the water column and degrading visibility.
Three aspects of responsible diving behaviour have been identified:

Safe diving behaviour, which is largely a matter of competence, use of appropriate equipment for the dive, use of equipment in good working order, staying within the bounds of personal competence and adherence to procedures known to reduce risk.
Good buoyancy control and trim, the ability to remain at a controlled distance from the benthos, and to do so without contacting it. This is a skill often neglected in entry level recreational diver training, but often offered as an extra course, (eg: PADI Peak performance buoyancy), in training systems that have been planned around minimising the duration of individual courses, and where the entry-level training concentrates on providing the minimum skills acceptable for the safety of the diver in the conditions where the training is done. This has convenience advantages to the diver, and financial advantages to the training provider, but as most recreational divers never progress in training beyond entry level, they are often left marginally competent, and may not get enough practice to improve.
Non-contact behaviour, the voluntary avoidance of contact which may damage the environment. This behaviour is only effective if good buoyancy control and trim are available, and it requires situational awareness which may not be sufficiently developed in a novice, particularly in an unfamiliar environment, and using unfamiliar equipment, often exacerbated by the use of a camera, which can distract the diver from detail awareness of their surroundings.
The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types:

The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites,
Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, causing direct physical damage
Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage, which can dislodge loose deposits and accelerate corrosion
Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.


=== Strategies for sustainable use management ===

Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs

Carrying capacity approach. where the number of divers is restricted. This also limits tourism income from the region. Sustainable diver carrying capacity is influenced by factors which vary between sites.
Limits of acceptable change. This model uses quantitative limits on change defined in specific management objectives for a site using an established baseline.
Percentile approach, where capacity is limited by comparison with damage at non-dived control sites
Restricting recreational divers to delimited locations, which usually concentrates divers and damage along diving trails. This creates paths of degraded reef through the more pristine areas, and will cause dissatisfaction as the trail degrades further.
Regulating the type of diving equipment allowed, generally accessories which are thought to increase reef contacts, such as gloves and cameras. These restrictions are understandably unpopular with photographers, and may be applied to both divers who manage to avoid contact and those who do not.
Changing the methods by which the industry provides services. Closer supervision and intervention by dive guides can reduce diver contact rates where the divers are sufficiently skilled to modify their behaviour during the dive. A pre-dive briefing on responsible behaviour, regulations and environmental values can reduce the rate of diver impacts where the divers are sufficiently competent to avoid contact. More effective interventions occur when the number of divers per guide is low.
Encouraging or enforcing competence of divers in low impact diving as a precondition for diving in sensitive areas. This has been identified as an effective way of reducing diver contact.


== Economics ==
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity. Significant capital outlay is required to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large to very large capital expense, and running costs and crew salaries can be considerable. There are also health and safety aspects to be considered, both for the operator and the customer, as high pressure filling equipment is used to provide breathing air which will be used in a hostile environment. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money, and annual registration fees are a required.


=== Sustainability ===
Three factors have been identified as important in economic sustainability:

Environmental awareness and conservation: The regions that are the most popular destinations for most recreational diver tourism are also those with the most fragile and vulnerable ecosystems. Divers have a tendency to choose their destinations based on reputation for a quality experience, which is largely related to the state of the ecosystem. Word gets around when a region's dive sites are deteriorating, and this adversely affects bookings and income. For sustainable business over the long term, the local service providers and communities need to ensure that the impact on the ecology is sustainable. To a large extent this involves ensuring that clients are competent to dive the local sites without damaging delicate organisms, which often requires a level of skill greater than the diver can sustain by diving only a few times a year.
Service delivery and customer satisfaction: Depending  on location, it may be difficult or impossible to consistently provide a satisfactory dive experience, as weather and sea conditions may not be predictable over the longer term. Consequently the type of diving tourism can vary considerably by region, with service providers in some places only able to confirm bookings a few days in advance, while in others a cancellation is the exception, and this may vary seasonally. Customer satisfaction is linked to expectations, and providers catering to a repeat market may be less likely to take the boat out on a day when conditions are forecast to be marginal by local standards.
Sustainable business management. (Return on investment, maintaining reputation, maintaining equipment, compliance with safety requirements etc)


=== Economic risks ===

International risks to the diving tourism industry include terrorism, economic recessions and global disease epidemics. Domestic risks within the borders of specific countries may include increased crime rates, and political instability.
Environmental degradation, partly due to the impact of recreational diving on the environment, where pollution and direct damage by divers have been recorded, and the effects of natural disasters and climate change such as increased water temperature causing coral bleaching are threatening the industry, as divers are less inclined to visit areas where these problems have been reported. Overexploitation by fishing and illegal extraction have led to some sites being closed and permit systems introduced, sometimes limiting the numbers of divers that may visit an area in a given time interval.
The global economic downturn has reduced spending on expensive leisure activities, reducing the income of tourism destinations, including scuba diving charters and diving schools, and political instability deters visitors to a region
Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.
A large proportion of divers visiting tropical coral reef destinations are international travellers – circumstances that may induce them not to travel, or not to visit a particular region can have a strong influence on the viability of a diving operation. A study on diving tourism in East Africa showed that the major environmental risks  for that region are overfishing and marine pollution. The economic risks are mainly price inflation and recessions, the social risks include global disease epidemics and international crime, and political instability and onerous visa regulations are the major political risks.


== Demographics ==

Recreational diving tourists appear to be male-dominated, with an average age in the mid thirties, a college education, and higher than average income, which is in keeping with the relatively high costs of equipment, training and travel.
The general population of American scuba diving participants are on average wealthier and better educated than the general population, and have a higher participation than average in individual and team sports, and extreme sports. Nearly 46% participate in running or jogging, and 36% swim for fitness. The DAN medical emergency line and fatality and injury monitoring program have reported that some divers get injured as a consequence of inadequate physical fitness.
A study to identify differences between local scuba divers and visitors in Florida showed that visitors had less certification and experience but spent more on scuba, compared to local resident divers. Cluster analysis identified four groups of scuba divers:

Fun-seeking belongers: Divers with a strong affiliation for group belonging, looking for fun and excitement, enjoyed diving in varied locations, enjoyed stimulating encounters and considered bonding with other divers important. They self-identified as belonging to the scuba community and sought to associate with other divers with similar attitudes. They tended to have more diving experience and spent more on scuba activities. Mostly males, and the majority unmarried.
Actualizers: Divers focused on challenge, self-recognition, and self-esteem values, likely to consider certification important and consider that overcoming the challenges is important to their self-image. Represented by more females than other groups, and lower income and expenditure on scuba activities.
Inner-circles: People who perceived diving as an opportunity to make new friends, and spend time with family and friends. Image as a diver relatively unimportant, and not driven to be part of the scuba diving community. Mostly married, male, well-educated, with less diving experience than average.
Moderates: Divers more likely to do a single dive in a day, and less focused on the characteristics typical of the other groups.


== Legal risk and liability ==
Participation in recreational diving implies acceptance of the inherent risks of the activity. Diver training includes training in procedures known to reduce these risks to a level considered acceptable by the certification agency, and issue of certification implies that the agency accepts that the instructor has assessed the diver to be sufficiently competent in these skills at the time of assessment and to be sufficiently informed to accept the asso",1
Torch,"A torch is a stick with combustible material at one end which can be used as a light source or to set something on fire. Torches have been used throughout history, and are still used in processions, symbolic and religious events, and in juggling entertainment. In some countries, notably the United Kingdom and Australia, ""torch"" in modern usage is also the term for a battery-operated portable light. 


== Etymology ==
From the Old French ""torche"" meaning ""twisted thing"", hence ""torch formed of twisted tow dipped in wax"", probably from Vulgar Latin *torca, alteration of Late Latin torqua, variant of classical Latin torques ""collar of twisted metal"", from torquere ""to twist"".


== Torch construction ==
Torch construction has varied through history depending on the torch's purpose. Torches were usually constructed of a wooden stave with one end wrapped in a material which was soaked in a flammable substance. In the United States, black bear bones may have been used. Modern procession torches are made from coarse hessian rolled into a tube and soaked in wax. A wooden handle is usually used, and a cardboard collar is attached to deflect any wax droplets. They are an easy, safe and relatively cheap way to hold a flame aloft in a parade or to provide illumination in any after-dark celebration.
Modern torches suitable for juggling are made of a wooden-and-metal or metal-only stave with one end wrapped in a Kevlar wick. This wick is soaked in a flammable liquid, usually paraffin (kerosene).


== Symbolism ==

The torch is a common emblem of both enlightenment and hope, thus the Statue of Liberty, formally named Liberty Enlightening the World, lifts her torch. Crossed reversed torches were signs of mourning that appear on Greek and Roman funerary monuments—a torch pointed downwards symbolizes death, while a torch held up symbolizes life, truth and the regenerative power of flame. The torch is also a symbol used by political parties, for instance by both Labour (from 1918 to 1980) and the Conservatives (from 1983 to 2006) in the UK, and by the Malta Labour Party. In the seals of schools in the Philippines, the torch symbolizes the vision of education to provide enlightenment to all the students.
The torch is also associated with the Greek goddess of witchcraft known as Hecate in some works of art.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Uses ==


=== Olympics ===

The torch carried in relay by runners is used to light the Olympic flame which burns without interruption until the end of the Games. These torches and the relay tradition were introduced in the 1936 Summer Olympics by Carl Diem, the chairman of the event because during the duration of the Ancient Olympic Games in Olympia, a sacred flame burnt inside of the temple of Hera, kept in custody by her priestess.


=== Juggling ===
Juggling torches are often used as a prop in toss juggling: they can be flipped into the air in an end-over-end motion while being juggled, in the same manner as juggling clubs or juggling knives, but because of their sound and 'trail of flame', they can appear much more impressive to audiences.  To a skilled juggler, there is only a slight chance of being burned, but they are still dangerous.


=== In Roman Catholic liturgy ===
In former times, liturgical torches were carried in Eucharistic processions simply to give light. The Church eventually adopted their use for Solemn High Masses.
According to Adrian Fortescue, the more correct form of liturgical torches are non-freestanding (i.e. cannot stand up on their own). However, today, even in the Vatican, freestanding, tall candles in ornate candle-stick holders have replaced the former type. The torches are carried by torchbearers, who enter at the Sanctus and leave after Communion.
Anglicans of the High Church and some Lutherans use torches in some of their liturgical celebrations as well.


=== Torchlight march ===
Torchlight march is a type of illuminated procession which is held after dark so that torches carried by the participants form a spectacle (other types of an illuminated procession involve candles, lanterns etc).


=== Underwater diving ===
Magnesium torches were used commonly in the 1950s and 1960s as a means of underwater illumination. Magnesium burns with a bright white light, and burns underwater also.


== Associations ==


=== Love ===
The association of a torch with love may date to the Greek and Roman tradition of a wedding torch,
lit in the bride's hearth on her wedding night, then used to light the hearth in her new home. Such a torch is associated with the Greek god of marriage Hymen.
The idiom to carry a torch (for someone) means to love or to be romantically infatuated with someone, especially when such feelings are not reciprocated. It is often used to characterize a situation in which a romantic relationship has ended, but where one partner still loves the other. It is considered by some to be dated, but still in wide usage. A torch song is typically a sentimental love song in which a singer laments an unrequited love.

Meta-religion,"Meta-religion is a theoretical framework developed to compare and understand various world religions by identifying common principles and values that transcend individual traditions. It promotes a rational and critical examination of religious beliefs and practices, seeking a unified perspective that integrates diverse religious experiences. Scholars have used this concept to encourage dialogue between different faiths. In Islamic thought, meta-religion has been particularly influential, offering a way to harmonize varied religious experiences under a single, comprehensive framework.


== Key characteristics ==
Meta-religion is characterized by its emphasis on rational and critical analysis of religious traditions. Rather than evaluating a religion based on preconceptions, it encourages examination through historical and logical reasoning. The framework also considers the possibility that multiple religions might share a common divine origin, expressed through different cultural and historical contexts. This perspective allows for the identification of shared ethical values, promoting dialogue that transcends the boundaries of individual religious traditions. According to Ismail al-Faruqi, meta-religion includes belief in an Ultimate Reality, but it does not aim to test the validity of religions. Instead, it focuses on understanding the broader condition of homo religiosus, the human being as a religious entity. This framework can be applied across different religious contexts to explore common human experiences.


== Historical development ==
The development of the concept of meta-religion has been shaped by scholars who seek to reconcile the diverse religious experiences of humanity. One of the most notable contributors to this field was  Isma'il Raji al-Faruqi, whose work in the late 20th century was influential in Islamic thought. Al-Faruqi proposed a rational approach to the study of religions, suggesting that meta-religion could acknowledge the potential divine origin of religious experiences while critically analyzing their historical manifestations. His vision for meta-religion emphasized shared ethical principles and values as a basis for interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding.
While al-Faruqi's contributions were significant in Islamic thought, similar ideas have appeared in other religious and philosophical traditions. Scholars in the field of comparative religion have explored how diverse religious traditions express universal values, though the language and approach may differ.


== Applications ==
Meta-religion has found applications in various fields, including interfaith dialogue, religious studies, and cultural analysis. In the context of interfaith dialogue, it fosters mutual respect and understanding by highlighting the shared values and ethical principles that different religious traditions uphold. In religious studies, meta-religion provides an interdisciplinary framework that allows scholars to explore the broader contexts of religious phenomena beyond specific theological boundaries. In cultural analysis, it examines how religion influences areas such as art, literature, politics, and social norms, offering insights into how religious ideas shape societal developments.
By focusing on common values and principles, meta-religion aims to facilitate cooperation and dialogue between religious communities worldwide. This broader, more inclusive approach encourages an understanding of how religion intersects with culture and society, making meta-religion relevant beyond a single tradition.


== Criticisms ==
Meta-religion has faced criticism, particularly concerning its tendency to simplify the complexities of individual religious traditions. Critics argue that focusing on commonalities can overlook the theological and ritual differences that are central to many faiths. Furthermore, there is concern that meta-religion might privilege certain philosophical frameworks, particularly those rooted in Western or Islamic thought, over others. Abdulkader Tayob, for instance, critiques al-Faruqi’s approach, suggesting that it may impose a Kantian philosophical framework that aligns with Islamic theology, potentially limiting the space for other religious expressions, such as Sufism or mysticism.
These critiques underscore the challenge of applying meta-religion across diverse traditions without diminishing their distinctiveness. Despite these concerns, proponents of meta-religion, such as al-Faruqi, argue that it remains a useful tool for fostering understanding and engagement with diverse religious perspectives.  Scholars continue to explore the balance between recognizing universal values and maintaining respect for the uniqueness of individual religious experiences.

Rococo,"Rococo is an artistic style which originated in the 18th century in France. Often referred to merely as Late Baroque, the Rococo developed from the Baroque artistic movement. Whilst it kept several characteristics of the original style, including elaboration and ornate themes, it was also more playful and asymmetrical. The Rococo is associated with the reign of French king Louis XV (Louis XIV is associated with the Baroque, whilst Louis XVI with Neoclassicism, albeit his style started off as Rococo at the beginning of reign). Rococo's popularity was at its height towards the middle of the 18th century, fading out by the end in favour of Neoclassicism.
Rococo art and architecture was feminine, graceful, florid and ornate. Creamy and pastel-like colours were used for paintings, unlike the darker shades in Baroque art. Religion and politics were no longer necessarily the core theme of Rococo art, unlike the Baroque, and everyday life became more commonly represented. In such a way, Rococo art revolved around themes such as love, romance, fun, landscapes, and mere portraits. Additionally, Far Eastern themes became popular in Rococo, especially Chinoiserie. Famous Rococo artists include Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard, amongst several others.
The Rococo has been the focus of much discussion, analysis and criticism by art historians throughout history. It has been criticised over the years for being over-the-top, superficial and frivolous; in such a way, the term has even been used derogatively in various points of history. Nevertheless, Rococo art and theatre has also received praise for the elegance, ""beauty"", and ""charm"" of its artwork.

Street art,"Street art is a kind of visual art in a public place. It can include styles of contemporary arts like impressionism, cubism or pop art.
A lot of poor people try to survive by asking a little money in the street. They sometimes do the same while making art. These are the ""original"", ""true"" street artists. They make music, theatre, temporary paintings on the ground. The other ones are more likely called ""urban artist"".


== Street art of New York ==
A spray can is a artistic tool used by writers on the walls in cities like Philadelphia or New York in 1970. This technique is still used but remain considered more or less as vandalism. One of the most important New York writer wrote SEEN on subways in New York.


== Street art of Paris ==
The artist Banksy said in December 2010 in a French newspaper called Le Monde (The world) that he has been influenced by the street art of Paris. For him it is the May 1968 mini revolution that started the street art movement. He also mentioned stencil artist Blek le Rat.


== Land art ==
Land art is an art movement in which the landscape and the work of art are linked. It is also an art form that is created in nature, using natural materials. Christo and Jeanne-Claude were a couple who made illegal art in the street of Paris in 1962 to protest against the Berlin Wall. In 1972, and 1976 they made land art in the desert of California, building a very long fence. In 1985, they made a huge work in Paris. They wrapped the oldest bridge of the city with polyamide fabric. They had to negotiate for years to have the permission of doing it. So it was official but it was controversial.


== Absurd propaganda ==
After the Berlin wall collapsed, a man called Shepard Fairey started gluing images of a dead French wrestler called André the Giant in California. It was a phenomenon. Fairey opened a web site were he just said it was phenomenology. It was so absurd people could not stop talking about it. Stickers were made of the image of the dead wrestler. It was considered ""cool"" by some skateboarders. 
In 1999, in Seattle, took place a WTO (World Trade Organisation) summit. There took place big demonstrations. Others summits took place in Prague (2000) and in Genoa (July 2001). The youth that demonstrate during this summit used ""Absurd Propaganda"", ""culture jamming"" and other artistic techniques to ""reclaim the streets"". After the president Georges W. Bush was elected and the 9/11 (September 2001), the absurd propaganda seemed to have a political meaning. So, critics came to the idea to call that phenomenon artivism. Something part art and part activism.


== The art of invading space ==
In 1999, an artist called Space Invader (who took his name from a video game) started putting little mosaic work in Paris. He started by doing it in a museum called the Louvre. French television showed it. Then he started doing it in every city he could. So he met other artists in other cities. Because his work is not ephemeral but very discreet, the authorities let him do. Only in Amsterdam, the city council decided to officially remove them. 
In the same time he opened a web site so people from around the world could relay and participate. He invited Shepard Fairey in Paris in march 2003. Malcolm McLaren who invented punk was there too.

When agreeing to a contract with a business, a customer may agree to certain rules. If the customer breaks the rules, then they agree to pay a fine for doing so. For example, when somebody hires a car and agrees to return it by Friday, they agree that if they do not return the car by Friday, they must pay a $50 fine to the business.",0
Theodicy,"Theodicy is a branch of theology that seeks to explain why a God that is seen as all-loving, all-seeing, and all-powerful allows evil to exist. The word comes from the Greek words for God and Judgment and so means the judgment of God. It was first made up  by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in 1710 in his work Théodicée. The subject has been the focus of argument and thought for hundreds of years before that and since.
Theodicy tries to explain why God, who has complete free will, has the power to change anything he wants to, can see all the evil in the world and is all-loving and compassionate, yet does nothing to alleviate the suffering in the world, especially the suffering of innocents.
The weakness of the arguments for Theodicy are  often used by atheists to emphasise the problems that go with the belief in God.


== Some arguments ==
There are many arguments to try and explain evil; here is an incomplete list:

The argument of the “Greater Good”. God has a plan for the world which is unfolding as it should; this involves some suffering at the hands of evil for the arrival at a destination for the greater good of all. This is also called the Ultimate Harmony Theodicy .
The Augustinian defence, originating from Saint Augustine of Hippo. God created the world as pure and good but it was spoiled by man through his sins and disobedience of God. This is also known as the Original Sin Theodicy, which says that evil came into the world because of humanity's original sin and so is the creation of humanity, not God.
The  Irenaean  theodicy which was made by Irenaeus, a bishop who died in AD 202. This argues that God gave man free will, in other words the freedom to choose to do good or evil; this allows for the moral development of man.
The Finite God Theodicy says that God is all-good but not all-powerful and so cannot prevent evil.
""The best of all possible worlds"" theodicy, which was thought up by Leibniz in 1710, says that God, because he is an infinitely perfect being, created a world that has the greatest possible balance of good and evil.
Some forms of reincarnation believe that people suffer evil as a punishment for their wrong-doing in a previous life.
Contrast Theodicy holds that evil is needed to enable people to appreciate or understand good.
Warning Theodicy rationalizes evil as God’s warning to people to mend their ways.

Glasgow Coma Scale,"Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a scale that is used to measure the consciousness of a person. It was invented in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J. Jennett, professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow.
GCS is used in evaluation of patients, especially in ICUs. This scale consists of three tests, which are described below. A score is given for each test, and the GCS score is calculated by adding the scores given to each test. The maximum score is 15, which means the patient is fully conscious. The minimum score is 3, and is usually seen in patients with brain death or those in deep coma.


== Elements of the scale ==

The scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal (talking) and motor (movement) responses.


=== Best eye response (E) ===
There are 4 grades for this test:

No eye opening
Eye opening in response to pain (for example when his sternum is pressed firmly).
Eye opening to speech (that is, when he is called).
Eyes opening by himself (normally).


=== Best verbal response (V) ===
There are 5 grades for this test:

No verbal response (not talking at all).
Meaking meaningless sounds (that is, moaning but no words).
Inappropriate words (like random speech, without being able to communicate correctly).
Confused. (The patient responds to questions but there is some confusion).
Oriented. (Patient responds appropriately to questions such as the patient’s name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.).


=== Best motor response (M) ===
There are 6 grades for this test:

No motor response (no movement at all).
Extension in response to pain (decerebrate response: adduction, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm).
Flexion in response to pain (decorticate response).
Withdrawing from pain (pulling part of body away when pinched).
Localizing to pain. (Purposeful movements towards the painful location).
Obeys commands. (The patient does simple things he is asked to do).

Electric match,"An electric match is a device that uses electricity to ignite a flammable compound. Usually, it is made of two wires. When an electric  current is applied to the two wires, they will ignite the compound. Electric matches are used when it is important to know the exact time at which the compound catches fire. Example uses include airbags, pyrotechnic devices (fireworks) and explosives. 
Because they can be used to ignite explosives, some countries have trade restrictions on electric matches.",0
Factory glass,"Factory glass is a term used by collectors of art glass to distinguish relevant items, mostly of decorative rather than utilitarian glass, from the more individual or unique studio glass and by studio glass artists to distinguish their work from the more standardised items which are generally made in larger glassworks.  It can be an equivalent for the 20th century of the term art glass, which is largely applied to 19th-century or early 20th-century pieces.
It is difficult to specify how large a glassworks would be before it is considered a factory but size is not the key indicator. The crucial distinction would be where there is a significant degree of specialisation or ""division of labour"" as opposed to the more hands-on working methods used by a single glass artist, with perhaps an assistant, in a studio.


== Exceptions ==
Not all glass made in factories counts because more individual, limited edition or one-off pieces were made for a variety of reasons. Examples would include; experimental, ""end-of-day"" and apprentice  pieces and ""friggers"" (test or trial pieces) but also special orders and one-off commissions.


=== Factory ""studio"" glass"" ===
At Fenton, Dave Fetty, a factory glass worker for most of his career, was allowed to use specialist skills, learned before joining the factory, in limited editions of ""offhand"" pieces without the use of moulds. Such pieces are more akin to studio glass than ""factory glass"".
In the United Kingdom, Whitefriars and Caithness, have produced limited production ""studio"" lines alongside standard production in the same factory.
At the ZBS glassworks in Czechoslovakia, there was a separate department for making more experimental studio type pieces which were later hived off and came to be called Libera. The small Skrdlovice works was used by designers in the communist era to test out their designs with short runs before some went on to full production at other factories. The limited test items are much more prized by collectors but it is often difficult to be sure which ones these are and which ones were replicated in full production runs elsewhere.


== Standardised production ==
While, the exceptions would generally account for a very small proportion of overall production, the term applies, strictly speaking, only to the production which was standardised, where many workers would be involved in the making of each item.


== Other types of glass made in factories ==
The many other types of glass which are generally made in factories are usually referred to by their individual names; for example; float glass (for windows) and ""glass packaging"" (bottles, jars, and containers) and domestic glassware.

Payment,"A payment is the transfer of something from one party to another.  Giving money to a company is a payment, for example.  A payment is usually made for goods or services.
The oldest form of payment is barter.  Barter is a simple form of payment.  It is the transfer of one good or service for another. 
Today, payment is usually with money, cheque, debit, credit, bank transfer, or mobile payment.  In transfers between businesses, sometimes payments can be complicated, with stock and other things.

Wooden bicycle,"A wooden bicycle is a bicycle constructed either mostly, or entirely from wood. Wood was the material used in the earliest bicycles, and is also used by modern builders, especially in balance bicycles for children. The wood can be either solid or laminate.


== History ==
The first bicycles recorded, known variously as velocipedes, dandy horses, or hobby horses, were constructed from wood, starting in 1817. 


== Modern ==
Recent technological advances in adhesives and fabrication have made wood a feasible choice in the modern cycle world.
Wooden bicycle frames are sometimes aided by steel or composite lugs to connect the wooden tubes or attach components. These frames can be made with plywood, hardwoods, or bamboo.

Partition editor,"Partition editor, partitioner, and partitioning utility are all names for computer programs used to view, create, change, and delete disk partitions on a computer storage device, most commonly a hard disk, but also a USB flash drive or other storage medium.
A partition is a section or segment of the space on a storage device. By partitioning a large device into several partitions it is possible to isolate various types of data from one another, and allow the coexistence of two or more operating systems simultaneously.
Partition editors can come in many different forms. Command line tools such as diskpart in Windows and fdisk or parted in Linux offer accurate control of partition editing. Graphical tools like Disk Management in Windows and GParted or KDE Partition Manager allow for use by less skilled users.

Firewall (networking),"In terms of computer security, a firewall is a piece of  software. This software monitors the network traffic between the inside and outside. The firewall is placed between the network that is to be protected (trusted) and the outside network (less trusted) aka WAN or Internet. A firewall has a set of rules which are applied to each packet. The rules decide if a packet can pass, or whether it is discarded. When a large network needs to be protected, the firewall software often runs on a computer that does nothing else. 
A firewall protects one part of the network against unauthorized access.


== Different kinds of Firewalls ==


=== Packet filtering / Network Layer ===
Data travels on the internet in small pieces; these are called packets. Each packet has certain metadata attached, like where it is coming from, and where it should be sent to. The easiest thing to do is to look at the metadata. Based on rules, certain packets are then dropped or rejected. It is done at the network layer.


=== Stateful packet inspection ===
In addition to the simple packet filtering (above), this kind of firewall also keeps track of connections. A packet can be the start of a new connection, or it can be part of an existing connection. If it is neither of the two, it is probably useless and can be dropped.


=== Application-layer firewalls ===
Application-layer firewalls do not just look at the metadata; they also look at the actual data transported. They know how certain protocols work, for example  FTP or HTTP. They can then look if the data that is in the packet is valid (for that protocol). If it is not, it can be dropped.


== Other things firewalls are used for ==


=== Tunneling ===
Firewalls can provide a secure connection between two networks. This is called tunnellng. The data may be encrypted. It is decrypted at the other end. Since the firewalls are doing this, the rest of the network is unaware of it. An alternative is to provide a secure access (to the corporate network).


== Network Address Translation (NAT) ==
Very often, firewalls can translate IP addresses. That way, many computers can share a few public IP addresses. The firewall translates between the public and the private IP addresses.


== Types of firewalls ==
In general, there are two types of firewalls:

Software-based firewalls: these are often run as additional programs on computers that are used for other things. They are often known as personal firewalls which can be updates on personal computers.
Prominent Brands include OPNsense, pfsense, comodo etc.

Hardware-based firewalls: Hardware based firewalls run on a dedicated computer (or appliance). Often, these offer a better performance than software firewalls, but they are also more money.
Prominent Brands include PaloAlto, WiJungle, Checkpoint, Cisco etc.


== What firewalls cannot protect against ==
Firewalls can protect against some problems (viruses and attacks) that come from the internet. They cannot protect against viruses, that come from infected media (like an infected office document on an USB flash drive).",0
Lever,"A lever is a simple machine. It is something that can be used in a lot of ways. One way is by measuring things, or by seeing which weighs more. A lever is supported by a fulcrum which it uses to lifts weights. It is one of six simple machines. There are three types of levers: first-class, second-class and third-class.


== Early ==
The earliest remaining writings about levers are from the 3rd century BC. They were written by Archimedes. ""Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth."" is a famous quote from Archimedes who stated the correct mathematical principle of levers (quoted by Pappus of Alexandria).


== Types of levers ==
There are three kinds of levers. The difference between them is where the fulcrum is and where the forces are acting.


=== First class ===

A first-class lever is a lever where the fulcrum is in between the effort and resistance (the load). Seesaws and crowbars are examples of first class levers.


=== Second class ===
A second-class lever is where the resistance is between the effort and the fulcrum. Wheel barrows and wrenches are examples of second class levers.


=== Third class ===
A third class lever is where the effort is between the resistance and the fulcrum. Staplers and your forearm are examples of third class levers.

Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory,"Timoshenko beam theory, named after the Ukrainian-American engineer Stephen Timoshenko, is a classical engineering theory that describes the behavior of beams. It is an extension of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which assumes that the cross-sections of the beam remain perpendicular to the axis of deformation during bending. Timoshenko beam theory, on the other hand, takes into account the effects of shear deformation and rotational inertia.",0
Term (architecture),"In Classical architecture and in art a term or terminal figure (pl.: terms or termini) is a human head and bust that continues down as a square tapering pillar-like form. It is usually distinguished from a herm, which has a head and shoulders only, but the two words may be used rather loosely and interchangeably.
The god Terminus was the Etruscan and Roman deity of boundaries, and classical sources say that boundary markers often took the form of a half-figure of the god on a pillar, though ancient survivals in this form are extremely rare.  
In the architecture and the painted architectural decoration of the European Renaissance and the succeeding Classical styles, term figures are quite common. Often they represent minor deities associated with fields and vineyards and the edges of woodland, Pan and fauns and Bacchantes especially, and they may be draped with garlands of fruit and flowers.
Term figures were a particularly characteristic feature of the 16th-century style in furniture and carved interior decoration that is called Antwerp Mannerism. Ornament prints, such as a set of 20 School of Fontainebleau etchings from the 1540s usually given to Jean Mignon, disseminated the style through Germany and England.  In these very fanciful Mannerist creations, many of the forms dip in and out of architectural and anatomical shapes.

X Window System,"The X Window System is a set of protocols and programs. It is also known as X11, or simply X. It can manage windows, and other components of a graphical user interface (GUI) on a bitmap display. This way of doing graphics is most common in Unix-like operating systems.
X provides the basic components to build GUI environments: drawing and moving windows on the screen and interacting with a mouse or a keyboard. X does not say what the user interface should look like – different client programs handle this. Different X11-based environments have radically different designs. X is not a part of the operating system; instead, it is built as an additional program on top of the operating system.
Unlike display protocols from before, X was specifically designed to be used over network connections rather than on a display near the computer. X has network transparency: the machine where an application program (the client application) runs need not be the user's local machine (the display server).
X was developed at MIT in 1984. The current protocol version, X11, appeared in September 1987. The X.Org Foundation leads the X project, with the current reference implementation, version 11 release 7.7 (6 June 2012), available as free software under the MIT License and similar permissive licenses.

Stained glass,"Stained glass is glass coloured by adding metallic salts when it is made. The coloured glass is made into stained glass windows. Small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures. The glass is held together  by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame.
Painted details and yellow stain are often used to improve the design. The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.
Stained glass is much used in Christian art but other themes are not rare. It is still popular today, and often called art glass. It is often used in luxury homes and commercial buildings.
Some colours are added to stained glass by the salts of:

Copper: metal gives dark red glass
Gold: metal in tiny amounts (0.001%) produces ruby red glass
Silver, usually silver nitrate, gives range of red to yellow colours
Cobalt: brilliant blue
Manganese dioxide: green
Iron(II) oxide: blue-green
Chromium: dark green

Binder (material),"A binder or binding agent is any material or substance that holds or draws other materials together to form a cohesive whole mechanically, chemically, by adhesion or cohesion.
More narrowly, binders are liquid or dough-like substances that harden by a chemical or physical process and bind fibres, filler powder and other particles added into it. Examples include glue, adhesive and thickening.
Examples of mechanical binders are bond stones in masonry and tie beams in timber framing.


== Classification ==
Binders are loosely classified as organic (bitums, animal and plant glues, polymers) and inorganic (lime, cement, gypsum, liquid glass, etc.). These can be either metallic or ceramic as well as polymeric depending on the nature of the main material. For example, in the compound WC-Co (Tungsten Carbide used in cutting tools) Co constitutes the binding agent for the WC particles.
Based on their chemical resistance, binders are classified by the field of use: non-hydraulic (gypsum, air-cements, magnesia, hydrated lime), hydraulic (Roman cement, portland cement, hydraulic lime), acid-resistant (silicon fluoride cement, quartz cement), and autoclavable (harden at 170 to 300°С i.e. 8-16 atm pressure and, e.g., comprise CaSiO3 materials).


== Physical properties ==
Some materials labeled as binders such as cement have a high compressive strength but low tensile strength and need to be reinforced with fibrous material or rebar if tension and shear forces will be applied.
Other binding agents such as resins may be tough and possibly elastic but can neither bear compressive nor tensile force. Tensile strength is greatly improved in composite materials consisting of resin as the matrix and fiber as a reinforcement. Compressive strength can be improved by adding filling material.


== Uses ==
Binders hold together pigments and sometimes filling material to form paints, pastels, and other materials used for artistic and utilitarian painting. Materials include wax, linseed oil, natural gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, or proteins such as egg white or casein. Glue is traditionally made by the boiling of hoofs, bones, or skin of animals and then mixing the hard gelatinous residue with water. Natural gum-based binders are made from substances extracted from plants. Larger amounts of dry substance are added to liquid binders in order to cast or model sculptures and reliefs.
In cooking, various edible thickening agents are used as binders. Some of them, e.g. tapioca flour, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and various starches are also used in pharmacology in making tablets. Tablet binders include lactose powder, sucrose powder, tapioca starch (cassava flour) and microcrystalline cellulose.
In building construction, concrete uses cement as a binder.  Asphalt pavement uses bitumen binder. Traditionally straw and natural fibres are used to strengthen clay in wattle-and-daub construction and in the building material cob which would otherwise become brittle after drying. Sand is added to improve compressive strength, hardness and reduce shrinkage. The binding property of clay is also used widely to prepare shaped articles (e.g. pots and vases) or to bind solid pieces (e.g. bricks).
In composite materials, epoxy, polyester or phenolic resins are common. In reinforced carbon–carbon, plastic or pitch resin is used as a source of carbon released through pyrolysis. Transite, hypertufa, papercrete and petecrete used cement as a binder.
In explosives, wax or polymers like polyisobutylene or styrene-butadiene rubber are often used as binders for plastic explosives. For polymer-bonded explosives, various synthetic polymers are used.
In rocket fuels, polybutadiene acrylonitrile copolymer was used in 1960-70's big solid-fuel booster rocket fuels.
Organic binders, designed to disintegrate by heat during baking, are used in sintering.


== History ==
In the Classical World painters used materials like egg, wax, honey, lime, casein, linseed oil or bitumen as binders to mix with pigment in order to hold the pigment particles together in the formation of paint. Egg-based tempera was especially popular in Europe from the Middle Ages until the early 16th century. However, since that time, the binder of choice for paint has been oil.

Softwood,"Softwood is wood that comes from gymnosperm trees. These are conifers, a term which includes most evergreen and deciduous trees. 
Softwood makes up about 80% of the world's production of lumber.  Traditional production areas include North America, Scandinavia, Baltic countries and China. The opposite of softwood is hardwood, which is wood that comes from angiosperm trees. Softwoods are not always softer than hardwoods. Both groups include a variety of wood types that vary in actual hardness. For example balsa is a hardwood but is softer than most softwoods. Douglas fir, a softwood, is much harder than many hardwoods.

Marudai,"A marudai (丸台, lit. 'round stand') is the most common of the traditional frames used for making kumihimo, a type of Japanese braid.


== Etymology ==
The marudai is generally made of a close-grained wood and consists of a round disk (kagami or ""mirror"") with a hole in the center, supported by four legs set in a base. The Japanese style marudai is often about 16 in (41 cm) high and is used while kneeling or when placed on a table. The Western style 26 in (66 cm) marudai allows the braider to sit in a chair to braid.
The warp threads that form the braid are wound around weighted bobbins called tama (lit. 'egg'). Tama were once made of clay, but now are most commonly wood filled with lead. The weight of the tama maintains even tension on the warp threads, and is balanced by a bag of counterweights called omori that is attached to the base of the braid.
Modern braiders often replace the marudai with a foam disk with numbered slots that tightly grip the warp threads to maintain warp tension, so that weighted bobbins are not needed; instead, flexible plastic bobbins are used to prevent tangling of the threads. Unlike kumihimo disks, marudai have no indication of where the thread should be placed; it is done freehand.


== Related terms ==
Kagami – ""Mirror"", the polished wooden top disk of the marudai.
Kongō Gumi – a class of patterns for round cord all involving eight threads folded in half for a total of sixteen strands. In clockwise order, each bobbins is moved to the opposite side. When different combinations of thread color are used, many interesting patterns emerge, including diagonal stripes, diamonds on a background, triangles resembling hearts, and tiny six-petalled flowers. Kongō Gumi is named for the venerable Kongō Gumi company of Japan, the oldest known company in the world.
Kumihimo or kumi himo – Japanese for ""gathered threads"".
Obi – the broad cloth sash worn with kimono; kumihimo braids are often used as obijime, worn on top of the obi.
Obijime – the cord used to fasten the obi securely in some obi styles. Usually one string of kumihimo is tied around the obi securely, and an accessory called the obidome is often added in front for decoration.
Omori – Counterweights used in kumihimo braiding.
Takadai – a rectangular or square frame for kumihimo.
Tama – little spools. The thread is kept from unwinding by passing the thread under itself, forming a loop around the tama.
True silk – a hollow fiber with a rough surface that resists slipping past the loop unless gently pulled. For synthetic fibers, a flexible plastic ""clamshell"" bobbin may be preferable.

List of medical abbreviations,"Medical abbreviations are a shorthand way of writing and talking by medical professionals (people who work to help sick people) to hurry explanation of diseases (sickness), patients, or medicines (drugs).
This shorthand can include shortening (making less lengthy) of longer disease names, by cutting the word down to its base (the Latin or Greek part that makes it). Medical professionals also create (make) words that mean something. An example of this is ""stat"", used to indicate (show) that something needs to be hurried (done faster). It is from the Latin ""base word"" statim, meaning quick. A very commonly (often) used shorthand is shortening things on order forms for patients. An example is, ""pre-op"" meaning |pre-operation| (patient who is being prepared for surgery). These can be very complicated and extensive (meaning there is a lot of them).
Despite the fact that this shorthand might make it difficult for new Interns (new doctors) or recently trained nurses to get used to this unofficial language, it has been shown to improve (make better) the speed of treatment in hospitals.
Medical authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have questioned the use of medical shorthand; believing that it can lead to mistakes being made due to less clear communication and have advised doctors to avoid its use.

Cryonics,"Cryonics (from Greek kryos, which means 'cold') is the process of vitrifying a human (or animal) about −196 degrees Celsius (−321 degrees Fahrenheit; 77 kelvins) after a doctor says they are dead. People do that in hope that, in the future when medicine becomes better, they can have life again, solve their health problems and have eternal life.
Cold people like this are not awake at all as they have no brain activity. The law also says they are dead. Their body and its brain are made more like glass than ice because ice would harm their cells more. To do this, their blood is replaced with chemicals called cryoprotectants, which act like anti-freeze (something that stops freezing).


== Companies ==
There are five big cryonics companies:

Alcor, Arizona, USA
Cryonics Institute (CI), Michigan, USA
American Cryonics Society (ACS), California, USA

Coconut timber,"Coconut timber is a hardwood-substitute from coconut palm trees. It is referred to in the Philippines as coconut lumber, or coco lumber, and elsewhere additionally as cocowood or red palm. It is a new timber resource that comes from plantation crops and offers an alternative to rainforest timber.


== Background ==
Coconut timber comes from farmed plantations of old coconut palms. The coconut palm was planted as a crop in large plantations throughout the tropics in the early half of the 20th century in order to harvest the coconut fruit. The tree bears fruit until approximately 70 years of age, at which point it is considered to have reached the end of its economic life and is felled to make way for future crops. Each year, several million palms are felled throughout the tropics. Traditionally, the trunks have been wasted by-products from this process.
Only in very recent years have people begun to explore the potential commercial uses for this vast, alternative supply of timber. This led to the commercial launch of coconut timber in a range of different products, from flooring to posts to furniture. With these products performing at equal to or even better than conventional hardwoods, coconut timber represents a viable substitute for endangered hardwoods from an ecologically-sound source.


== Characteristics ==

Its wood is reminiscent in appearance to mahogany; however, coconut timber has a much more fibrous grain than mahogany and lacks mahogany's iridescence. Colour tones and hues range from golden to near ebony, with dark brown flecks. There are three basic colour divisions relating to the timber's density: dark brown tones (high density); medium brown tones (medium density); and light golden tones (low density).
Coconut trees have no annual growth rings, rays, heartwood or branches, meaning that coconut timber is free from knots and other such imperfections.


== Properties ==
The coconut palm is a monocotyledon. It has a smooth, slender stem that grows to a height of about 25 metres and with an average diameter of 300 mm. The hardest, densest part of the wood is found on the outer perimeter of the trunk, which gives the tree its strength, while the wood's high silica content gives the tree elasticity. Towards the centre of the trunk, the wood gets less hard. The wood has a Janka ball hardness of 112.5 - 154.7 kgf/cm2 (1600 – 2200 psi), which is greater than that of oak (70.3 - 84.4 kgf/cm2) and Douglas fir (35.9 kgf/cm2).
Coconut timber is classified according to three degrees of density:

High-density timber (dermal) – hard: 600–900 kg/m3
Medium-density timber (sub-dermal) – medium/hard: 400–600 kg/m3
Low-density timber (core) – soft/medium: 200–400 kg/m3


== Uses ==

Coconut timber has many applications as both a structural and interior design material. The harder, high-density timber is suitable for general structural purposes such as pillars, trusses, rafting, furniture, window and door frames, floors, decking and floor joists. Medium density coconut timber can be used for walls, ceiling joists and horizontal studs. Low density coconut timber is used in non-load bearing applications like wood panelling, internal trim and ceilings, as well as homewares.
Coconut timber supplied by Pacific Green is to be used in exterior applications throughout Abu Dhabi's Masdar City development, including the entrance gates, screens and doors.
Chemicals:
Activated carbon can also be made from coconut trunk charcoal. The product can be used to manufacture various chemicals such as carbon disulphide, calcium carbide, silicon carbide, carbon monoxide, paint pigments, pharmaceuticals, molding resins, black powder, electrodes,
catalyst reactors, brake linings, and gas cylinder absorbent. Ethanol can also be produced from coconut waste products.


== Economic impact ==
Coconut timber is a source of income for less developed South Pacific island communities. The previously low value older coconut trunks have been promoted as a source of veneer and other wood products.

Pycnonuclear fusion,"Pycnonuclear fusion (Ancient Greek: πυκνός, romanized: pyknós, lit. 'dense, compact, thick') is a type of nuclear fusion reaction which occurs due to zero-point oscillations of nuclei around their equilibrium point bound in their crystal lattice. In quantum physics, the phenomenon can be interpreted as overlap of the wave functions of neighboring ions, and is proportional to the overlapping amplitude. Under the conditions of above-threshold ionization, the reactions of neutronization and pycnonuclear fusion can lead to the creation of absolutely stable environments in superdense substances.
The term ""pycnonuclear"" was coined by A.G.W. Cameron in 1959, but research showing the possibility of nuclear fusion in extremely dense and cold compositions was published by W. A. Wildhack in 1940.


== Astrophysics ==
Pycnonuclear reactions can occur anywhere and in any matter, but under standard conditions, the speed of the reaction is exceedingly low, and thus, have no significant role outside of extremely dense systems, neutron-rich and free electron-rich environments, such as the inner crust of a neutron star. A feature of pycnonuclear reactions is that the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the density of the space that the reaction is occurring in, but is almost fully independent of the temperature of the environment.
Pycnonuclear reactions are observed in neutron stars or white dwarfs, with evidence present of them occurring in lab-generated deuterium-tritium plasma. Some speculations also relate the fact that Jupiter emits more radiation than it receives from the Sun with pycnonuclear reactions or cold fusion.


=== Black dwarfs ===


=== White dwarfs ===
In white dwarfs, the core of the star is cold, under which conditions, so, if treated classically, the nuclei that arrange themselves into a crystal lattice are in their ground state. The zero-point oscillations of nuclei in the crystal lattice with energy at the energy

    {\displaystyle E_{0}\thicksim \hbar w}
  
 can overcome the Coulomb barrier, actuating pycnonuclear reactions. A semi-analytical model indicates that in white dwarfs, a thermonuclear runaway can occur at much earlier ages than that of the universe, as the pycnonuclear reactions in the cores of white dwarfs exceed the luminosity of the white dwarfs, allowing C-burning to occur, which catalyzes the formation of type Ia supernovas in accreting white dwarfs, whose mass is equal to the Chandrasekhar mass.
Some studies indicate that the contribution of pycnonuclear reactions towards instability of white dwarfs is only significant in carbon white dwarfs, while in oxygen white dwarfs, such instability is caused mostly due to electron capture. Although other authors disagree that the pycnonuclear reactions can act as major long-term heating sources for massive (1.25 M☉) white dwarfs, as their density would not suffice for a high rate of pycnonuclear reactions.
While most studies indicate that at the end of their lifecycle, white dwarfs slowly decay into black dwarfs, where pycnonuclear reactions slowly turn their cores into

 production, they will exceed the Chandrasekhar limit in the very far future, speculating that their lifetime and delay time can stretch to up to 101100 years.


=== Neutron stars ===

As the neutron stars undergo accretion, the density in the crust increases, passing the electron capture threshold. As the electron capture threshold (

νe), forming the light neon nuclei and free neutrons, which further increases the density of the crust.  As the density increases, the crystal lattices of neutron-rich nuclei are forced closer together due to gravitational collapse of accreting material, and at a point where the nuclei are pushed so close together that their zero-point oscillations allow them to break through the Coulomb barrier, fusion occurs. While the main site of pycnonuclear fusion within neutron stars is the inner crust, pycnonuclear reactions between light nuclei can occur even in the plasma ocean. Since the core of neutron stars was approximated to be

) releases a lot of heat, allowing pycnonuclear fusion to perform as a major energy source, possibly even acting as an energy basin for gamma-ray bursts.
Further studies have established that most magnetars are found at densities of

In Wolf–Rayet stars, the triple-alpha reaction is accommodated by the low-energy of 
  
    
      
        
          
            Be

 resonance. However, in neutron stars the temperature in the core is so low that the triple-alpha reactions can occur via the pycnonuclear pathway.


== Mathematical model ==

As the density increases, the Gamow peak increases in height and shifts towards lower energy, while the potential barriers are depressed. If the potential barriers are depressed by the amount of

    {\displaystyle E_{0}}
  
, the Gamow peak is shifted across the origin, making the reactions density-dependent, as the Gamow peak energy is much larger than the thermal energy. The material becomes a degenerate gas at such densities. Harrison proposed that models fully independent of temperature be called cryonuclear.
Pycnonuclear reactions can proceed in two ways: direct (

).


=== Uncertainties ===
The current consensus on the rate of pycnonuclear reactions is not coherent. There are currently a lot of uncertainties to consider when modelling the rate of pycnonuclear reactions, especially in spaces with high numbers of free particles. The primary focus of current research is on the effects of crystal lattice deformation and the presence of free neutrons on the reaction rate. Every time fusion occurs, nuclei are removed from the crystal lattice - creating a defect. The difficulty of approximating this model lies within the fact that the further changes occurring to the lattice and the effect of various deformations on the rate are thus far unknown. Since neighbouring lattices can affect the rate of reaction too, negligence of such deformations could lead to major discrepancies. Another confounding variable would be the presence of free neutrons in the crusts of neutron stars. The presence of free neutrons could potentially affect the Coulomb barrier, making it either taller or thicker. A study published by D.G. Yakovlev in 2006 has shown that the rate calculation of the first pycnonuclear fusion of two 
  
    
      
        
          
            Ne

    {\displaystyle {\ce {^{34}Ne}}}
  
 nuclei in the crust of a neutron star can have an uncertainty magnitude of up to seven. In this study, Yakovlev also highlighted the uncertainty in the threshold of pycnonuclear fusion (e.g., at what density it starts), giving the approximate density required for the start of pycnonuclear fusion of

g cm−3, arriving at a similar conclusion as Haesnel and Zdunik. According to Haesnel and Zdunik, additional uncertainty of rate calculations in neutron stars can also be due to uneven distribution of the crustal heating, which can impact the thermal states of neutron stars before and after accretion.
In white dwarfs and neutron stars, the nuclear reaction rates can not only be affected by pycnonuclear reactions but also by the plasma screening of the Coulomb interaction. A Ukrainian Electrodynamic Research Laboratory ""Proton-21"", established that by forming a thin electron plasma layer on the surface of the target material, and, thus, forcing the self-compression of the target material at low temperatures, they could stimulate the process of pycnonuclear fusion. The startup of the process was due to the self-contracting plasma ""scanning"" the entire volume of the target material, screening the Coulomb field.


=== Screening, Quantum Diffusion & Nuclear Fusion Regimes ===
Before delving into the mathematical model, it is important to understand that pycnonuclear fusion, in its essence, occurs due to two main events:

A phenomenon of quantum nature called quantum diffusion.
Overlap of the wave functions of zero-point oscillations of the nuclei.
Both of these effects are heavily affected by screening. The term screening is generally used by nuclear physicists when referring to plasmas of particularly high density. In order for the pycnonuclear fusion to occur, the two particles must overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them - the energy required for this is called the Coulomb barrier. Due to the presence of other charged particles (mainly electrons) next to the reacting pair, they exert the effect of shielding - as the electrons create an electron cloud around the positively charged ions - effectively reducing the electrostatic repulsion between them, lowering the Coulomb barrier. This phenomenon of shielding is referred to as ""screening"", and in cases where it is particularly strong, it is called ""strong screening"". Consequently, in cases where the plasma has a strong screening effect, the rate of pycnonuclear fusion is substantially enhanced.
Quantum tunnelling is the foundation of the quantum physical approach to pycnonuclear fusion. It is closely intertwined with the screening effect, as the transmission coefficient 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
  
 depends on the height of the potential barrier, the mass of the particles, and their relative velocity (since the total energy of the system depends on the kinetic energy). From this follows that the transmission coefficient is very sensitive to the effects of screening. Thus, the effect of screening not only contributes to the reduction of the potential barrier that allows for ""classical"" fusion to occur via the overlap of the wave functions of the zero-point oscillations of the particles, but also to the increase of the transmission coefficient, both of which increase the rate of pycnonuclear fusion.
On top of the other various jargon related to pycnonuclear fusion, the papers also introduce various regimes, that define the rate of pycnonuclear fusion. Specifically, they identify the zero-temperature, intermediate, and thermally-enhanced regimes as their main ones.


==== One-Component Plasma (OCP) ====
The pioneers to the derivation of the rate of pycnonuclear fusion in one-component plasma (OCP) were Edwin Salpeter and David Van-Horn, with their article published in 1969. Their approach used a semiclassical method to solve the Schrödinger equation by using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, and Wigner-Seitz (WS) spheres. Their model is heavily simplified, and whilst it is primitive, is required to understand other approaches which largely extrapolated on the works of Salpeter & Van Horn. They employed the WS spheres to simplify the OCP into regions containing one ion each, with the ions situated on the vertices of a BCC crystal lattice. Then, using the WKB approximation, they resolved the effect of quantum tunnelling on the fusing nuclei. Extrapolating this to the entire lattice allowed them to arrive at their formula for the rate of pycnonuclear fusion:

However, the big fault of the method proposed by Salpeter & Van-Horn is that they neglected the dynamic model of the lattice. This was improved upon by Schramm and Koonin in 1990. In their model, they found that the dynamic model cannot be neglected, but it is possible that the effects caused by the dynamicity can be cancelled out.

Steam engine,"A steam engine is an engine that uses steam from boiling water to make it move. The steam pushes on the engine parts to make them move. Steam engines can power many kinds of machines including vehicles and electric generators. 
Steam engines were used in mine pumps starting in the early 1700s century and were much improved by James Watt in the 1770s. They were very important during the industrial revolution where they replaced horses, windmills and watermills to work machines.
The first steam engines were piston engines. The steam pressure pushed on a piston which made it move along a cylinder and so they had a reciprocal (back-and-forth) motion. This could move a pump directly or work a crank to turn a wheel and work a machine. They operated at low pressure and had to be very big to make a lot of power.
Steam engines were used in factories to work machines and in mines to move pumps. Later smaller engines were built that could move railway locomotives and steam boats.
The steam to power a steam engine is made in a boiler that heats water to make steam. In most places fire heats the boiler. Fuel for the fire may be wood, coal, or petroleum. Nuclear energy or solar energy may be used instead of fire. The steam coming out of the boiler applies the force on a piston. A valve sends the steam to one end of the piston, then the other, to make it move backwards and forwards. The moving piston pushes and pulls the piston rod, crosshead and connecting rod, to turn wheels or drive other machinery. The heavy spinning flywheel smooths out the power from the piston. The governor controls the speed of the engine.
Today many steam engines are still at work. During the 20th century the pistons were replaced by turbines which spin like a windmill pushed by jets of steam. These turn faster with more energy efficiency than the original kinds of piston steam engines. They are used in power plants to operate generators which make electricity. Some ships are also powered by steam turbines. The boilers of steam turbines can be heated by many different types of fuel, even a nuclear reactor in some power stations and warships.

Renewable energy sculpture,"A renewable energy sculpture is an artwork that produces power from renewable sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric or tidal.
Such a sculpture is functionally both a renewable energy generator and a work of art, fulfilling utilitarian, aesthetic, and cultural functions.  The idea of renewable energy sculptures has been developed by artists including Patrice Stellest, Sarah Hall, Julian H. Scaff, Patrick Marold, Elena Paroucheva, architects Laurie Chetwood and Nicholas Grimshaw, University of Illinois professor Bil Becket, and collaborations such as the Land Art Generator Initiative.  Echoing the philosophy of the environmental art movement as a whole, artists creating renewable energy sculpture believe that the aesthetics of the artworks are inextricably linked to their ecological function.

Planetary science,"Planetary science (or planetology) is the organized study of planets, which are relatively large, stable bodies in orbits around stars.
The planet best known to us is the Earth. There are seven other major planets in the Solar System. The Solar System also has dwarf planets, such as Pluto and Ceres, the largest asteroid. 
Space probes have gone near or landed on all planets in our solar system. In recent decades better telescopes have found planets in solar systems other than our own, which are known as exoplanets. One of the first was a planet found to be orbiting Barnard's star. 
Planetary science is a part of astronomy and geology. It is sometimes referred to as planetary geology.
Planetary science in a broad sense includes finding a planet's orbital period and orbital distance from its star, the mineral makeup of the planet, and an attempt to learn its age. It may also have a more narrow focus, such as the mapping of the planet's surface features and the makeup of its atmosphere.

Error code,"In computing, an error code (or a return code) is a numeric or alphanumeric code that indicates the nature of an error and, when possible, why it occurred. Error codes can be reported to end users of software, returned from communication protocols, or used within programs as a method of representing anomalous conditions.


== In consumer products ==

Error codes are commonly encountered on displays of consumer electronics to users in order to communicate or specify an error. They are commonly reported by consumer electronics when users bring electronics to perform tasks that they cannot do (e.g., dividing by zero), or when the program within a device encounters an anomalous condition.
Error codes reported by consumer electronics are used to help diagnose and repair technical problems. An error code can be communicated to relevant support staff to identify potential fixes, or can simplify research into the cause of an error.
There is no definitive format for error codes, meaning that error codes typically differ from/between products and or companies.


== In computer programming ==
Error codes in computers can be passed to the system itself, to judge how to respond to the error. Often error codes come synonymous with an exit code or a return value. The system may also choose to pass the error code to its user(s). The Blue screen of death is an example of how the Windows operating system communicates error codes to the user.
Error codes can be used within a computer program to represent an anomalous condition. A computer program can take different actions depending on the value of an error code.
Different programming languages, operating systems, and programming environments often have their own conventions and standards for the meanings and values of error codes. Examples include:

Unix-like systems have an errno.h header file that contains the meanings and values of error codes returned by system calls and library functions.
Microsoft Windows' application programming interfaces (APIs) have several different standards for error code values, depending on the specific API being used.
The usage of error codes as an error handling strategy is often contrasted against using exceptions for error handling.


== In communication protocols ==
Communication protocols typically define a standard set of error codes, as a means of communicating the status or result of an operation between the entities in the system.
Several high-level protocols in the TCP/IP stack, such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, define their own standard sets of error codes:

List of HTTP status codes
List of FTP server return codes
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol § Protocol overview


== In automobiles ==
Error codes in automobiles, sometimes referred to as trouble codes, indicate to a driver or car mechanic what is wrong with a vehicle before repairs are initiated.
In vehicles with CAN buses, error codes are often five-digit codes that pinpoint a particular car fault. Car owners can make use of an on-board diagnostics scanner or an owner's manual to identify the meaning of a trouble code. Five-digit diagnostic trouble codes typically consist of one letter and four numbers (e.g. P0123).

Afzelia,"Afzelia is a genus of plants in family Fabaceae. The thirteen species all are trees, native to tropical Africa or Asia.
The genus name of Afzelia is in honour of Adam Afzelius (1750–1837), a Swedish botanist and an apostle of Carl Linnaeus.


== Evolutionary history ==
Afzelia is closely related to, and the sister taxon of Intsia. Both Afzelia and Intsia, along with Brodriguesia form the clade Afzelieae within the legume subfamily Detarioideae.
The earliest definitive record of Afzelia in the fossil record is a well-preserved, compression fossil of a leaflet (with cuticle) from the late Oligocene (27.23 Ma) Guang River flora of northwestern Ethiopia (Amhara), named Afzelia afro-arabica. Numerous other records, some which may represent Afzelia (or potentially, Intsia), are known fossil wood occurrences from the Paleogene and Neogene of Africa and Asia and are included in the form genus, Pahudioxylon.


== Species ==
12 species are accepted.

Afzelia africana Sm. ex Pers. – western tropical Africa to Uganda
Afzelia bella Harms – western and west-central tropical Africa
Afzelia bipindensis Harms – Ivory Coast and Nigeria to Uganda and Angola
Afzelia cambodensis Hance – Cambodia
Afzelia javanica (Miq.) J.Léonard – Sumatra and Java
Afzelia martabanica (Prain) J.Léonard – Myanmar
Afzelia pachyloba Harms – Nigeria to Democratic Republic of the Congo
Afzelia parviflora (Vahl) Hepper – West Africa (Liberia to Côte d'Ivoire) and Angola
Afzelia peturei De Wild. – Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia
Afzelia quanzensis Welw. – Somalia to Angola and South Africa
Afzelia rhomboidea (Blanco) Fern.-Vill. – Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Philippines
Afzelia xylocarpa (Kurz) Craib – Indo-China


== Uses ==
Afzelia species are used primarily for wood, though some species also have medicinal uses. The timber is most commonly traded under the collective name ""doussie"", as well as under name ""afzelia."" African species are sometimes traded as ""African mahogany"" or ""pod mahogany"", despite the genus being botanically unrelated to Meliaceae (mahogany.)
The seeds are red and black and are used as beads.
The wood is often used as the surface material for outdoor velodromes.
The highly figured wood of the Asian species, Afzelia xylocarpa, is sold as Afzelia xylay. The seeds and bark of this species are used as medicine.
The dense and wavy wood of an Afzelia africana is used in ship-building.

Güzel İstanbul,"Güzel İstanbul is a sculpture made of concrete, located in Yildiz Park in Istanbul, Turkey. The statue shows a naked woman and was created by an artist named Gürdal Duyar.
In 1973, the Istanbul Municipality asked artists to create 20 sculptures to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Republic. Güzel Istanbul is one of these sculptures, and it shows a naked woman to represent the city. The base of the sculpture has pictures that represent the history of Istanbul.

Originally, Güzel Istanbul was placed at Karaköy Square. But some conservative politicians and media outlets said it was offensive and wanted it taken down. In March 1974, the sculpture caused a big argument in the government. After nine days of debate, Güzel Istanbul was removed and damaged on March 18th. It was left in Karaköy Square for over a month. Eventually, on May 2nd, the statue was moved to Yildiz Park and put back up on a temporary base. It still remains in Yildiz Park today, but nobody has fixed the damage done to it.


== Commission ==
In 1972, the governor's office in Istanbul created a group called the Board for the Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Republic. The board was made to plan for the anniversary which would happen in the next year. The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, the Istanbul Fine Arts Academy, and the State College of Fine and Applied Arts worked together to make the Fine Arts Committee. This committee was part of the Board for the Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Republic. The committee included Şadi Çalık, Mustafa Aslıer, and Hüseyin Gezer. They asked 50 artists to make sculptures to celebrate the anniversary. The sculptures were put in many places around Istanbul, like parks and squares.
There was not enough money to make 50 sculptures, so the number was changed to 20. The Board also made the qualifications to be a sculptor stricter. They only picked artists who lived in Istanbul and who had either won a state award or were well-known in the art world. This meant 30 artists were not able to participate. The artists that did participate included Kuzgun Acar, Tamer Başoğlu, Zerrin Bölükbaşı, Ali Teoman Germaner, Yavuz Görey, Zühtü Müritoğlu, Füsun Onur, Kamil Sonad, Nusret Suman, Seyhun Topuz and Gürdal Duyar.
The Fine Arts Committee did not tell the artists what kind of sculpture to make, so they could create something in their own unique style. The committee wanted the sculptures to be diverse and represent the different styles of sculpture in Turkey at the time. The artists were also not told where their sculptures would be placed. They could be put in a park, a square, or on the side of a road. The artists had to submit their ideas for the sculpture they wanted to make to the State Art and Sculpture Museum by 20 August 1973.
Gürdal Duyar submitted a sketch of a nude female figure which he named ""Beautiful Istanbul"" (Güzel Istanbul in Turkish) as his proposal. The board approved his proposal during a meeting attended by local government officials, and selected Karaköy Square as the location for the sculpture. The design and nudity of the sculpture were not considered problematic at any point during the selection process.
The sculpture is also known as Ah Güzel İstanbul (""Oh Beautiful Istanbul"").


== Design ==
Gürdal Duyar's idea was to symbolize Istanbul through a sculpture of a naked woman whose arms were tied by a chain, which represented the defensive chain put up by the Byzantine Empire in 1453 to block the Ottoman fleet from entering the Golden Horn. The woman in the sculpture was trying to break free from the chains, which was supposed to represent the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, which was later renamed Istanbul. Duyar explained that he associated his hometown, Istanbul, with the natural beauty of the female form.
In Duyar's final design, the female figure is depicted leaning slightly backwards with her arms wrapped behind her, and her head inclined backwards as she gazes at the sky. Her hands are bound by a chain, which is not visible from the front. The upper part of the sculpture sits on a decorated plinth adorned with reliefs of pomegranates, figs, honeysuckle, and a bee. According to Duyar, the pomegranates represent Istanbul's many legends, figs represent its divinity, honeysuckle represents its air, and the bee represents its population density, dynamism, and abundance. Apart from its historical and political significance, Duyar's work has also been interpreted as a universal representation of women's liberation. The sculpture, which used 7,000 kilograms (15,000 lb) of poured concrete, was 4.8 meters (15.7 ft) tall when it was first installed.


== Erection and removal ==
On March 10, 1974, Güzel İstanbul was installed in Karaköy Square, which is an open and busy area located near the northern end of Galata Bridge in Istanbul. The sculpture received a lot of attention and caused controversy. According to Ahu Antmen, the controversy was caused by the sculpture's placement in a crowded area. On the other hand, Onat Kutlar believed that the controversy was due to the sensuality or realism present in Duyar's sculptures, including Güzel İstanbul.


=== Güzel İstanbul Affair ===
Before Duyar's sculpture, there were other nude sculptures displayed in public areas of Istanbul, and at that time, the Istanbul State Art and Sculpture Museum had numerous nude sculptures on display without any controversy. It has been suggested that the officials who commissioned Duyar's sculpture did not expect its nakedness to be a source of controversy. However, after the sculpture was installed in Karaköy Square, it faced immediate backlash and calls for its removal from politicians who perceived it to be indecent, particularly members of the National Salvation Party, who were part of the coalition government at the time. This sparked a public debate that was fueled by prominent Turkish political figures and covered by major media outlets, which is now known as the Güzel İstanbul Affair.
A media campaign against Güzel İstanbul started shortly after it was installed in Karaköy Square. For ten days, various newspapers described the sculpture as indecent and erotic. One newspaper, Sabah, even printed a front-page article on 21 March 1974 that accused the sculpture of corrupting the morals of Muslim Turks. This led to the sculpture becoming a topic of discussion in the government. Deputy-Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan called the sculpture immoral and suggested its removal on 17 March.  The Minister of the Interior, Oğuzhan Asiltürk, said that the sculpture was disgraceful to Turkish mothers and should be removed. The mayor of Istanbul, Ahmet İsvan, said he disliked the sculpture because he found it tasteless, not because it was a nude. The Governor of Istanbul, Namık Kemal Şentürk, stated that he could not judge the sculpture on an artistic level, but that it had been placed in the wrong location and thus had it removed.
The controversy over Güzel İstanbul led to a heated debate, with some Republican intellectuals and others defending the sculpture and arguing for its right to remain. However, the controversy also had political implications, almost leading to the collapse of Turkey's newly formed governing coalition. The CHP, the other party in the coalition, supported the National Salvation Party's position that the sculpture was indecent in order to avoid political conflict, despite this going against their own ethical values. Some scholars, such as Hüseyin Gezer, defended the sculpture, stating that there is a difference between a naked woman and a nude sculpture.


=== Removal and public backlash ===
On the night of 18 March 1974, nine days after its installation, Güzel İstanbul was removed from Karaköy Square. In a midnight intervention, the sculpture was broken off its base and damaged: its arm was broken off. It was removed from the park and placed on a pile of sand near the Kumkapı municipal construction site. The front page of the newspaper Milliyet showed a photograph of people standing on top of the empty plinth on the night the sculpture was removed, as well as the rubble resulting from the plinth's destruction. An article in the newspaper Sabah stated the goal of their campaign to have the sculpture removed had been accomplished. This was countered by articles in the newspapers Milliyet and Cumhuriyet, which described the sculpture's right to remain as a necessity for democracy.
Some Turkish intellectuals reacted to the events. Burhan Felek criticized the removal, saying a sculpture should not be removed just because a minister does not like it, and that there is not a referendum of beliefs for every issue. Melih Cevdet Anday criticized the government for choosing what the people should and should not like. Hıfzı Veldet Velidedeoğlu stated dominance of the mentality that puts forward religious conservative traditions in the context of fine arts would regress Turkey to a desert of bigotry. Güzel İstanbul was also defended by cartoonists and caricaturists such as Erdoğan Bozok, Altan Erbulak, Nejat Uygur, Yalçın Çetin, Ferruh Doğan, and Nehar Tüblek, who made cartoons commenting on its removal. One of the cartoons showed those that removed the sculpture as backwards and outdated, another criticized the politicization of art, and another criticized censorship; and others asked why fake issues were being made in the news.
Cartoonists and artists who opposed the removal wanted to protesting it by covering all sculptures in Istanbul in black cloth but they cancelled their protest. The removal from Karaköy Square was seen as being against freedom of expression in art; to protest this, the Association of Turkish Sculptors organized an exhibition around the theme of nudity to show that the creative will of artists would continue. Many sculptors participated in the show, including Füsun Onur.
The debate about Güzel İstanbul spread beyond Istanbul; provinces Manisa and Zonguldak offered to have Güzel İstanbul moved to their cities. Güzel İstanbul was one of 20 sculptures of which many others were damaged or removed.


=== Charges ===
On 20 March 1974, the Istanbul Public Prosecutors Office, considering the articles published about the sculpture in newspapers as charges, opened an inquiry to decide whether the sculpture was obscene. According to a news report, if the sculpture was found to be obscene, the 50th Anniversary Committee would face prosecution under articles 426 and 576 of Turkish law. Mustafa Aslıer, a member of the committee, reflected on the events that led to the removal of Güzel İstanbul; he had been implicated in the statements and publications by the press and the MSP that led to the charges.


== Relocation ==
On 3 May 1974, through the secret intervention of Bülent Ecevit, Güzel İstanbul was taken to Yıldız Park and left lying on its side underneath a tree. The move ended the heated political and public debate regarding the sculpture which had lasted almost two months, although Güzel İstanbul was left in an poor physical condition. In the subsequent months, photographs of the sculpture lying on its side in the park appeared; several newspapers published opinion pieces — including articles by Burhan Felek and Bedi Faik — describing the sculpture being left in this state and asking why the process was disrespectful to the artwork and the artist. The statue was eventually mounted onto a new makeshift plinth without the motifs, all of which had been destroyed. As of 2021, the sculpture stands in a small corner near the park's Ortaköy entrance. According to some press accounts, it has not been well maintained; parts of its concrete are crumbling and its inner structure is exposed.


== Later events ==
Gürdal Duyar, the sculptor of Güzel Istanbul, said little about the statue's fate and did not participate in the controversy. In 1995, Turkish journalist Nebil Özgentürk asked Duyar about the repeated removals of the artist's work. Duyar said his role as the artist was limited to creation of sculptures, adding: ""Our job is making sculptures; removing, breaking or changing their location is a different area of expertise"".
In 2017, the Istanbul Municipality hid the sculpture by surrounding it with a fence made of saplings after parents had complained about it being visible from a nearby playground. After news of this censorship spread, a campaign on social media criticized the censorship and succeeded in having the saplings removed.

Technical drawing,"Technical drawing, also known as drafting or draughting, is the act and discipline of making detailed drawings. These drawings visually communicate how something works or how it is to be made.


== Communicating ideas ==
Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering. 
To make  drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols. They use standard units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layouts. These drawing conventions are internationally accepted standards. Technical drawings are a universal way of communicating complex mechanical concepts. Technical drawing are very different from the expressive drawing of the visual arts. Artistic drawings may have many meanings. Technical drawings are understood to have one intended meaning.
Technical drawings are used to make electronic parts as well as mechanical parts. They are used in commercial and residential construction. Roads, bridges, and wastewater systems are just some of the things that need technical drawings. Almost anything that is manufactured requires technical drawings.  


== Technicians ==
A drafter, draftsperson, or draughtsman is a person trained to make technical drawings. A professional drafter who makes technical drawings is sometimes called a drafting technician. Professional draftspersons bridge the gap between engineers and manufacturers. They contribute experience and technical expertise to the design process.

Lydia Puccinelli,"Lydia Puccinelli (born Lydia Marie Puccinelli-Robbins; December 7, 1930 – December 27, 2023) was an American exhibition designer, curatorial assistant, registrar, curator of exhibitions and of collections.


== Early life and education ==
Born on December 7, 1930, Lydia Puccinelli was became interested in art in her early life. She briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University, but, discovering art's creative and expressive capabilities, she then attended the Cooper Union School of Art majoring painting and graduated in 1959. She was later accepted by Yale University, while also studying painting at the Aspen School of Art in Colorado. Interested in textiles, she also studied textile design and designed textiles for large American textile firms.


== Career ==


==== The African Art Museum ====
In 1966, Puccinelli was told that she was suitable for a position at a new museum on Capitol Hill, then known as the African Art Museum. There she met her husband Warren M. Robbins, also the founder of the African Art Museum. After she joined, Puccinelli was gradually promoted from Designer to Curator of Exhibitions. The African Art Museum initially consisted of Warren Robbins' personal collections, which include artworks from different African tribes such as Mali, Kongo, and Dogon. Later, Robbins' collections would grow to 9100 pieces, all of which were managed by Puccinelli and Robbins.In 1979, when the museum was merged into the Smithsonian, Puccinelli was promoted to Curator and directed over 75 exhibitions and 3 catalogues.

Design for inspection,"Design for inspection (DFI) is an engineering principle that proposes that inspection methods and measurement instruments used to certify manufacturing conformity, should be considered early in the design of products. Production processes should be designed in such a way that features of the product are easy to inspect with readily available measurement instruments, and so that measurement uncertainty is considered in the tolerance that are applied. The concept can be applied in almost all engineering disciplines. DFI describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the measurement in order to reduce the overall costs of manufacturing and delivering products that satisfy customers.
The role of inspection in the manufacturing process is to ensure that the manufacturing process is producing components that meet the specification requirements. Inspection does not assure the quality of the product, only a robust and repeatable manufacturing process can achieve this. Therefore, inspection is often considered as an overhead although an extremely important one. Similar to design for manufacture (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA) (which seek to avoid designs which are difficult to make), the concept of DFI considers measurement capabilities at an early stage in the product development life cycle and uses knowledge of the fundamental principles of metrology to achieve cost reduction. If the inspection method and instruments are considered and selected at the design stage, the likelihood that a tolerance feature cannot be inspected or requires a specialised instrument is substantially reduced. High precision features require specialised manufacturing and metrology, these can have limited availability in the supply chain and therefore often have increased cost. The concept of DFI should complement and work in collaboration with DFM and DFA. There are three key areas when considering DFI, datum selection, tolerances and accessibility, plus general metrology considerations. Getting the most from inspection techniques will help improve quality. It is still difficult for systems designers to build machines that allow finished products to be inspected easily. To do so requires an understanding of the product being manufactured and how inspection tasks can improve the quality control process.
Inspection can represent a significant percentage of an existing product's manufacturing cost. DFI may naturally be called for in redesign of a product to reduce that cost component when it is high. However, DFI will not always reduce inspection costs: it can also lead to increased rate of inspection, because more convenient or higher quality measurement may justify increasing measurements, say from a sampling rate satisfactory to support a basic level of tolerance to a higher rate (e.g. to 100%). Or DFI may make it economical for 100% inspections to measure more features or to make repeated measures of the same feature at different points within the manufacturing process. This would be justified if it would reduce internal failure costs (such as costs of rework or scrap) or external failure costs (such as customer returns) within the cost of quality framework.

Intersex,"Intersex variations occur (though rarely) in species which use sexual reproduction. Intersex people are born with sex characteristics that lie between those of typical males and typical females. Hermaphrodite is a term that gets confused with intersexual, and while all hermaphrodites are intersexual, not all intersexual people are hermaphrodites. The clinical term 'disorders of sex development' (DSD) is very controversial.
An intersex individual's genitalia may be atypical in some way. It can be difficult to determine if an intersex baby is genetically male or female (with XY chromosomes or XX chromosomes). They may also have male and/or female secondary sex characteristics (such as body shape). However, there is a wide range of variation in sexual anatomy. There are many more subtle forms of sex anatomy, or sex chromosome differences. These don't even show physically. Some won't show up until later in life. Sometimes, the variation may appear when the baby reaches puberty or becomes an adult. It may not even be detected in an individual's lifetime, but as technology gets more advanced, that chance dims down.


== Population figures ==
Up to 0.018% of people may be born with an intersex variation.


== Causes ==
Most causes of intersex are congenital, or born with it, usually because of a genetic condition. All development is governed by genes which regulate the process of growth.
The most common intersex variation is a hormone condition. This causes genetically female fetuses to have a more masculine body appearance, because the babies' adrenal gland produces higher levels of androgen hormones (hormones that act like testosterone). This may cause the female baby to appear male even to doctors and parents.


== Genetic Abnormalities ==
Some intersex people may be so because of abnormalities with their sex chromosomes, resulting in genetic disorders. One disorder known as Turner's Syndrome, is when instead of having an XX (female) or XY (male) genotype, a person has X0. A person with Turner's Syndrome usually looks like a girl, but they are shorter in height and do not go through puberty, meaning they cannot reproduce.
Another genetic disorder is Klinefelter Syndrome, where a person has an XXY genotype. This disorder affects men, causing infertility, smaller genitalia, and less facial hair. Men with this disorder can have a variety of symptoms which can be so unnoticeable that they may never be diagnosed.


== Medical interventions ==
Surgery may be used on intersex babies to give a more usual cosmetic appearance. This is sometimes thought to make children more normal, but this idea lacks evidence and is contested. Early cosmetic medical interventions can lead to problems in later life, including decreased sexual function and sensation. The children concerned cannot consent to those surgeries, and their parents may not understand the full implications. There is no medical consensus about surgical interventions, including their type, timing, necessity and conduct.
Medical interventions can cause mental and emotional harm to the child when it grows and begins to go through puberty. Children may not feel like they are the gender that is assigned to them by their parents or doctors, causing issues with gender identity. Some people believe it is best to leave the genitalia as it is when the child is born and allow them to make decisions about it when they are old enough.


== Human rights ==
Civil society organizations and human rights experts including authors of the Yogyakarta Principles have called for an end to medical interventions on intersex children that are carried out for social reasons. United Nations and other human rights experts regard these medical treatments as harmful.
In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to win a legal case taken because of non-consensual surgical intervention. In April 2015, Malta became the first country to end medical interventions to modify the sex anatomy of intersex children.
Several countries protect intersex people from discrimination, including South Africa, Australia, and Malta.


== Activism ==
As intersexuality becomes more recognized all over the world, there are many activist groups created to promote recognizing and supporting members of this community. One major activist group known as the Intersex Society of North America, or INSA, teaches people what intersexuality is and the harms of children having gender assignment surgery without their permission to consent.
One of the major issues intersex people face is other people who are not intersex making them feel uncomfortable about their sex and gender. Intersex people may not feel the need to identify themselves at all in their lifetimes, preferring to maintain ambiguity. However, those who are not a part of this community feel as though people need to chose and be more clear about their genitalia. This invasion of privacy is often protested against and discussed by activist groups who believe intersex people are allowed to be private and deserve to be treated the same as those who are not intersex.

Deism,"Deism is the belief that a higher being (like God) exists but that the only revelation of God is in nature and reason, not in sacred books or prophets. Deism says that people should rely on logic and reason and not traditions of a religion based on a holy book. People who follow deism are called deists.
Deists believe that a higher power created the world. They may not believe that the creation of the universe happened because of a spontaneous event. They usually reject supernatural events like miracles and believe that God has set up natural laws that govern how the universe works and how people should act that and God does not interfere with those laws. Most deists also see holy scriptures, such as the Bible and Qur'an, as writings by people, rather than by God.
Famous deists from history include the American political leader and inventor Benjamin Franklin, French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, the French philosopher Voltaire, the British philosopher Thomas Paine, and the French revolutionary leader Maximilien de Robespierre. Many historians think that US President Thomas Jefferson was a deist though he failed to say so.

Release notes,"Release notes are documents that are distributed with software products or hardware products, sometimes when the product is still in the development or test state (e.g., a beta release). For products that have already been in use by clients, the release note is delivered to the customer when an update is released. Another abbreviation for Release notes is Changelog or Release logs or Software changes or Revision history Updates or README file. However, in some cases, the release notes and changelog are published separately. This split is for clarity and differentiation of feature-highlights from bugs, change requests (CRs) or improvements on the other side.


== Purpose ==
Release Notes are documents that are shared with end users, customers and clients of an organization. The definition of the terms 'End Users', 'Clients' and 'Customers' are very relative in nature and might have various interpretations based on the specific context. For instance, the Quality Assurance group within a software development organization can be interpreted as an internal customer.


== Content ==
Release notes detail the corrections, changes or enhancements (functional or non-functional) made to the service or product the company provides.
They might also be provided as an artifact accompanying the deliverables for System Testing and System Integration Testing and other managed environments especially with reference to an information technology organization.
Release notes can also contain test results and information about the test procedure. This kind of information gives readers of the release note more confidence in the fix/change done; this information also enables implementer of the change to conduct rudimentary acceptance tests.
They differ from End-user license agreement, since they do not (should not) contain any legal terms of the software product or service. The focus should be on the software release itself, not for example legal conditions.
Release notes can also be interpreted as describing how to install or build the software, instead of highlighting new features or resolved bugs. Another term often used in this context is System Requirements, meaning the required hardware and software for installing or building the software.


== Format style ==
There is no standard format for release notes that is followed throughout different organizations. Organizations normally adopt their own formatting styles based on the requirement and type of the information to be circulated. The content of release notes also vary according to the release type. For products that are at testing stage and that are newly released, the content is usually more descriptive compared to release notes for bug fixes and feature enhancements, which are usually brief.
Release notes may include the following sections:

Header – Document name (i.e. release notes), product name, release number, release date, note date, note version, etc.
Overview - A brief overview of the product and changes, in the absence of other formal documentation.
Purpose - A brief overview of the purpose of the release note with a listing of what is new in this release, including bug fixes and new features.
Issue summary - A short description of the bug or the enhancement in the release.
Steps to reproduce - The steps that were followed when the bug was encountered.
Resolution - A short description of the modification/enhancement that was made to fix the bug.
End-user impact - What different actions are needed by the end-users of the application.  This should include whether other functionality is impacted by these changes.
Support impacts - Changes required in the daily process of administering the software.
Notes - Notes about software or hardware installation, upgrades and product documentation (including documentation updates)
Disclaimers - Company and standard product related messages. e.g.; freeware, anti-piracy, duplication etc.. See also disclaimer.

A release note is usually a terse summary of recent changes, enhancements and bug fixes in a particular software release. It is not a substitute for user guides. Release notes are frequently written in the present tense and provide information that is clear, correct, and complete.
A proposal for an open-specification exists and is called Release Notes Schema Specification.

Software as a service,"Software as a service is the idea that clients access and use software using a thin client or a web browser. SaaS is also known as on-demand software, web-based software, or web-hosted software.  The software itself is running on computers accessible through the Internet (""in the cloud""). Clients usually pay a fee to get access to the software. The benefit of this approach is that clients do not need to manage the software installation, and that they also do not need expensive hardware. Software providers do not need to use traditional methods of supply, such as distributors, to sell software to clients. One of the problems is that the data is also on the site of the company running the software - that is  ""in the cloud"". Getting the data may be difficult, if the software vendor goes bankrupt. Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation considers SaaS as a violation of the principles of free software, because users have no access to the program that runs the software, and hence do not know what it does, and cannot change it.

UNESCO World Engineering Day for Sustainable Development,"The World Engineering Day for Sustainable Development (acronym: WED) is one of the UNESCO international days and is celebrated every 4 March. It was proclaimed by UNESCO General Conference on 25 November 2019, based on a proposal by the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO).

It is celebrated by major engineering professional institutions, such as the Institution of Civil Engineers, the China Association for Science and Technology, Engineers Canada, Engineers Australia, Ingénieurs et scientifiques de France,  as well as NGOs such as DiscoverE, Engineers Without Borders, universities such as Imperial College London or Technische Hochschule Georg Agricola and corporations supporting the event.
The first edition of WED in 2019, as well as the following ones, were based on the concept of holding simultaneous online and on-site celebrations, hosted by UNESCO, WFEO, engineering institutions members of WFEO, as well as generating social media trends and message on the theme of event, engaging with UN agencies such as UNEP, corporate bodies, other associations, media and students.
In 2022, the concept extended to a 24-hour streaming hosted by WFEO, live streaming featured celebrations in various regions of the world.
Since 2022, the celebration includes global events such as an international hackathon competition for engineering students in relations to sustainable development matters.

Flame test,"A flame test is relatively quick test for the presence of some elements in a sample.  The technique is archaic and of questionable reliability, but once was a component of qualitative inorganic analysis. The phenomenon is related to pyrotechnics and atomic emission spectroscopy.  The color of the flames is understood through the principles of atomic electron transition and photoemission, where varying elements require distinct energy levels (photons) for electron transitions. 


== History ==

Robert Bunsen invented the now-famous Bunsen burner in 1855, which was useful in flame tests due to its non-luminous flame that did not disrupt the colors emitted by the test materials. The Bunsen burner, combined with a prism (filtering the color interference of contaminants), led to the creation of the spectroscope, capable of emitting the spectral emission of various elements. In 1860, the unexpected appearance of sky-blue and dark red was observed in spectral emissions by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, leading to the discovery of two alkali metals, caesium (sky-blue) and rubidium (dark red). Today, this low-cost method is used in secondary education to teach students to detect metals in samples qualitatively.


== Process ==

A flame test involves introducing a sample of the element or compound to a hot, non-luminous flame and observing the color of the flame that results.  The compound can be made into a paste with concentrated hydrochloric acid, as metal halides, being volatile, give better results. Different flames can be tried to verify the accuracy of the color. Wooden splints, Nichrome wires, platinum wires, magnesia rods, cotton swabs, and melamine foam are suggested for support. Safety precautions are crucial due to the flammability and toxicity of some substances involved. When using a splint, one must be careful to wave the splint through the flame rather than holding it in the flame for extended periods, to avoid setting the splint itself on fire. The use of a cotton swab or melamine foam (used in “eraser” cleaning sponges) as a support has also been suggested.  Sodium is a common component or contaminant in many samples, and its spectrum tends to dominate many flame tests others. The test flame is often viewed through cobalt blue glass to filter out the yellow of sodium and allow for easier viewing of other metal ions.
The color of the flames also generally depends on temperature and oxygen fed; see flame colors. The procedure uses different solvents and flames to view the test flame through a cobalt blue glass or didymium glass to filter the interfering light of contaminants such as sodium.
Flame tests are subject of a number of limitations. The range of elements positively detectable under standard conditions is small. Some elements emit weakly and others (Na) very strongly. Gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and a number of other elements do not produce a characteristic flame color, although some may produce sparks (as do metallic titanium and iron); salts of beryllium and gold reportedly deposit pure metal on cooling. The test is highly subjective.


== Principle ==

In flame tests, ions are excited thermally.  These excited states then relax to the ground state with emission of a photon.  The energy of the excited state(s) and associated emitted photon is characteristic of the element.  The nature of the excited and ground states depends only on the element. Ordinarily, there are no bonds to be broken, and molecular orbital theory is not applicable.  The emission spectrum observed in flame test is also the basis of  flame emission spectroscopy, atomic emission spectroscopy, and flame photometry.

Benign,"The word benign is often used to refer to a medical condition that will not become life-threatening if it is not treated, but can also mean that something is not harmful.  It is often used in relation to tumours that do not metastasise to other parts of the body.  Tumours that are referred to as being benign may still be life-threatening because of other reasons.  Because of this, the term applies mainly to their biological behaviour.
Tumors that are benign may be at risk of changing into malignancy.  These are termed ""premalignant"".",0
Safer end of engineering life,"Safer End of Engineering Life, sometimes abbreviated to SEEL, is a concept that focuses on the importance of considering the entire lifecycle of a product or system. Currently there is a lot of focus on the decommissioning or retirement in particular industries. This includes but is not limited to plastic waste, electronic waste (sometimes shorted to e-waste), and construction and industrial waste.
Recently, SEEL is becoming more of a focus in fields such as software engineering, industrial design, and infrastructure development.


== Background ==
The idea behind SEEL is to mitigate risks and ensure safety not only during the active use phase of a product but also during its end-of-life processes, such as disposal, recycling, or decommissioning. This approach recognises that even after a product has served its intended purpose, it can still pose risks to the environment, public health, or safety if not managed properly.
In software engineering, SEEL may involve designing systems with built-in mechanisms for secure data deletion, ensuring that sensitive information is properly erased when software or hardware reaches the end of its useful life. It could also involve planning for software updates and patches to be maintained and deployed until the end-of-life date to address any security vulnerabilities that may arise over time.
In industrial design and manufacturing, SEEL may include considerations for recyclability, ease of disassembly, and the use of environmentally friendly materials. By designing products with end-of-life considerations in mind, manufacturers can facilitate the recycling or repurposing of components, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact.


== Recent milestones ==
The Royal Academy of Engineering launched a global review in January 2021 into the further study of SEEL, as well as the impacts the lack of action was having, with potential goals and aims in the future.
An international workshop was held online in May 2022 with experts from 15 countries. The workshop aimed to reflect on the progress related to the safety challenges on how to ensure the global fleet of 50,000 ships and 10,000 offshore structures can be decommissioned in an environmentally friendly way. During the same year, the European Union also published a report into findings on offshore decommissioning.
The Lowy Institute also published reports into the dangers of how reliant the oil and gas industries were on aging infrastructure.


== Application & challenges ==
A main focus in recent years has been the decommissioning of offshore structures and ships. Oil rigs as one example  have a complex decommissioning process. Even after decommissioning, there may still be infrastructure remaining on the seafloor, such as well casings or pipelines. Decommissioning oil rigs presents numerous challenges due to technical complexity, environmental concerns, regulatory compliance, cost, legacy infrastructure, and stakeholder interests. These structures are intricate and contain various components, which requires specialised knowledge. Removal of hazardous materials can also be difficult and costly.

Beskidenverein,"Beskidenverein, Beskiden-Verein, Beskiden Verein was a German tourist association founded in 1893. It was the first organization operating in the Beskids region, which at that time belonged to Austria-Hungary and currently belongs to Poland; the Polish Tatra Association was founded in 1873 but initially limited its activities to the Tatra Mountains and the Beskid ranges located in present-day Ukraine, while the Czech Pohorská jednota ""Radhošť"" was active in the Beskids currently belonging to the Czech Republic.
Beskidenverein conducted extensive activities to promote mass tourism and was a pioneer of Beskid tourism in many fields. It operated officially until 1945.


== Beginnings and activities until 1918 ==

The second half of the 19th century marked the creation of the first tourist and mountain organizations across Europe. In Austrian Silesia, the first branches of the German Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association (German: Mährisch-Schlesischer Sudetengebirgsverein, MSSGV) were established – a section in Opava (1882), followed by one in Vitkovice (now a district of Ostrava – 1884). In 1884, the Czech Pohorská jednota ""Radhošť"" was founded in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm. Already then, there were voices calling for the creation of a German tourist organization operating solely in the Beskids – active proponents of this were Karl Richter, a politician and lawyer, and teacher Johann Hadaszczok, both from Moravian Ostrava. Their dreams came true on 28 February 1893 – Beskidenverein was founded in Frýdek-Místek. It was modeled after the Austrian (and later all-German) organization Austrian Alpine Club. The headquarters were initially planned for Frýdek-Místek but were eventually established in Moravian Ostrava and later moved to Cieszyn. Karl Richter became the first chairman. At the turn of the century, the most active members were high school professors from Moravian Ostrava (Josef Matzura), Cieszyn (Alois Steiner), and Bielsko (Karl Kolbenheyer).
Beskidenverein was organized into independent sections, covering the entire area of interest. Its members were Germans living in large numbers in the Austrian Silesia of the time and in northern Moravia. The goal was to develop the areas from Lysá hora in the west to Babia Góra in the east of the Beskids for tourist purposes: to facilitate the practical realization of goals (...) through trail marking and road improvement, through the construction and operation of mountain support points – facilitating movement in the Beskids and increasing the desire for hiking (quote from Beskidenverein's statute from 1893).
The main sources of funding (besides membership fees) included financial support from German landowners, the German bourgeoisie, and industrialists. The association was also materially and politically supported by the Cieszyn princes from the Habsburg line – Archduke Albrecht, and after his death in 1895, Archduke Friedrich.
Among the tourists visiting the Silesian Beskids at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, numbering tens of thousands annually, about 90% were Germans, with the remaining mainly being Czechs. The number of Poles hiking the mountain trails was estimated to be only 1%. Beskidenverein was an organization of Germans, and most of its activities were conducted through the prism of the interests of this national group. For this reason, conflicts arose with similar Czech and Polish organizations, which intensified during the interwar period, under changed political and economic conditions.


=== Organizational division before World War I ===
In 1909, the association already had 13 sections – the strongest in Bielsko (and Biała – Sektion Bielitz-Biala, also Beskiden Bielitz-Biala Verein), Cieszyn, and Vítkovice. The territorial division looked as follows: Austrian Silesia – Bielsko, Cieszyn, Frýdek-Místek, Bílovec (since 1901), Bohumín (since 1909); Moravia – Moravian Ostrava, Místek, Vítkovice, Frýdlant nad Ostravicí, Nový Jičín; German Upper Silesia: Racibórz (since 1897), Katowice (since 1898), Bytom (since 1906), and Mysłowice (since 1907). World War I did not slow down the development of Beskidenverein – in 1915, the number of sections increased to 18; additional sections came from Germany – Pszczyna, Rybnik, Chorzów, and even a distant section from Wrocław.
The most active was the Bielsko section – already in the year of its establishment, it had 432 members (in 1909 – 1210) and marked trails to Szyndzielnia, Klimczok, and Błatnia. At the turn of the century, it was led by Paul Niepen and Robert Meinhardt.
The general meetings of Beskidenverein were held each time in the headquarters of a different section, which participated in the deliberations through their delegates.


=== Number of Beskidenverein members from 1893 to 1909 ===
1893 – 1534
1895 – 1814
1900 – 2835
1905 – 3238
1909 – 4618
In 1915, the number of association members exceeded 5,000. The majority of them (about 40%) came from the German Empire, slightly fewer from Austrian Silesia, and about 25% from Moravia.


=== Trail blazing activities in the Beskids ===
The association marked and established hiking trails. In the year of Beskidenverein's establishment, it marked the first trails in the Beskids – around Klimczok, Magura, and Błatnia. However, it is not known in what form and which routes were marked; the first detailed description of trails concerns the areas around Babia Góra. In August 1894, Wilhelm Schlesinger (a member of the Bielsko Beskidenverein), Lajos Klein (a postmaster from Oravská Polhora), and two other activists marked the Slaná Voda trail (from the Słona woda spa in Oravská Polhora) – Polana Hucisko–Gajówka Hviezdoslava–Głodna Woda–Diablak. The color of the trail was red. On 11 June 1895, after obtaining permission from the Directorate of Żywiec Estates (the area belonged to Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria), Schlesinger, along with a team, marked the first precisely described trail in the Polish Beskids on the route Zawoja–Gruba Jodła–Markowe Szczawiny–Dejakowe Szczawiny–Stary Groń–Widły. The first Polish trail appeared in this area (and also in the entire Western Beskids) only in 1906. The signposts displayed only in the German language; they directed, among others, to Brana (Cyl), Branasattel (Brona pass), and Teufelspitze (Diablak).
By 1908, Beskidenverein had already established 300 km of trails, and the marking system – a colored strip between two white ones (established in 1897 and formally approved in 1899) – was later adopted in many countries, and it was also used by the Polish Tatra Association.


=== Publishing activities ===
Beskidenverein was a pioneer in many fields in the Beskids, and its publishing activity was extremely important. It published numerous maps, the first mountain guides, jubilee books, reports, and periodicals (including Mitteilungen des Beskidenvereines, from 1904 to 1915, first in Bielsko, then in Cieszyn; the bulletin was published 6 times a year, initially with a circulation of 4,000 copies, later increased to 5,200 copies).
The strongest Bielsko section began publishing its own yearbooks (Jahresbericht der Sektion Bielitz-Biala des Beskiden-Vereines) in the year of the organization's and section's founding – 1893. Initially, they were modest, several-page brochures in a reporting form. From 1900 onwards, the name was changed to Jahresbericht der Sektion Bielitz-Biala des Beskiden-Vereines and the volume was increased. Feuilletons and more ambitious texts began to appear. The yearbook was published until 1911, then there was a long break until the interwar period. In 1927, a report was issued for the years 1912–1925, as well as in 1928 for the years 1926–1927. Subsequent issues were irregularly published in the form of a short brochure. The last one was published in 1943 as a report for the previous year. At that time, the section also prepared a jubilee publication on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of its activity – as it turned out, this was the last aspect of Beskidenverein's publishing activity.
The Bielsko section also had a significant role in preparing tourist maps and guides. The most important publications include:

Führer durch die Beskiden im Gebiete der Section Bielitz-Biala des Beskiden-Vereines – 1891, by Karl Kolbenheyer,
Illustrirter Führer durch die Beskiden und die agrenzenden Landschaften – 1891, by Josef Matzura,
Führer durch Bielitz-Biala und Umgebung – 1912,
Spezialkarte des schles.-gal. Beskiden – by Wilhelm Schlesinger.
Among other sections, the Frýdek-Místek section was also active in publishing. The most important publication was the guide Führer durch die Beskiden by Johann Hadaszczok, reissued several times.
The Bielsko section established a library where it collected a collection of books related to the mountains. In 1903, it contained 55 volumes.


=== Beskidenverein's mountain huts ===

Beskidenverein promoted both mountain tourism and skiing, but above all, it built the first true mountain huts in the Beskids (lodging facilities already existed in the mountains before, but they were not typical tourist shelters – they were used by aristocrats and hunting clubs, not tourists). Before World War I, they were opened in the following locations:

Jaworowy (Jaworowy, Gross Jaworowy) – April 1895; it was built by the Cieszyn section. It was the first true mountain hut in the Beskids (Erzherzog–Friedrich–Schutzhaus in honor of Archduke Friedrich of the Cieszyn line of the Habsburgs), very popular among tourists (already eight days after opening, the thousandth guest arrived, and on average, 6,000 people visited the facility within a year);
Lysá hora (Lysa–Berg, Kahlberg) – 1895, created by the joint efforts of five sections under the name Erzherzog–Albrecht–Schutzhaus. The patron was Archduke Albrecht, who died that year. In 1908, on the trail leading to the summit, the Ostrauer Hütte was opened as a resting place for less experienced tourists. The facility on the summit was managed by the Main Board of Beskidenverein, while Ostrauer Hütte was managed by the Moravian Ostrava section;
Szyndzielnia (Kamitzerplatte) – 1897. It was the first mountain hut (Schutzhaus auf dem Kamitzerplatte) in the Beskids that currently belong to Poland, still existing after expansion. In 1907, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the shelter's establishment, a wooden cottage in Swiss style was added, intended as an additional shelter. The land under the shelter became the property of the association only in 1940, after a long lease period. It was managed by the Bielsko section. In 1906, next to the hut, a botanical garden (alpine garden) called the Beskidy Garden was established – it covered about 400 m2 and had 350 plants of 120 species. The idea was proposed by Dr. Eduard Schnack, a Beskidenverein member, museum curator, and naturalist. The garden exists to this day;
Bílý Kříž (Weisses Kreuz) in the range of Malý Polom – in 1897, the inn and hut Beskidenheim were leased from a Czech owner; in its place, in 1902, the Vitkovice section opened a new, larger hut Schutzhütte Weisse Kreuz. In 1907, a summer villa called Josefinenheim was made available to tourists, named after the wife of a great friend and donor of Beskidenverein, Friedrich Schuster;
Slavíč – 1898 or 1899; a small mountain hut (Hadaszczok–Hütte) dedicated to the memory of Johann Hadaszczok, the second president of Beskidenverein, who died in 1895 shortly after a mountain hike (he had serious health problems). Managed by the Vitkovice section;
Magurka (Josefsberg) – 1903, burned twice, in 1907 and 1912, rebuilt twice under the name Erzherzogin Maria Theresia – Schutzhaus auf dem Josefsberg. It exists to this day;
Czantoria Wielka (Großer Czantory-Berg) – 1904 as Erzherzogin Isabella – Schutzhaus auf dem Großer Czantory-Berg (the patron was Isabella von Croy-Dülmen, wife of Archduke Friedrich, the then Duke of Cieszyn). Built and managed by the Cieszyn section. It exists to this day;
Babia Góra (Teufelspitze) – built in 1905 as Schlesinger-Schutzhaus (named after Wilhelm Schlesinger, who contributed greatly to the Beskid Association). Until the 1930s, it was the highest located mountain hut in the Carpathians. It was located in Hungary, and after the border regulation in Orava in 1920, it became part of Poland. In 1933, the State Forest Directorate from Lviv contested Beskidenverein's right to the land on which the hut stood, and after a court case, it was taken over by Germans in 1938 (actually, in 1936, it was transferred to the State Forest Cooperative ""Leśnik"" from Lviv). Until 1939, it functioned as a Polish shelter, popularly called Leśnik. Currently, it no longer exists – deprived of a caretaker in 1948, it was destroyed by a fire, and the ruins were demolished to the foundations in 1980. Since 1905, there was also a guestbook with an appeal in three languages – German, Hungarian, and Polish. Earlier, in 1904, Beskidenverein installed a box with a memorial book for tourists at the top of Babia Góra, according to which an average of about 400 people visited the summit at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At Klimczok, in the years 1894–1895, at the initiative of the association, the existing wooden hut from 1872, which mainly served hunters (called Klementinenhütte after the name of the owner of these lands – Klementyna von Primavesi), was expanded. Unfortunately, the building was destroyed by fire three times (in 1895 during the opening after the expansion, in 1910, and in 1913). Consequently, with the support of Beskidenverein, a new stone hut was built in 1914, which has survived to the present day.
All mentioned huts had restaurants, and accommodation was possible in separate rooms for ""ladies"" and ""gentlemen"". At the beginning of the 20th century, accommodation cost 1.60 krones, while a mattress cost 60 halerzys. With the exception of Hadaszczok–Hütte, the facilities were open all year round.
In 1894, on the slopes of Dębowiec (Seniorberg), in the former hunting lodge of the Sułkowski princes, the association opened a tavern (Baumgärtel). However, this was not a typical mountain hut, and in the early years, it mainly served as a resting place for tourists heading from Bielsko to Szyndzielnia. Only later did it begin to offer accommodation. It still exists and serves tourists as a gastronomic facility.
A wooden shelter was also built on Romanka (known as Ski-hütte), intended for skiers, but it was destroyed during World War I by highlanders.
Already in this period, conflicts arose between the association and Polish and Czech organizations. Germans mainly used the German language on their signs, markings, and in huts (it was mandatory for Beskidenverein members); however, there were also Hungarian inscriptions on Babia Góra, and sporadically Polish and Czech ones. Poles and Czechs demanded bilingual names, to which Germans did not agree, arguing that German-speaking tourists constituted a significant majority on the trails.


=== Organization of leisure activities for children ===
Similarly to other German tourist organizations, Beskidenverein also decided to organize summer camps for children as a way to promote active tourism from a young age. The section from Moravian Ostrava started sending children to Jablunkov in 1901, and from 1903 to Poruba. In 1908, they transferred the organization of the summer camps to an independent association called Fereinheim.
In addition to organizing summer camps, Beskidenverein initiated charitable actions towards local poor German or highlander children at the end of the 19th century. Clothing, footwear, and sweets were distributed during these initiatives.


=== Popularization of skiing ===
In 1907, the Bielsko section established the Winter Sports Club (Wintersportclub Bielitz-Biala des Beskidensvereines), which promoted winter sports, mainly skiing, among Silesian and Lesser Poland Germans. After World War I, it participated in the founding of the Polish Ski Association. The best skier from the Winter Sports Club, Teodor Winschenk (Weinschenck), became a three-time Polish champion during the interwar period and represented Poland in alpine skiing events at the 1936 Winter Olympics. This section quickly separated from the parent organization, and its history followed a separate path.
In January 1906, before the establishment of the Winter Sports Club, six skiers from Zabrze, belonging to Beskidenverein, were the first to reach the summit of Diablak. They started their route in Jeleśnia, braving difficult weather conditions, then headed to Jałowiecka pass, and after conquering the ""Queen of the Beskids"", they spent the night in the hut under Babia Góra (which was normally closed in winter at that time).
The first skiing competitions under the patronage of Beskidenverein took place in 1907 on the slopes of Lysá hora, with 32 participants. It was for the needs of skiers, among others, that Ostrauer Hütte was built, as well as ski shelters on Romanka (in 1912) and Skrzyczne (in 1924).
Frequent competitions and training courses were also organized on the sub-peak clearings of Magurka.


=== Cooperation with other tourist associations ===

The authorities of Beskidenverein were aware that cooperation between mountain associations would be crucial for promoting tourism. Within the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, there were many similar organizations, mainly German, focusing their activities on various mountain ranges.
In 1895, an exhibition was organized in Cieszyn, which illustrated the past activities of Beskidenverein and emphasized the beauty of the Beskids. Associations from other mountain ranges were also invited to participate.
In 1899, the Bielsko section of Beskidenverein proposed an exchange of discounts to the Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association. Its members were to receive discounts at the shelter on Szyndzielnia, administered by the Bielsko section, in exchange for discounts at Sudeten shelters. The Main Board of Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association initially accepted the proposal favorably but ultimately rejected it, resolving that the exchange of discounts could only occur between associations, not with a single section.
It wasn't until 1902 that Beskidenverein entered into a multilateral agreement for cooperation and discount exchange. Besides Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association, numerous sections from the German and Austrian Alpine Club (Deutscher und Oesterreichischer Alpenverein, DuÖAV), the German Tourist Association from Brno (Verein deutscher Touristen in Brünn), and several other smaller organizations signed the agreement (totaling over 50 sections and over 100 shelters). The agreement was terminated in 1906 due to financial reasons; it was not advantageous for the alpine associations whose members rarely visited the Beskids or the Sudetes. In 1913, Beskidenverein members regained discounts at Moravian-Silesian Sudeten Mountain Association huts, and from 1914, Beskidenverein huts applied the same discounts to members of the Moravian-Silesian association.


== Division of the Beskidenverein after World War I ==
The activities of the Beskidenverein continued after World War I. Silesia, which had previously belonged to the Habsburg monarchy, was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia, while the former Prussian Silesia was divided between Poland and the Weimar Republic. The fate of individual sections of the Beskidenverein, which found themselves on different sides of the border, began to diverge, depending on the country they were in. In practice, two separate organizations (Polish and Czechoslovak) emerged, which, however, cooperated with each other.


== Activities of the Beskidenverein in independent Poland ==
The Polish Beskidenverein actively competed with Polish tourist organizations, as evidenced by the ""paintbrush war"" on the slopes of Babia Góra, which dates back to the first decade of the 20th century. Initially, the contacts between these two organizations were not bad, and the Tatra Association (as the Polish Tatra Association was called before 1920) was even a member of the Beskidenverein, and both organizations granted each other discounts. However, in 1904/1905, the conflict escalated when the Tatra Association decided to establish a branch covering the Beskids and to build a mountain hut at Markowe Szczawiny. At that time, the Poles decided to stop granting discounts to Beskidenverein members, although formally they did not withdraw from its structures. Conflicts continued after 1918, practically until the end of the interwar period. Short periods of cooperation were interspersed with a struggle for tourists, often conducted illegally, such as sabotaging opponents' trails. The main reason for this rivalry was the national issue – Beskidenverein promoted German identity and mainly served German tourists, while the Tatra Association sought to limit German influence.
The Polish state made attempts to force the Beskidenverein to merge with the Tatra Association in order to limit its influence in the Beskids (which was not done in relation to other tourist organizations). German facilities were meticulously controlled, Tatra cards for crossing the mountain border with Czechoslovakia were not issued, and sabotage occurred (not only trail repainting, which both sides engaged in, but also arson). German activists complained that in the reports of Polish commissioners, better-equipped Beskidenverein mountain huts fared worse than Polish ones. Another activity was the placement of Polish facilities near existing German buildings – this avoided cumbersome building procedures, and German huts had fewer tourists. Beskidenverein, due to its economic activity, had to pay taxes, while Polish tourist organizations were exempt as public utility entities. This raised frequent suspicions and grievances among Polish Germans that the Polish state did not treat them the same as their Polish counterparts.
Similarly to before the war, the strongest section in independent Poland was the Bielsko section, which took on an informal leading role in Beskidenverein (in meetings with other tourist organizations, Polish Beskidenverein often appeared as Beskidenverein Bielsko) – it was the most active and had the largest number of members (the largest number of Germans in Polish Silesia and western Lesser Poland lived in Bielsko and Biała). Bielsko also became the main headquarters of the Polish part of Beskidenverein, which, according to Polish law, could not be part of a foreign association, so it separated from the sections that ended up in Czechoslovakia.
In 1927, the Society had about 4,000 members, in 1933 5,000 members, but later their number gradually decreased – in 1936 it was supposed to be about 1,600, but this value seems understated.
The strongest section from Bielsko had 2,300 members in 1927 (compared to 1,035 in 1911), and in 1931 – 2,600.
In the second half of the 1930s, some Beskidenverein activists' alignment with the Jungdeutsche Partei – which supported Hitler and pursued an anti-Polish policy – cast a shadow over the association. Some Beskidenverein members were also members of the ""Young German Party"" and used association facilities for supervision and espionage purposes.


=== Attempts at agreement and conflicts with the Polish Tatra Association ===
In the early 1920s, the Tatra Association proposed to Beskidenverein to join the Polish organization as a separate branch (this was also demanded by Polish authorities) – Beskidenverein did not respond to this proposal, fearing absorption by the Poles and seeing it as an attack on its own sovereignty and the longstanding tradition of pioneering tourism in the Beskids. In areas where trail blazing activities were conducted, attempts were made to obtain exclusivity.
In 1927, the Union of Beskidy Associations in Poland (Verband Beskidenvereine in Polen) was established with its main headquarters in Bielsko. It was formed by non-Polish tourist organizations to have greater impact in competition with Polish organizations. In addition to Beskidenverein, the Society of Friends of Nature (Naturfreunde) from Bielsko and Aleksandrowice (Alexanderfeld), the Winter Sports Club from Bielsko (which soon after its establishment separated from the ""mountain"" Beskidenverein), the Jewish Sports Society Makkabi from Bielsko, and the German Alpine Club, which had its section in Katowice since 1913 and counted 307 members in 1930, were included. At that time, Beskidenverein also competed with Polish organizations in terms of membership fees – at the end of the 1920s, the fee was 5 złoty plus 1 złoty entrance fee, which entitled members to a 50% discount at mountain huts belonging to the Beskidy Associations in Poland and Czechoslovakia (and at facilities of affiliated organizations) – at the same time, the Tatra Association charged 18 złoty and 5 złoty, respectively.
In early 1928, a dispute erupted over the expansion of the mountain hut on Babia Góra – Poles protested, fearing that a larger German hut would marginalize the facility at Markowe Szczawiny and simultaneously pointing out that the expansion would take place in a nature-protected area. The Nowy Targ County sided with the Tatra Association and prohibited work on the German hut. In response to this situation, Beskidenverein decided to build a new facility in another part of the Beskids – in Hala Lipowska.
In October 1928, a joint conference was held at the Tatra Association premises in Katowice to end the conflict. Beskidenverein appeared as the Beskidy Associations in Poland, representing existing branches from Bielsko and Biała, Cieszyn, Pszczyna, Nowy Bytom, Królewska Huta, and other allied organizations. The Poles agreed to let Beskidenverein conduct trail blazing according to its system in the areas around Magura, Klimczok, Błatnia, and Skrzyczne (where it was most active), while the trail from Przyborów to Babia Góra would remain under German supervision, but with Tatra Association trail blazing. The Polish organization did not rule out enlarging the ""zone of influence"" of Beskidenverein but demanded restrictions on activities in the area from Cieszyn to Babia Góra (thus in the southern regions of Polish Silesian and Żywiec Beskids), where Tatra Association already dominated.
In 1929, another meeting of delegates from both organizations took place, this time in Cieszyn. Once again, the territorial scope of Beskidenverein's activities was established (it did not differ significantly from that in Katowice) – Little Beskids on the left bank of the Soła river, the Klimczok group (including Błatnia) up to the Beskidek pass between Brenna and Szczyrk, the route to Skrzyczne, and the trails to the mountain hut on Babia Góra and to the Salmopolska pass. At the same time, Beskidenverein activists definitively refused to join the Polish Tatra Association and recognize its authority.
In 1931, Beskidenverein joined the Union of Polish Tourist Associations in Warsaw (established in 1927), but this did not lead to any specific solutions; too many different organizations were part of it, often representing conflicting interests, and numerous conflicts led to its dissolution in 1937.
The agreement reached in Katowice and Cieszyn lasted only until 1931 when the Polish Tatra Association obtained exclusivity from the Ministry of Public Works for conducting tourist activities in the mountains – all other organizations were required to coordinate their activities with Polish Tatra Association. Naturally, Beskidenverein activists did not accept this state of affairs. Unable to expand the mountain hut on Babia Góra, they appealed to the ministry for funding to build a new facility on Hala Lipowska. However, it turned out that the necessary funds had already been allocated to Polish Tatra Association, with whom the matter of construction and any potential subsidies needed to be discussed. The Poles positively assessed the needs of Beskidenverein but allocated funds for the repair of hiking trails and current maintenance in existing huts. They did not approve the construction of a new German facility, arguing that it was outside the ""zone of influence"" agreed upon in Katowice in 1928. Beskidenverein did not accept Polish Tatra Association's authority to decide on the location of new huts and, as a legal purchaser of the appropriate land, commenced construction after obtaining the necessary administrative permits. By the end of 1931, the foundation had been laid, and the structure was winterized to accommodate tourists. It was officially opened in August of the following year (during World War II, it operated under the name Dr. Stonawski-Schutzhaus); after numerous renovations, it continues to serve its purpose to this day.
In 1931, the Polish Tourist Association officially recognized all contacts with Beskidenverein as severed. At a meeting of one of the subcommittees, it was also decided, among other things, to demarcate the areas previously allocated to Beskidenverein between its own branches and to request the relevant county offices not to issue building permits without Polish Tatra Association's consent. In a less official manner, the Poles also intended to draw the authorities' attention to what they considered suspicious political activities by Beskidenverein, and the Border Guard was to carefully monitor tourists of German nationality moving along the trails without mountain passes (which were issued only by Polish Tatra Association). Other proposals included conducting a propaganda campaign in the editorial offices of the most popular Polish newspapers, taking action to remove Beskidenverein from the Union of Polish Tourist Associations in Warsaw, and excluding all Beskidenverein members who were also members of Polish Tatra Association from the Polish society.
The attitude of the state towards Beskidenverein changed in 1934 when in January Poland and Germany signed a declaration of non-aggression. In 1935, the Ministry of Communication demanded that Polish Tatra Association and Union of Polish Tourist Associations start inviting Beskidenverein as an equal partner to discuss tourist affairs, but the Territorial Conciliation Commission (composed of Polish Tatra Association and Union of Polish Tourist Associations activists) rejected this demand using procedural and regulatory loopholes.
Some improvement in mutual relations occurred in 1936 – Beskidenverein took into account Polish demands to lower prices in mountain huts, which was aimed at popularizing tourism (for example, in the shelter on Hala Lipowska, Beskidenverein members paid 1.20 złoty for accommodation, non-member tourists paid 2.30 złoty, while school and group trips had significant discounts – 1.50 złoty and the possibility of negotiation down to 0.80 złoty, respectively).
The escalation of the international situation cast a shadow on mountain tourism – in 1937, Hala Lipowska was included in the border zone, which resulted in restrictions on tourist traffic; the reason was suspicions of the shelter owners' anti-Polish activities. These suspicions later proved to be unfounded, also in relation to the owner of the nearby shelter on Hala Rysianka, which was officially a ""Polish"" facility. However, since the shelters on Rysianka (located closer to the border) were not included in the border zone, Beskidenverein activists perceived the Polish authorities' move as another harassment towards them. In 1939, due to increasing Polish-German tension, access to the Lipowska mountain hut was completely blocked.
In the same year, in Szczyrk, the Beskidenverein skiing championships took place. Thanks to the favorable attitude of the Polish state, a radio broadcast of the event was conducted on the waves of German radio – this was an unprecedented event in the history of sports events in the Silesian Beskids.
According to the last pre-war registry in August 1939, the Polish Beskidenverein had 1882 members – mainly from Upper Silesia, but also from distant cities, including Chojnice, Grudziądz, Gdańsk, Leszno, Poznań, Stanisławów, Toruń, and Warsaw.


=== New mountain huts in independent Poland ===

In addition to the aforementioned shelter on Hala Lipowska, Beskidenverein also acquired further shelters:

Kozia Góra (Rodelhütte, commonly known as Stefanka after the name of the Beskidenverein president, Dr. Karol Steffan) – 1926;
Klimczok (Klementinenhütte) – the facility was leased in 1930 from its previous owner, Baron Klobus from Łodygowice, preempting Polish Tatra Association.
There was also a tourist station named Biały Krzyż (White Cross) located in a school building on Salmopolska pass – it was destroyed in 1945 during a skirmi",1

Cocobolo,"Cocobolo is a tropical hardwood of Central American trees belonging to the genus Dalbergia. Only the heartwood of cocobolo is used; it is usually orange or reddish-brown, often with darker irregular traces weaving through the wood. The heartwood changes color after being cut and can be polished to a lustrous, glassy finish. Being quite dense and sometimes having a specific gravity of over 1.0, it will sink in water. The sapwood (not often used) is a creamy yellow with a sharp boundary between it and the heartwood.


== Provenance ==
Cocobolo is yielded by two to four closely related species of the genus Dalbergia, of which the best known is Dalbergia retusa, a fair-sized tree, reported to reach 75–80 ft (23–24 m) in height and 3 ft (0.9 m) in diameter; it probably is the species contributing most of the wood in the trade. Because of the high value of the timber, the trees yielding it have been heavily exploited, so they have become rare outside of national parks, reserves, and plantations. Only small amounts of this prized wood reach the world market, and it is expensive.


== Oil content ==
Cocobolo heartwood contains oil, which lends a strong, unmistakable floral odor even to well seasoned wood and occasionally stains the hands with prolonged exposure. The high natural oil content of the wood makes it difficult to achieve a strong glue joint, as in applying veneers or guitar fingerboards, and can inhibit the curing of some varnishes, particularly oil-based finishes. Acetone may be used to remove surface oils before gluing. The oil can induce allergic reactions if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin and eyes. This is due to the presence of allergenic chemicals such as S-4'-hydroxy-4-methoxy dalbergione, R-4-methoxy dalbergione, and other quinones and phenols. A dust collection system, coupled with the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators, is highly recommended when machining this wood.


== Uses ==
Because it stands up well to repeated handling and exposure to water, a common use is for gun grips and knife handles, and duck calls. It is very hard, fine textured, and dense, yet easily machined. The abundance of natural oils, however, causes the wood to clog abrasives and fine-toothed saw blades, like other hard, dense tropical woods. Besides its use on guns and knives, cocobolo is favored for fine inlay work on custom, high-end cue sticks, police batons, pens, brush backs, bowls, pipes, jewelry boxes, desktops and other expensive specialty items.


== Musical instruments ==
Due to its density and hardness, even a large block of the cut wood will produce a clear musical tone if struck. Renowned for its ""warm, rich palette"", cocobolo is used to make musical instruments, such as oboes, flutes and clarinets--especially boutique, custom barrel joints for B-flat clarinets. Other woodwind instruments, such as bagpipes (as well as the chanters of bagpipes' more basic relatives, duck and goose calls), have been successfully made using cocobolo instead of the orchestral and Celtic instruments' customary mpingo, or African blackwood, known in the trade as grenadilla. Additionally, cocobolo has been used to make fingerboards, as well as entire necks and bodies of guitars and bass guitars, having been employed as a substitute for Brazilian Rosewood since that fellow Dalbergia member was CITES listed in 1992. Additionally, cocobolo is used to an extent in building drums.


== Conservation ==
Logs, sawn wood, and veneer sheets from the Guatemalan populations of Cocobolo (Dalbergia retusa), have been listed under CITES Appendix III since 2008. In 2011, Panama extended that listing to include all products except seeds and pollen and finished products packaged and ready for retail trade. 
As of January 2, 2017, Cocobolo is protected as a CITES Appendix II species, along with Bubinga (Guibourtia demeusei, G. pellegriniana, and G. tessmanni), other true rosewoods (Dalbergia spp.) and related species found in the Dalbergia genus, such as Tulipwood, Kingwood, and African Blackwood.


== In popular culture ==
Paraguayan cocobolo was closely associated with David Woodard's iteration of the Dreamachine.
Jim Jarmusch's 2013 film Only Lovers Left Alive features a bullet fashioned from cocobolo and brass.
One plotline in the television show Better Call Saul revolves around the acquisition of a cocobolo desk.
A cocobolo log plays a prominent role in the ""Dead Moon Walking Adventure"" episode of The Great North.

Solar reforming,"Solar reforming is the sunlight-driven conversion of diverse carbon waste resources (including solid, liquid, and gaseous waste streams such as biomass, plastics, industrial by-products, atmospheric carbon dioxide, etc.) into sustainable fuels (or energy vectors) and value-added chemicals. It encompasses a set of technologies (and processes) operating under ambient and aqueous conditions, utilizing solar spectrum to generate maximum value. Solar reforming offers an attractive and unifying solution to address the contemporary challenges of climate change and environmental pollution by creating a sustainable circular network of waste upcycling, clean fuel (and chemical) generation and the consequent mitigation of greenhouse emissions (in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals).


== Background ==
The earliest sunlight-driven reforming (now referred to as photoreforming or PC reforming which forms a small sub-section of solar reforming; see Definition and classifications section) of waste-derived substrates involved the use of TiO2 semiconductor photocatalyst (generally loaded with a hydrogen evolution co-catalyst such as Pt). Kawai and Sakata from the Institute for Molecular Science, Okazaki, Japan in the 1980s reported that the organics derived from different solid waste matter could be used as electron donors to drive the generation of hydrogen gas over TiO2 photocatalyst composites. In 2017, Wakerley, Kuehnel and Reisner at the University of Cambridge, UK demonstrated the photocatalytic production of hydrogen using raw lignocellulosic biomass substrates in the presence of visible-light responsive CdS|CdOx quantum dots under alkaline conditions. This was followed by the utilization of less-toxic, carbon-based, visible-light absorbing photocatalyst composites (for example carbon-nitride based systems) for biomass and plastics photoreforming to hydrogen and organics by Kasap, Uekert and Reisner. In addition to variations of carbon nitride, other photocatalyst composite systems based on graphene oxides, MXenes, co-ordination polymers and metal chalcogenides were reported during this period. A major limitation of PC reforming is the use of conventional harsh alkaline pre-treatment conditions (pH >13 and high temperatures) for polymeric substrates such as condensation plastics, accounting for more than 80% of the operation costs. This was circumvented with the introduction of a new chemoenzymatic reforming pathway in 2023 by Bhattacharjee, Guo, Reisner and Hollfelder, which employed near-neutral pH, moderate temperatures for pre-treating plastics and nanoplastics. In 2020, Jiao and Xie reported the photocatalytic conversion of addition plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene to high energy-density to C2 fuels over a Nb2O5 catalyst under natural conditions.
The photocatalytic process (referred to as PC reforming; see Categorization and configurations section below) offers a simple, one-pot and facile deployment scope, but has several major limitations, making it challenging for commercial implementation. In 2021, sunlight-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems/technologies operating with no external bias or voltage input were introduced by Bhattacharjee and Reisner at the University of Cambridge. These PEC reforming (see Categorization and configurations section) systems reformed diverse pre-treated waste streams (such as lignocellulose and PET plastics) to selective value-added chemicals with the simultaneous generation of green hydrogen, and achieving areal production rates 100-10000 times higher than conventional photocatalytic processes. In 2023, Bhattacharjee, Rahaman and Reisner extended the PEC platform to a solar reactor which could reduce greenhouse gas CO2 to different energy vectors (CO, syngas, formate depending on the type of catalyst integrated) and convert waste PET plastics to glycolic acid at the same time. This further inspired the direct capture and conversion of CO2 to products from flue gas and air (direct air capture) in a PEC reforming process (with simultaneous plastic conversion). Choi and Ryu demonstrated a polyoxometallate-medated PEC process to achieve biomass conversion with unassisted hydrogen production in 2022. Similarly, Pan and Chu, in 2023  reported a PEC cell for renewable formate production from sunlight, CO2 and biomass-derived sugars. These developments has led solar reforming (and electroreforming, where renewable electricity drives redox processes; see Caterogization and configurations section) to gradually emerge as an active area of exploration.


== Concept and considerations ==


=== Definition and classifications ===
Solar reforming is the sunlight-driven transformation of waste substrates to valuable products (such as sustainable fuels and chemicals) as defined by scientists Subhajit Bhattacharjee, Stuart Linley and Erwin Reisner in their 2024 Nature Reviews Chemistry article where they conceptualized and formalized the field by introducing its concepts, classification, configurations and metrics. It generally operates without external heating and pressure, and also introduces a thermodynamic advantage over traditional green hydrogen or CO2 reduction fuel producing methods such as water splitting or CO2 splitting, respectively. Depending on solar spectrum utilization, solar reforming can be classified into two categories: ""solar catalytic reforming"" and ""solar thermal reforming"". Solar catalytic reforming refers to transformation processes primarily driven by ultraviolet (UV) or visible light. It also includes the subset of 'photoreforming' encompassing utilization of high energy photons in the UV or near-UV region of the solar spectrum (for example, by semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2). Solar thermal reforming, on the other hand, exploits the infrared (IR) region for waste upcycling to generate products of high economic value. An important aspect of solar reforming is value creation, which means that the overall value creation from product formation must be greater than substrate value destruction. In terms of deployment architectures, solar catalytic reforming can be further categorized into: photocatalytic reforming (PC reforming), photoelectrochemical reforming (PEC reforming) and photovoltaic-electrochemical reforming (PV-EC reforming).


=== Advantages over conventional waste recycling and upcycling processes ===
Solar reforming offers several advantages over conventional methods of waste management or fuel/chemical production. It offers a less energy-intensive and low carbon alterative to methods of waste reforming such as pyrolysis and gasification which require high energy input. Solar reforming also provides several benefits over traditional green hydrogen production methods such as water splitting (H2O → H2 + ⁠1/2⁠O2, ΔG° = 237 kJ mol−1). It offers a thermodynamic advantage over water splitting by circumventing the energetically and kinetically demanding water oxidation half reaction (E0 = +1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) by energetically neutral oxidation of waste-derived organics (CxHyOz + (2x−z)H2O → (2x−z+y/2)H2 + xCO2; ΔG° ~0 kJ mol−1). This results in better performance in terms of higher production rates, and also translates to other similar processes which depend on water oxidation as the counter reaction such as CO2 splitting. Furthermore, concentrated streams of hydrogen produced from solar reforming is safer than explosive mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen (from traditional water splitting), that otherwise require additional separation costs. The added economic advantage of forming two different valuable products (for example, gaseous reductive fuels and liquid oxidative chemicals) simultaneously makes solar reforming suitable for commercial applications.


=== Solar reforming metrics ===
Solar reforming encompasses a range of technological processes and configurations and therefore, suitable performance metrics can evaluate the commercial viability. In artificial photosynthesis, the most common metric is the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency (ηSTF) as shown below, where 'r' is the product formation rate, 'ΔG' is the Gibbs free energy change during the process, 'A' is the sunlight irradiation area and 'P' is the total light intensity flux. The ηSTF can be adopted as a metric for solar reforming but with certain considerations. Since the ΔG values for solar reforming processes are very low (ΔG ~0 kJ mol‒1), this makes the ηSTF per definition close to zero, despite the high production rates and quantum yields. However, replacing the ΔG for product formation (during solar reforming) with that of product utilisation (|ΔGuse|; such as combustion of the hydrogen fuel generated) can give a better representation of the process efficiency.

Since solar reforming is highly dependent on the light harvester and its area of photon collection, a more technologically relevant metric is the areal production rate (rareal) as shown, where 'n' is the moles of product formed, 'A' is the sunlight irradiation area and 't' is the time.

Although rareal is a more consistent metric for solar reforming, it neglects some key parameters such as type of waste utilized, pre-treatment costs, product value, scaling, other process and separation costs, deployment variables, etc. Therefore, a more adaptable and robust metric is the solar-to-value creation rate (rSTV) which can encompass all these factors and provide a more holistic and practical picture from the economic or commercial point of view. The simplified equation for rSTV is shown below, where Ci and Ck are the costs of the product 'i' and substrate 'k', respectively. Cp is the pre-treatment cost for the waste substrate 'k', and ni and nk are amounts (in moles) of the product 'i' formed and substrate 'k' consumed during solar reforming, respectively. Note that the metric is adaptable and can be expanded to include other relevant parameters as applicable.

=== Categorization and configurations ===
Solar reforming depends on the properties of the light absorber and the catalysts involved, and their selection, screening and integration to generate maximum value. The design and deployment of solar reforming technologies dictates the efficiency, scale and target substrates/products. In this context, solar reforming (more specifically, solar catalytic reforming) can be classified into three architectures:

Photocatalytic (PC) reforming - PC reforming is a one-pot process involving homogeneous or heterogenous photocatalyst suspensions (or immobilized photocatalysts on sheets or floating materials for easy recovery), which, under sunlight irradiation generate charge carriers (electron-hole pairs) to catalyze redox reactions (UV or near-UV based photoreforming systems generally also come under PC reforming). Despite the low cost and simplicity of PC reforming, there are major drawbacks of this approach which includes low product formation rates, poor selectivity of oxidation products or overoxidation to release CO2, challenging catalyst/process optimization and harsh pre-treatment conditions.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) reforming - PEC reforming involves the use of PEC systems/assemblies which consist of separated (photo)electrodes generally connected using a wire and submerged in solution (electrolyte). A photoelectrode consists of a light-absorber and additional charge transport and catalyst layers to facilitate the redox processes. While conventional PEC systems typically require a bias or voltage input in addition to the energy obtained from incident light irradiation, PEC reforming ideally operates with a single light absorber without any external bias or voltage (that is, completely driven by sunlight). PEC reforming can already produce clean fuels and valuable chemicals with high selectivity and achieve production rates which are 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than conventional PC processes. The spatial separation between the redox processes offered by PEC systems allows flexibility in the screening and integration of light-absorbers and catalysts, and also better product separation. They can also benefit from better spectral utilization such as using solar concentrators or thermoelectric modules to harvest heat, thereby improving reaction kinetics and performance. The versatility and high performance of these new PEC arrangements, therefore has wide scope of further exploitation and research.
PV-EC reforming and extension to 'electroreforming' systems - PV-EC reforming refers to the use of electricity generated from photovoltaic panels (and therefore driven by sunlight) to drive electrochemical (electrolysis) reactions for waste reforming. The concept of PV-EC reforming can be further extended to 'electroreforming' where renewable electricity from sources other than the sun (for example, wind, hydro, nuclear, among others) is used to power the electrochemical reactions achieving valuable fuel and chemical production from waste feedstocks. While traditionally most electrolysers, including commercial ones focus on water splitting to produce hydrogen, new electrochemical systems, catalysts and concepts have emerged which have started to look into waste substrates for utilisation as sustainable feedstocks.


== Introduction of 'Photon Economy' ==
An important concept introduced in the context of solar reforming is the 'photon economy', which, as defined by Bhattacharjee, Linley and Reisner, is the maximum utilization of all incident photons for maximizing product formation and value creation. An ideal solar reforming process is one where the light absorber can absorb incident UV and visible light photons with maximum quantum yield, generating high charge carrier concentration to drive redox half reactions at maximum rate. On the other hand, the residual, non-absorbed low-energy IR photons may be used for boosting reaction kinetics, waste pre-treatment or other means of value creation (for example, desalination, etc.). Therefore, proper light and thermal management through various means (such as using solar concentrators, thermoelectric modules, among others) is encouraged to have both an atom economical and photon economical approach to extract maximum value from solar reforming processes.


== Reception and media ==
The technological advancements in solar reforming garnered widespread interest in recent years. The works from scientists at Cambridge on PC reforming of raw lignocellulosic biomass or pre-treated polyester plastics to produce hydrogen and organics attracted attention of several stakeholders. The recent technological breakthrough leading to the development of high-performing solar powered reactors (PEC reforming) for the simultaneous upcycling of greenhouse gas CO2 and waste plastics to sustainable products received widespread acclaim and was highlighted in several prominent national and international media outlets. Solar reforming processes primarily developed in Cambridge were also selected as ""one of the eleven great ideas from British universities that could change the world"" by Sunday Times (April 2020 edition) and featured in the UK Prime Minister's Speech on Net Zero, ""Or the researchers at Cambridge who pioneered a new way to turn sunlight into fuel"" (indicating solar reforming which was a major subset of the broader research activities at Cambridge).


== Outlook and future scope ==
Solar reforming is currently in the development phase and the scalable deployment of a particular solar reforming technology (PC, PEC or PV-EC) would depend on a variety of factors. These factors include deployment location and sunlight variability/intermittency, characteristics of the chosen waste stream, viable pre-treatment methods, target products, nature of the catalysts and their lifetime, fuel/chemical storage requirements, land use versus open water sources, capital and operational costs, production and solar-to-value creation rates, and governmental policies and incentives, among others. Solar reforming may not be only limited to the conventional chemical pathways discussed, and may also include other relevant industrial processes such as light-driven organic transformations, flow photochemistry, integration with industrial electrolysis, among others. The products from conventional solar reforming such as green hydrogen or other platform chemicals have a broad value-chain. It is also now understood that sustainable fuel/chemical producing technologies of the future will rely on biomass, plastics and CO2 as key carbon feedstocks to replace fossil fuels. Therefore, with sunlight being abundant and the cheapest source of energy, solar reforming is well-positioned to drive decarbonization and facilitate the transition from a linear to circular economy in the coming decades.

Periodicity of solar eclipses,"Eclipses may occur repeatedly, separated by certain intervals of time: these intervals are called eclipse cycles.  The series of eclipses separated by a repeat of one of these intervals is called an eclipse series.


== Eclipse conditions ==

Eclipses may occur when Earth and the Moon are aligned with the Sun, and the shadow of one body projected by the Sun falls on the other. So at new moon, when the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun, the Moon may pass in front of the Sun as viewed from a narrow region on the surface of Earth and cause a solar eclipse. At full moon, when the Moon is in opposition to the Sun, the Moon may pass through the shadow of Earth, and a lunar eclipse is visible from the night half of Earth. The conjunction and opposition of the Moon together have a special name: syzygy (Greek for ""junction""), because of the importance of these lunar phases.
An eclipse does not occur at every new or full moon, because the plane of the Moon's orbit around Earth is tilted with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic): so as viewed from Earth, when the Moon appears nearest the Sun (at new moon) or furthest from it (at full moon), the three bodies are usually not exactly on the same line.
This inclination is on average about 5° 9′, much larger than the apparent mean diameter of the Sun (32′ 2″), the Moon as viewed from Earth's surface directly below the Moon (31′ 37″), and Earth's shadow at the mean lunar distance (1° 23′).
Therefore, at most new moons, Earth passes too far north or south of the lunar shadow, and at most full moons, the Moon misses Earth's shadow. Also, at most solar eclipses, the apparent angular diameter of the Moon is insufficient to fully occlude the solar disc, unless the Moon is around its perigee, i.e. nearer Earth and apparently larger than average. In any case, the alignment must be almost perfect to cause an eclipse.
An eclipse can occur only when the Moon is on or near the plane of Earth's orbit, i.e. when its ecliptic latitude is low. This happens when the Moon is around either of the two orbital nodes on the ecliptic at the time of the syzygy. Of course, to produce an eclipse, the Sun must also be around a node at that time – the same node for a solar eclipse or the opposite node for a lunar eclipse.


== Recurrences ==

Up to three eclipses may occur during an eclipse season, a one- or two-month period that happens twice a year, around the time when the Sun is near the nodes of the Moon's orbit.
An eclipse does not occur every month, because one month after an eclipse the relative geometry of the Sun, Moon, and Earth has changed.
As seen from the Earth, the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node, the draconic month, is less than the time it takes for the Moon to return to the same ecliptic longitude as the Sun: the synodic month. The main reason is that during the time that the Moon has completed an orbit around the Earth, the Earth (and Moon) have completed about 1⁄13 of their orbit around the Sun: the Moon has to make up for this in order to come again into conjunction or opposition with the Sun. Secondly, the orbital nodes of the Moon precess westward in ecliptic longitude, completing a full circle in about  18.60 years, so a draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month. In all, the difference in period between synodic and draconic month is nearly 2+1⁄3 days. Likewise, as seen from the Earth, the Sun passes both nodes as it moves along its ecliptic path. The period for the Sun to return to a node is called the eclipse or draconic year: about 346.6201 days, which is about 1⁄20 year shorter than a sidereal year because of the precession of the nodes.
If a solar eclipse occurs at one new moon, which must be close to a node, then at the next full moon the Moon is already more than a day past its opposite node, and may or may not miss the Earth's shadow. By the next new moon it is even further ahead of the node, so it is less likely that there will be a solar eclipse somewhere on Earth. By the next month, there will certainly be no event.
However, about 5 or 6 lunations later the new moon will fall close to the opposite node. In that time (half an eclipse year) the Sun will have moved to the opposite node too, so the circumstances will again be suitable for one or more eclipses.


== Periodicity ==

The periodicity of solar eclipses is the interval between any two solar eclipses in succession, which will be either 1, 5, or 6 synodic months. It is calculated that the Earth will experience a total number of 11,898 solar eclipses between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. A particular solar eclipse will be repeated approximately after every 18 years 11 days and 8 hours (6,585.32 days) of period, but not in the same geographical region.
A particular geographical region will experience a particular solar eclipse in every 54 years 34 days period. Total solar eclipses are rare events, although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average.


=== Repetition of solar eclipses ===
For two solar eclipses to be almost identical, the geometric alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun, as well as some parameters of the lunar orbit should be the same. The following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a solar eclipse:

The Moon must be in new phase.
The longitude of perigee or apogee of the Moon must be the same.
The longitude of the ascending node or descending node must be the same.
The Earth will be nearly the same distance from the Sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation.
These conditions are related to the three periods of the Moon's orbital motion, viz. the synodic month, anomalistic month and draconic month, and to the anomalistic year. In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. This happens after the period called the saros. Gamma (how far the Moon is north or south of the ecliptic during an eclipse) changes monotonically throughout any single saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average.

These conditions are related with the three periods of the Moon's orbital motion, viz. the synodic month, anomalistic month and draconic month. In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. Gamma changes monotonically throughout any single Saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average.


=== Eclipses would not occur in every month ===

Another thing to consider is that the motion of the Moon is not a perfect circle.  Its orbit is distinctly elliptic, so the lunar distance from Earth varies throughout the lunar cycle. This varying distance changes the apparent diameter of the Moon, and therefore influences the chances, duration, and type (partial, annular, total, mixed) of an eclipse.  This orbital period is called the anomalistic month, and together with the synodic month causes the so-called ""full moon cycle"" of about 14 lunations in the timings and appearances of full (and new) Moons. The Moon moves faster when it is closer to the Earth (near perigee) and slower when it is near apogee (furthest distance), thus periodically changing the timing of syzygies by up to 14 hours either side (relative to their mean timing), and causing the apparent lunar angular diameter to increase or decrease by about 6%.  An eclipse cycle must comprise close to an integer number of anomalistic months in order to perform well in predicting eclipses.
If the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the Earth, and both orbits were coplanar (on the same plane) with each other, then two eclipses would happen every lunar month (29.53 days). A lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon, a solar eclipse every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type. In fact the distances between the Earth and Moon and that of the Earth and the Sun vary because both the Earth and the Moon have elliptic orbits. Also, both the orbits are not on the same plane. The Moon's orbit is inclined about 5.14° to Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes. If a New Moon takes place within about 17° of a node, then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on Earth.
At an average angular velocity of 0.99° per day, the Sun takes 34.5 days to cross the 34° wide eclipse zone centered on each node. Because the Moon's orbit with respect to the Sun has a mean duration of 29.53 days, there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each 34.5-day interval when the Sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones. These time periods are called eclipse seasons. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon's orbit is low, hence the Sun, Moon, and Earth become aligned straight enough (in syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.


== Numerical values ==
These are the lengths of the various types of months as discussed above (according to the lunar ephemeris ELP2000-85, valid for the epoch J2000.0; taken from (e.g.) Meeus (1991) ):

SM =  29.530588853 days   (Synodic month)
DM =  27.212220817 days   (Draconic month)
AM =  27.55454988  days   (Anomalistic month)
EY = 346.620076    days   (Eclipse year)
Note that there are three main moving points: the Sun, the Moon, and the (ascending) node; and that there are three main periods, when each of the three possible pairs of moving points meet one another: the synodic month when the Moon returns to the Sun, the draconic month when the Moon returns to the node, and the eclipse year when the Sun returns to the node.  These three 2-way relations are not independent (i.e. both the synodic month and eclipse year are dependent on the apparent motion of the Sun, both the draconic month and eclipse year are dependent on the motion of the nodes), and indeed the eclipse year can be described as the beat period of the synodic and draconic months (i.e. the period of the difference between the synodic and draconic months); in formula:

as can be checked by filling in the numerical values listed above.
Eclipse cycles have a period in which a certain number of synodic months closely equals an integer or half-integer number of draconic months: one such period after an eclipse, a syzygy (new moon or full moon) takes place again near a node of the Moon's orbit on the ecliptic, and an eclipse can occur again.  However, the synodic and draconic months are incommensurate: their ratio is not an integer number. We need to approximate this ratio by common fractions: the numerators and denominators then give the multiples of the two periods – draconic and synodic months – that (approximately) span the same amount of time, representing an eclipse cycle.
These fractions can be found by the method of continued fractions: this arithmetical technique provides a series of progressively better approximations of any real numeric value by proper fractions.
Since there may be an eclipse every half draconic month, we need to find approximations for the number of half draconic months per synodic month: so the target ratio to approximate is: SM / (DM/2) = 29.530588853 / (27.212220817/2) = 2.170391682
The continued fractions expansion for this ratio is:

Each of these is an eclipse cycle.  Less accurate cycles may be constructed by combinations of these.


== Eclipse cycles ==
This table summarizes the characteristics of various eclipse cycles, and can be computed from the numerical results of the preceding paragraphs; cf. Meeus (1997) Ch.9. More details are given in the comments below, and several notable cycles have their own pages. Many other cycles have been noted, some of which have been named.
The number of days given is the average. The actual number of days and fractions of days between two eclipses varies because of the variation in the speed of the Moon and of the Sun in the sky. The variation is less if the number of anomalistic months is near a whole number, and if the number of anomalistic years is near a whole number. (See graphs lower down of semester and Hipparchic cycle.)
Any eclipse cycle, and indeed the interval between any two eclipses, can be expressed as a combination of saros (s) and inex (i) intervals. These are listed in the column ""formula"".


=== Notes ===
Fortnight
Half a synodic month (29.53 days). When there is an eclipse, there is a fair chance that at the next syzygy there will be another eclipse: the Sun and Moon will have moved about 15° with respect to the nodes (the Moon being opposite to where it was the previous time), but the luminaries may still be within bounds to make an eclipse. For example, penumbral lunar eclipse of May 26, 2002 is followed by the annular solar eclipse of June 10, 2002 and penumbral lunar eclipse of June 24, 2002. The shortest lunar fortnight between a new moon and a full moon lasts only about 13 days and 21.5 hours, while the longest such lunar fortnight lasts about 15 days and 14.5 hours. (Due to evection, these values are different going from quarter moon to quarter moon. The shortest lunar fortnight between first and last quarter moons lasts only about 13 days and 12 hours, while the longest lasts about 16 days and 2 hours.)
For more information see eclipse season.
Synodic month
Similarly, two events one synodic month apart have the Sun and Moon at two positions on either side of the node, 29° apart: both may cause a partial solar eclipse. For a lunar eclipse, it is a penumbral lunar eclipse.
Pentalunex
5 synodic months. Successive solar or lunar eclipses may occur 1, 5 or 6 synodic months apart. When two solar eclipses are one month apart, one will be seen near the Arctic Circle and the other near the Antarctic Circle. When they are five months apart, they are both seen near the Arctic Circle or both near the Antarctic Circle.
Semester
Half a lunar year. Eclipses will repeat exactly one semester apart at alternating nodes in a cycle that lasts for 8 or 9 eclipses. Because it is close to a half integer of anomalistic, draconic months, and tropical years, each solar eclipse will (usually) alternate between hemispheres each semester, as well as alternate between total and annular. Hence there is usually a maximum of one total or annular eclipse each in a given lunar year. (However, in the middle of an eight-semester series the hemispheres switch, and there is a switch during the series between whether the odd ones or the even ones are total.) It is possible to have two eclipses separated by a semester and a third eclipse one month before or after, so that two of the three are separated by seven months, but this only happens during certain centuries (see graph of inex versus date below). Because it is close to a half integer of anomalistic, draconic months, and tropical years, each lunar eclipse will usually alternate between edges of Earth's shadow each semester, as well as alternate between Lunar eclipses with the moon’s penumbral and umbral shadow difference less or greater than 1. Hence there is usually a maximum of one Lunar eclipse with Moon’s penumbral and umbral shadow difference less or greater than 1 each in a given lunar year.
Lunar year
Twelve (synodic) months, a little longer than an eclipse year: the Sun has returned to the node, so eclipses may again occur:
Hexon
6 eclipse seasons, and a fairly short eclipse cycle. Each eclipse in a hexon series (except the last) is followed by an eclipse whose saros series number is 8 lower, always occurring at the same node. It is equal to 35 synodic months, 1 less than 3 lunar years (36 synodic months). At any given time there are six hexon series active.
Hepton
7 eclipse seasons, and one of the less noteworthy eclipse cycles. Each eclipse in a hepton is followed by an eclipse 3 saros series before, always occurring at alternating nodes. It is equal to 41 synodic months. The interval is nearly a whole number of weeks (172.96), so each eclipse is followed by another that is usually on the same day of the week (moving backwards irregularly by an average of a quarter day). At any given time there are seven hepton series active.
Octon
8 eclipse seasons, 1⁄5 of the Metonic cycle, and a fairly decent short eclipse cycle, but poor in anomalistic returns. Each octon in a series is 2 saros apart, always occurring at the same node. It is equal to 47 synodic months. At any given time there are eight octon series active.
Tzolkinex
Includes a half draconic month, so occurs at alternating nodes and alternates between hemispheres. Each consecutive eclipse is a member of preceding saros series from the one before. Equal to nearly ten tzolk'ins. Every third tzolkinex in a series is near an integer number of anomalistic months and so will have similar properties.
Hibbardina
An eclipse ""cycle"" of at most 3 eclipses, but in fact meant as a period separating a pair of similar eclipses with opposite gamma values. Adding 1 lunation (for 112 synodic months) gives another period with the same property, the other half of a saros. The two surround a sar (half-saros). Named for William B. Hibbard who identified it in 1956. One lunar year less than a Hibbardina, 99 lunations, is only about a day and a half more than eight years.
Sar (half saros)
Includes an odd number of fortnights (223). As a result, eclipses alternate between lunar and solar with each cycle, occurring at the same node and with similar characteristics. A solar eclipse with small gamma will be followed by a very central total lunar eclipse. A solar eclipse where the Moon's penumbra just barely grazes the southern limb of Earth will be followed half a saros later by a lunar eclipse where the Moon just grazes the southern limb of the Earth's penumbra.
Tritos
Equal to an inex minus a saros. A triple tritos is close to an integer number of anomalistic months and so will have similar properties.
Saros
The best known eclipse cycle (described in the Almagest but not given this name), and one of the best for predicting eclipses, in which 223 synodic months equal 242 draconic months with an error of only 51 minutes. It is also very close to 239 anomalistic months, which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one saros apart very similar. Being a third of a day more than a whole number of days, each succeeding eclipse is centered about 120° further west over the Earth. If the Earth's orbit around the sun were circular, the saros cycle would be very close to a periodic orbit that would repeat exactly every 223 months.ὤ

Metonic cycle or enneadecaeteris
Nearly 6940 days, but as an eclipse cycle can be taken as 235 synodic months. This is just an hour and a half less than 19 years of 365+1⁄4 days. It is also 5 ""octon"" periods and close to 20 eclipse years, so it yields a short series of four or five eclipses on the same calendar date or on two calendar dates. It is equivalent to 110 ""hollow months"" of 29 days and 125 ""full months"" of 30 days.
Semanex
Equal to a whole number of weeks plus a hundredth of a day, so consecutive eclipses of the cycle are usually on the same day of the week. Each eclipse in this period is a member of a preceding saros series, always occurring on alternating nodes.
Thix
This eclipse cycle is just over 36 tzolk'ins, lasting 317 lunations. Each eclipse in this period is followed by an eclipse 4 saros series' later, always occurring on the same node.
Inex
Very convenient in the classification of eclipse cycles. One inex after an eclipse, another eclipse takes place at the opposite latitude. Inex series, after a sputtering beginning, go on for many thousands of years giving eclipses every 29 years minus 20 days, or 21 days if the last year has 366 days. Eighteen inex cycles (see ""Basic period"") are equal to 520.9996 Julian years so an inex is ⁠28+17/18⁠ Julian years. The inex cycle is the cycle that produces the highest number of eclipses while it lasts. Inex series 30 first produced a solar eclipse in saros series -245 (in 9435 BC), has been producing eclipses every 29 years since saros series -197 (in 8045 BC), and will continue long past AD 15,000, by which time it will have produced 707 consecutive eclipses. The name was introduced by George van den Bergh in 1951.
Exeligmos
A triple saros, with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of days, so the next eclipse will be visible at locations near the eclipse that occurred one exeligmos earlier, in contrast to the saros, in which the eclipse occurs about 8 hours later in the day or about 120° to the west of the eclipse that occurred one saros earlier. Ptolemy in the Almagest mentions it after discussing what we now call the saros, and says that it is called the exeligmos (ἐξελιγμός, meaning ""unrolling"").
Aubrey cycle
Named for the calculation of eclipses measured with Aubrey holes, located at Stonehenge. With 1385 fortnights, eclipses alternate between lunar and solar in 56 years minus 3.5 days.
Unidos
Very close to 65 years. Equals 67 lunar years and exceeds 65 Julian years by only 1.3 days (1.8 days over 65 average Gregorian years). Name suggested by Karl Palmen in that 2 saros are added over an inex. A period of three Unidos (195 years, a ""Trihex"") is quite close to both a whole number of anomalistic years and a whole number of anomalistic months, which means the interval between two eclipses is quite constant.
Callippic cycle
Originally defined as 4 Metonic cycles minus one day or precisely 76 years of 365+1⁄4 days. In the table, taken as 940 synodic months, equivalent to 441 hollow months and 499 full months. This cycle, though useful for example in the calculation of the date of Easter, can produce at most two solar eclipses (both partial) and at most two lunar eclipses (both penumbral). The Callipic cycle is 20 octons, and series of octons often produce only 21 eclipses, so only the first and the last of such a series are separated by a Callipic cycle. Most eclipses are not followed by another eclipse 940 lunations later, but rather 939 lunations later (two inex and a saros), which comes near an integer number of draconic months, producing similar eclipses. This is called a Short Callippic Period.
Triad
A triple inex, with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of anomalistic months, which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one Triad apart very similar, but at the opposite latitude. Almost exactly 87 calendar years minus 2 months. The triad means that every third saros series will be similar (central eclipses mostly total or mostly annular for example). Solar saros 130, 133, 136, 139, 142 and 145, for example, all produce mainly total eclipses when they are central, because the moon is close to perigee. In fact, at the solar eclipse of October 17, 1781, which was in saros series 130 and inex 50, was both very central and at perigee. But this repetition is not perfect. In about 2460 years, the above-mentioned series, 130, 133... (equivalent to 1 modulo 3) will give central solar eclipses that are annular, near apogee. In about 820 years central lunar eclipses, but not solar ones, will be near perigee every three saros series, and in around 1640 years the solar saros series with index equivalent to 2 modulo 3 will give central eclipses near perigee.
Quarter Palmen cycle
Named after Karl Palmen in that a saros is subtracted from 4 inex. Each eclipse is followed by an eclipse 4 saros series later, always occurring at the same node. It equals 97 years 9 months or 1209 lunations.
Mercury cycle
Equals approximately 353 synodic periods of Mercury, so that eclipses synchronize with the timing of Mercury's position in its orbit during each period, equaling 112 years minus one week or 1385 lunations.
Tritrix
Equals 3 inex plus 3 saros, which is 140 years 11 months or 1743 lunations, always occurring on alternating nodes. The tritrix is very close to a whole number of anomalistic months ((1867.9970) and close to a whole number of anomalistic years, which means the interval between two eclipses is quite constant. Two tritrix minus a saros (3263 lunations) is even closer to a whole number of anomaalistic months (3497.0018), being exactly thirteen seventeenths of the Cycle of Hipparchus (see below).
de la Hire cycle
A sextuple inex, adopted by Phillippe de la Hire in his Tabularum Astronomicarum in 1687. It equals 6 inex periods, which is 173 years and around 8 months, or 2148 lunations, equaling 179 lunar years, always occurring on the same node at nearly an integer number of anomalistic months, as it equals 2 triads.
Trihex
Equals 3 inex plus 6 saros, lasting 195 Julian years and 4 days or 2412 lunations, equaling 201 lunar years, always occurring at alternating nodes. Just two days over a whole number of anomalistic years and near a whole number of anomalistic months, which means the interval between two eclipses is quite constant.
Lambert II cycle
An eclipse cycle in which eclipses occur in similar circumstances, according to Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1765. (The ""Lambert I cycle is what we also call the inex.) Very close to a half-integer number of draconic months. It equals about 278 and a half years.
Macdonald cycle
An eclipse cycle equal to 299 years and about ten and a half months, always occurring on the same node. Peter Macdonald found that a series of eclipses of especially long duration visible from Britain occurs with this interval in the period AD 1 to 3000. A Macdonald series has around ten eclipses and lasts about 3000 years. All or most are on the same day of the week, since the interval is only about an hour less than a whole number of weeks and the length is fairly constant becauses the anomaly of the moon is almost constant.
Utting cycle
The seventh convergent in the continued fractions development between the ratio of the eclipse year and synodic month, if this ratio is approximated as between 2.17039173 and 2.17039179. Discussed by James Utting in 1827.
Selebit
An eclipse cycle where the number of eclipse years (354.5) closely matches (by chance) the number of days in a lunar year (354.371). It equals approximately 336 years 5 months 6 days or 4161 lunations. It is a convergent in the continued fractions development of the ratio between the eclipse year and the synodic month, giving a series of eclipses one selebit apart a life expectancy of thousands of years.
Cycle of Hipparchus
Not a long-lasting eclipse cycle, but Hipparchus constructed it to closely match an integer number of synodic and anomalistic months, years (345), and days. Because of it being close to a whole number of both anomalistic months and anomalistic years, its length is always within about an hour of 126007 days and half an hour. (See graphs lower down of semester and Hipparchic cycle.) This means that at the time of the second eclipse same side of the earth will be facing the sun as at the first eclipse (but the value of gamma will be different). By comparing his own eclipse observations with Babylonian records from 345 years earlier, Hipparchus could verify the accuracy of the various periods that the Chaldeans used. Ptolemy points out that dividing it by 17 still gives a whole number of synodic months (251) and anomalistic months (269), but this is not an eclipse interval because it is not near a whole or half integer number of draconic months.
Square year
An eclipse cycle where the number of solar years (365.371) closely matches (by chance) the number of days in 1 solar year (365.242). Lasting 365 years 4.5 months or 4519 lunations. It is the eighth convergent in the continued fractions development of the ratio between the eclipse year and the synodic month, giving a series of eclipses one square year apart a life expectancy of thousands of years. Many eclipses of our day belong to ""square year"" series or selebit series that have been going for over 13,000 years, and many will continue for over 13,000 years.
Gregoriana
Known for returning toward the same day of the week and Gregorian calendar date, as approximately an integer number of years, months, and weeks, are achieved, usually moving only a quarter day later in the Gregorian calendar.
Hexdodeka
Equal to six Unidos or two Trihex. Useful for giving accurate calculations of the timing of lunisolar syzygies.
Grattan Guinness cycle
The shortest cycle that gives eclipses on the same date (more or less) in both the Gregorian and in a 12-month lunar calendar, because it is almost exactly a whole number of Gregorian years (391.00029) as well as being exactly 403 12-month lunar years. Discovered by Henry Grattan Guinness in a speculative interpretation of Revelation 9:15.
Hipparchian
Fourteen inex plus two saros. The Almagest attributes this cycle to Hipparchus. George van den Bergh called it the ""Long Babylonian Period"" or the ""Old Babylonian Period"", but there is no evidence that the Babylonians were aware of it.
Basic period
Achieves nearly an integer number (521) of Julian years, anomalistic years (521 anomalistic years minus 5 days), and weeks (27185 weeks plus 0.1 day), leading to eclipses on the same day of the Julian calendar and week.
Chalepe
Equals 18 inex plus 2 saros, therefore 557 years plus about 1 month.

Log driving,"Log driving is a means of moving logs (sawn tree trunks) from a forest to sawmills and pulp mills downstream using the current of a river. It was the main transportation method of the early logging industry in Europe and North America.


== History ==

When the first sawmills were established, they were usually small water-powered facilities located near the source of timber, which might be converted to grist mills after farming became established when the forests had been cleared. Later, bigger circular sawmills were developed in the lower reaches of a river, with the logs floated down to them by log drivers. In the broader, slower stretches of a river, the logs might be bound together into timber rafts. In the smaller, wilder stretches of a river where rafts couldn't get through, masses of individual logs were driven down the river like huge herds of cattle. ""Log floating"" in Sweden (timmerflottning) had begun by the 16th century, and 17th century in Finland (tukinuitto). The total length of timber-floating routes in Finland was 40,000km.

The log drive was one step in a larger process of lumber-making in remote places. In a location with snowy winters, the yearly process typically began in autumn when a small team of men hauled tools upstream into the timbered area, chopped out a clearing, and constructed crude buildings for a logging camp. In the winter when things froze, a larger crew moved into the camp and proceeded to cut trees, cutting the trunks into 5-metre (16 ft) lengths, and hauling the logs with oxen or horses over iced trails to the riverbank. There the logs were decked onto ""rollways."" In spring when snow thawed and water levels rose, the logs were rolled into the river, and the drive commenced.
To ensure that logs drifted freely along the river, men called ""log drivers"" or ""river pigs"" were needed to guide the logs. The drivers typically divided into two groups. The more experienced and nimble men comprised the ""jam"" crew or ""beat"" crew. They watched the spots where logs were likely to jam, and when a jam started, tried to get to it quickly and dislodge the key logs before many logs stacked up. If they didn't, the river would keep piling on more logs, forming a partial dam which could raise the water level. Millions of board feet of lumber could back up for miles upriver, requiring weeks to break up, with some timber lost if it was shoved far enough into the shallows. When the jam crew saw a jam begin, they rushed to it and tried to break it up, using peaveys and possibly dynamite. This job required some understanding of physics, strong muscles, and extreme agility. The jam crew was an exceedingly dangerous occupation, with the drivers standing on the moving logs and running from one to another. Many drivers lost their lives by falling and being crushed by the logs.

Each crew was accompanied by an experienced boss often selected for his fighting skills to control the strong and reckless men of his team. The overall drive was controlled by the ""walking boss"" who moved from place to place to coordinate the various teams to keep logs moving past problem spots. Stalling a drive near a saloon often created a cascade of drunken personnel problems.
A larger group of less experienced men brought up the rear, pushing along the straggler logs that were stuck on the banks and in trees. They spent more time wading in icy water than balancing on moving logs. They were called the ""rear crew."" Other men worked with them from the bank, pushing logs away with pike poles. Others worked with horses and oxen to pull in the logs that had strayed furthest out into the flats.
Bateaux ferried log drivers using pike poles to dislodge stranded logs while maneuvering with the log drive. A wannigan was a kitchen built on a raft which followed the drivers down the river. The wannigan served four meals a day to fuel the men working in cold water. It also provided tents and blankets for the night if no better accommodations were available. A commissary wagon carrying clothing, plug tobacco and patent medicines for purchase by the log drivers was also called a wangan. The logging company wangan train, called a Mary Anne, was a caravan of wagons pulled by four- or six-horse teams where roads followed the river to transport the tents, blankets, food, stoves, and tools needed by the log drivers.
For log drives, the ideal river would have been straight and uniform, with sharp banks and a predictable flow of water. Wild rivers were not that, so men cut away the fallen trees that would snag logs, dynamited troublesome rocks, and built up the banks in places. To control the flow of water, they built ""flash dams"" or ""driving dams"" on smaller streams, so they could release water to push the logs down when they wanted.
Each timber firm had its own mark which was placed on the logs, called an ""end mark"". Obliterating or altering a timber mark was a crime. At the mill the logs were captured by a log boom, and the logs were sorted for ownership before being sawn.
Log drives were often in conflict with navigation, as logs would sometimes fill the entire river and make boat travel dangerous or impossible.
Floating logs down a river worked well for the most desirable pine timber, because it floated well. But hardwoods were more dense, and weren't buoyant enough to be easily driven, and some pines weren't near drivable streams. Log driving became increasingly unnecessary with the development of railroads and the use of trucks on logging roads.  However, the practice survived in some remote locations where such infrastructure did not exist. Most log driving in the US and Canada ended with changes in environmental legislation in the 1970s. Some places, like the Catalan Pyrenees, still retain the practice as a popular holiday celebration once a year.
In Sweden legal exemptions for log driving were eliminated in 1983. ""The last float in southern Sweden was in the 1960s, with the floating era in the rest of the country ending completely with the last of the many log drives in the Klarälven river in 1991.""


== Popular culture ==

The contemporary logrolling contest, Birling, is a demonstration of skills originally devised by log drivers.
Inclusive description of a complex assortment as ""the whole Mary Anne"" derives from the colorful characters of wangan caravans which periodically transformed quiet rural communities with the excitement of a passing log drive.
In Canada, ""The Log Driver's Waltz"" is a popular folk song which boasts about a log driver's dancing skills.
The version of the Canadian one-dollar bank note issued in 1974 and withdrawn in 1989 featured a view of the Ottawa River with log driving taking place in the foreground and Parliament Hill rising in the background. This banknote was part of the fourth series of banknotes released by the Bank of Canada entitled ""Scenes of Canada"". The logs depicted in this bank note may have been destined for a half dozen pulp, paper and sawmills near the Chaudière Falls immediately upstream from Parliament Hill, or for other mills further downstream.
An Englishman may have observed loggers loitering in Bangor, Maine when he reported in 1801: ""His habits in the forest and the [river] voyage all break up the system of persevering industry and substitute one of alternate toil and indolence, hardship and debauch; and in the alteration, indolence and debauch will inevitably be indulged in the greatest possible proportion.""
In the first chapter of The Cider House Rules (1985), John Irving briefly describes a 1930s log drive.
Harry Brandelius’ 1950s Swedish song Flottarkärlek tells the story of a young log driver.
Teuvo Pakkala’s 1899 Finnish play Tukkijoella started the so-called ‘log driver romantics’ phase, resulting in several movies and books about log drivers’ lives.
The song Breakfast in Hell by Slaid Cleaves tells the tale of the death of Sandy Grey, a driver in Ontario.
In the first four chapters of John Irving's novel Last Night in Twisted River (2009), the hard and dangerous life of log drivers in New Hampshire is described in detail.
Canadian band Great Big Sea included the song ""River Driver"" on their album The Hard and the Easy, about a log driver from Newfoundland.

La Vetta,"La Vetta (or The Ice Queen) is a symbolist work by Cesare Saccaggi. It was first shown at the 10th International Art Exhibition in Venice in 1912. It is currently kept in the painting gallery of the Cassa di Risparmio Foundation in Tortona.


== Description ==
The picture shows a human figure, with an edelweiss. In the background, snow-covered mountains can be seen. An exhausted young man tries to hold on to this figure. This scene is typical for the German philiosophy of the 19th century. It illustrates the concept of effort (""Streben""). The main figure shows the unattainable goal. The young man symbolisess the eternal desire to surpass himself.

International tourism,"International tourism is tourism that crosses national borders. Globalisation has made tourism a popular global leisure activity. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people ""traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes"". The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 500,000 people are in flight at any one time.

In 2010, international tourism reached US$919B, growing 6.5% over 2009, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.7%. In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide. By 2016 that number had risen to 1,235 million, producing 1,220  billion USD in destination spending. The COVID-19 crisis had significant negative effects on international tourism significantly slowing the overall increasing trend.
International tourism has significant impacts on the environment, exacerbated in part by the problems created by air travel but also by other issues, including wealthy tourists bringing lifestyles that stress local infrastructure, water and trash systems among others.


== History ==
As a result of the late-2000s recession, international travel demand suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. This negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.


=== COVID-19 ===
Some people have taken advantage of airlines drastically reducing their fares to travel for leisure despite multiple warnings to remain at home, along with two-week self-quarantine requirements upon arrival or return from travel. A number of college students tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from traditional spring break destinations such as the Florida beaches, South Padre Island, and Cabo San Lucas. Many tourism venues such as museums, visitor centers, restaurants and hotels mandated COVID-19 vaccination for their staff or visitors. Research has shown that tourists have varying levels of belief on COVID-19 vaccination in terms of its effectiveness and side effects, which have impact on the preferences of tourists to preference to visit or use ""vaccinated venues"".
Together with a decreased willingness to travel, the restrictions have had a negative economic impact on the travel sector in those regions. A possible long-term impact has been a decline of business travel and international conferencing, and the rise of their virtual, online equivalents. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.
In Cambodia, Foreign arrivals in March 2020 fell by 65% year-on-year. Angkor Wat, usually crowded with thousands of tourists per day, was left almost deserted, with an average of 22 ticket sales per day for the whole Angkor National Park during April 2020. In Vietnam, Foreign arrivals in April 2020 fell by 98% year-on-year.
Tourism in Hawaii went on hiatus.  Tourist arrivals in Hawaii down nearly 100% in April 2020 and its 14-day mandatory quarantine kept tourism low. A number of tourists who came to the state but did not follow the quarantine were arrested. In June 2020, Hawaii had still not set a date for reopening to out-of-state tourism. As of 16 June, the quarantine would be lifted for inter-island tourism. Florida tourism had a year-over-year 11% drop in the first quarter of 2020. During the pandemic in Door County, Wisconsin, hundreds of seasonal residents relocated to the county earlier in the spring than they typically do. In 2020, staycations became popular in the United States, where most people spent their vacation time at or close to home. Most vacation travel was done by car, as gas prices are low and many people prefer to wait to the last minute to plan trips due to uncertainties. There were sharp declines in travel by air, cruise ship, bus and rail.
In Australia, Tourism bodies have suggested that the total economic cost to the sector, as of 11 February 2020, would be A$4.5 billion. Casino earnings are expected to fall. At least two localities in Australia, Cairns and the Gold Coast, have reported already lost earnings of more than $600 million. The Australian Tourism Industry Council (ATIC) called on the Government of Australia for financial support especially in light of the large number of small businesses affected. In March, national travel agency Flight Centre has indefinitely closed 100 stores throughout Australia, due to significantly lower demand for travel. It also suffered a 75% decline in share price, and announced that 6,000 staff would be made redundant or placed on unpaid leave globally.


== Rankings ==


=== Total volume of cross-border tourist travel ===
International tourist arrivals reached 1.035 billion in 2012, up from over 996 million in 2011, and 952 million in 2010. In 2011 and 2012, international travel demand continued to recover from the losses resulting from the late-2000s recession, where tourism suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007. The negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.


=== World's top tourism destinations ===

In 2019, there were 1.460 billion international tourist arrivals worldwide, with a growth of 3.7% as compared to 2018. The World Tourism Organization reports the following ten destinations as the most visited in terms of the number of international travelers in 2019.


=== International tourism receipts ===
The World Tourism Organization reports that international tourism receipts were US$1.7 trillion in 2018, an increase in real terms of 4% over 2017. The top ten tourism earners in 2018 were:

Xylotomy,"Xylotomy is the preparation of small slivers of wood for examination under a microscope, often using a microtome.
It is useful for providing forensic evidence in some criminal cases where finding a fragment of wood on an individual and matching it to a weapon used in a crime would be helpful.  During the trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, accused in the Lindbergh kidnapping during the 1930s, the xylotomist Arthur Koehler was able to provide crucial evidence by linking a piece of pine from a ladder used in a kidnapping to one particular factory whose machinery was defective, and from there to one particular lumberyard.  Koehler searched for eighteen months for the yard, and presented his evidence dramatically in court by presenting the court with a chalk rubbing of the samples, which he made there and then, demonstrating that they were identical.  He also matched other pieces of the ladder to a chisel used to create the joists, missing from the defendant's tool chest, and to a missing plank from the suspect's attic floor.
It may also be useful in forestry studies.  Identifying the species of a piece of wood is not always easy, in which case a xylotheque may provide samples with which the xylotomist can compare his own.  Xylotomy may be carried out by a forensic biologist.  People who specialize in xylotomy are rare.  The public have been known to confuse it with someone who plays the xylophone and they do not tend to take much interest in the subject.

Exotheology,"The term ""exotheology"" was coined in the 1960s or early 1970s for the examination of theological issues as they pertain to extraterrestrial intelligence. It is primarily concerned with either conjecture about possible theological beliefs that extraterrestrials might have, or how our own theologies would be influenced by evidence of and/or interaction with extraterrestrials.
One of the main themes of exotheology is applying the concept of extraterrestrials who are sentient, and more to the point, endowed with a soul,  as a thought experiment to the examination of a given theology, mostly Christian theology, occasionally also Jewish theology.


== Christianity ==
The Christian writer C. S. Lewis, in a 1950s article  in the Christian Herald contemplated the possibility of the Son of God incarnating on extraterrestrial worlds, or else that God could devise an entirely distinct plan of salvation for extraterrestrial communities from the one for humans.
Lutheran theologian Ted Peters (2003) said that the questions raised by the possibility of extraterrestrial life are not new to Christian theology and do not pose, as said by other authors, a threat for Christian dogma. Peters says that medieval theology had frequently considered the question of ""what if God had created many worlds?"", as had the earlier Church Fathers in discussion of the Antipodes.
The Catholic theologian Corrado Balducci often discussed the question in Italian popular media, and in 2001 published a statement UFOs and Extraterrestrials - A Problem for the Church?.
In a 2008 statement, José Gabriel Funes, head of the Vatican Observatory, said
""Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can't put limits on God's creative freedom"".
Smaller denominations also have similar treatments in passing in their key writings: Christian Science and the Course in Miracles treat extraterrestrials as effectively brother spiritual beings in a non-absolute physical experience, the founder of the former writing, ""The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings,..."", and Emanuel Swedenborg wrote, ""Anyone with a sound intellect can know from many considerations that there are numerous worlds with people on them. Rational thought leads to the conclusion that massive bodies such as the planets, some of which are larger than our own earth, are not empty masses created merely to wander aimlessly around the sun, and shine with their feeble light on one planet. No, they must have a much greater purpose than that. ... What would one planet be to God, who is infinite, and for whom thousands, or even tens of thousands of planets, all full of inhabitants, would be such a trifling matter as to be almost nothing?""


== Judaism ==
Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, who was also a physicist, was inclined toward the belief in extraterrestrial life, citing Jewish authorities including medieval philosopher Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Ohr Hashem 4:2) and 18th century kabbalist Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Horowitz (Sefer HaBris). Kaplan says, ""We therefore find the basic thesis of the Sefer HaBris supported by a number of clear-cut statements by our Sages. There may even be other forms of intelligent life in the universe, but such life forms do not have free will, and therefore do not have moral responsibility""—at least in the same sense as human beings.
Rabbi Kaplan also cites Judges 5:23 (""Cursed is Meroz...""), about which Rashi, the foremost medieval commentator said, ""Some say [Meroz] was a planet, and some say [Meroz] was a prominent person who was near the battle area and yet did not come [to intervene]."" 
Rabbi Norman Lamm, former chancellor of Yeshiva University, also wrote on this subject, saying that if the existence of extraterrestrial life should be confirmed, religious scholars must revise previous assumptions to the contrary. He, too, does not rule out this possibility from an Orthodox Jewish point of view.
Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik is said to have remarked that life on other planets would only reflect God's greatness, which exceeds mortal understanding, while not contradicting the role of the Jewish people to heed the Torah and in so doing to perform God's will here on earth.


== Islam ==
Depending on the suras cited, the Quran of Islam appears to leave open the door to the idea of extraterrestrials, as in 27:65, situated similarly on par with humans subject to a divine judgment leading toward a heaven or hell as reward or punishment for the deeds of one's life.

Fog,"Fog is a meteorological phenomenon.  It is stratus clouds on the surface of the Earth.  Fog may appear on land or sea and it usually lowers visibility (makes it hard to see very far).  When the air chills, moisture will turn to fog.
Fog is made up of tiny water droplets or, in very cold conditions, ice crystals. When seen on a high speed camera, (a special camera that takes many frames and can view videos at very low speed) it looks like hundreds of small water droplets moving through the air. These water droplets make up the fog or mist. 
There are many types of fog, classified according to what makes the condensation. They include evaporation fog, advection fog, radiation fog, and upslope fog. The thickness of fog varies depending on the atmosphere, temperature, weather and location.

Greenhouse effect,"The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere (the air around the Earth) trap infrared radiation. This makes the planet become warmer, similar to the way a greenhouse becomes warmer. 
The most important greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are: water vapor, carbon dioxide(CO2), and methane. When there is more greenhouse gas in the air, the air holds more heat. This is why more greenhouse gases cause climate change and global warming.
The greenhouse effect is natural. It is important for life on Earth. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would be around –18 or –19 degrees Celsius (0 or 1 degree Fahrenheit). Earth would be locked in an ice age. Because of the greenhouse effect, the Earth's actual average temperature is 14 degrees Celsius (57 degrees Fahrenheit). 
The problem is that recently, the greenhouse effect has become stronger. This is because humans have been burning large amounts of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it has caused the planet to warm over the past 150 years.

About 10,000 years ago, before people started burning large amounts of fossil fuels, there were 260 to 280 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, but now there is over 400 ppm. Most scientists say that having 350 ppm or less is safe for the environment and that species on the planet can adapt to this level.  Higher levels can make severe problems for animal and marine life that are already being seen today, such as ocean acidification.
The greenhouse effect was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824. Mars, Venus and other planets with atmospheres also have greenhouse effects. The effect on Venus is especially strong because Venus has so much CO2. This is why Venus is hotter than Mercury, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. The first person to predict that carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels (and other combustion processes) could cause global warming was Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius.

Blue lava,"Blue lava, also known as (Indonesian: Api Biru), and simply referred to as blue fire or sulfur fire, is a phenomenon that occurs when sulfur burns. It is an electric-blue flame that has the illusory appearance of lava. Despite the name, the phenomenon is actually a sulfuric fire that resembles the appearance of lava, rather than actual lava from a volcanic eruption. The most well-documented of these fires occur on Indonesia's Kawah Ijen volcano, where they regularly burn.


== Characteristics ==
""Blue lava"" is an electric-blue fire that burns when sulfur combusts, producing a neon-blue flame.  Sulfur burns when it comes into contact with hot air at temperatures above 360 °C (680 °F), which produces the energetic flames. Actual lava is red-orange in color, given its temperature. Truly-blue lava would require temperatures of at least 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), from Planck's law, which is much higher than any lava can naturally achieve on the surface of the Earth.
The most famous of these fires occur regularly on Indonesia's Kawah Ijen volcano, on the island of Java, which has some of the highest levels of sulfur in the world and is also a site of sulfur mining. Due to the occurrence of the flames, Kawah Ijen has also been nicknamed ""the Blue Volcano"". The crater of Kawah Ijen is the world's largest blue flame area. Kawah Ijen has large amounts of sulfur deposits and fumaroles, and the high temperatures from the underground volcanic heat frequently combusts the sulfur on the surface of the volcano, producing the blue fires. When sulfur from within the volcano breaches the surface, it can reach temperatures up to 600 °C (1,112 °F), and the sulfur immediately encounters lower temperatures and pressures at the surface, which causes the sulfur to immediately ignite and erupt blue flames up to 5 metres (16 ft) into the air. At such high temperatures, the sulfur melts, which sometimes flows down the face of the volcano while carrying the flames with it, making it appear as if blue lava is flowing down the volcano. Due to the blue color of the flames, the fires are essentially visible only at nighttime, as they are otherwise indistinguishable during the daytime.
Another location in which ""blue lava"" is regularly seen is on Dallol mountain, in Ethiopia. The blue fires also occur in Yellowstone National Park during wildfires, when fires burn and melt the large amounts of sulfur present in the park, creating the appearance of burning blue rivers of lava during such events. Remnants of past episodes exist on the ground in the form of black lines, where fires have previously melted sulfur. Similar blue flames were observed on Kīlauea in May 2018, during the volcano's 2018 lower Puna eruption, when lava from the volcano burned methane that had been trapped underground.

Leap of faith,"A Leap of faith commonly refers to believing something that cannot be touched or proved by science, for which there is no evidence. Usually, the term is attributed to Søren Kierkegaard, even though he never really used it. According to Kierkegaard, such a leap involves circular reasoning, because a leap is made by faith.

A leap of faith is commonly associated with religious belief because many religions consider faith to be an essential element of piety.

IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants,"The International Astronomical Union at its XVIth General Assembly in Grenoble in 1976, accepted (Resolution No. 1) a whole new consistent set of astronomical constants recommended for reduction of astronomical observations, and for computation of ephemerides.  It superseded the IAU's previous recommendations of 1964 (see IAU (1964) System of Astronomical Constants), became in effect in the Astronomical Almanac from 1984 onward, and remained in use until the introduction of the IAU (2009) System of Astronomical Constants.  In 1994 the IAU recognized that the parameters became outdated, but retained the 1976 set for sake of continuity, but also recommended to start maintaining a set of ""current best estimates"".
this ""sub group for numerical standards"" had published a list, which included new constants (like those for relativistic time scales).
The system of constants was prepared by Commission 4 on ephemerides led by P. Kenneth Seidelmann (after whom asteroid 3217 Seidelmann is named).
At the time, a new standard epoch (J2000.0) was accepted; followed later by a new reference system with fundamental catalogue (FK5), and expressions for precession of the equinoxes,
and in 1979 by new expressions for the relation between Universal Time and sidereal time, and in 1979 and 1980 by a theory of nutation.  There were no reliable rotation elements for most planets, but a joint working group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements was installed to compile recommended values.


== Units ==
The IAU(1976) system is based on the astronomical system of units:

The astronomical unit of time is the day (D) of 86,400 SI seconds, which is close to the mean solar day of civil clock time.
The astronomical unit of mass is the mass of the Sun (S).
The astronomical unit of length is known as the astronomical unit (A or au), which in the IAU(1976) system is defined as the length for which the gravitational constant, more specifically the Gaussian gravitational constant k expressed in the astronomical units (i.e. k2 has units A3S−1D−2), takes the value of 0.017 202 098 95 .  This astronomical unit is approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.  The value of k is the angular velocity in radians per day (i.e. the daily mean motion) of an infinitesimally small mass that moves around the Sun in a circular orbit at a distance of 1 AU.

Celestial navigation,"Celestial navigation is a method of navigation where a person figures out their location and direction using the stars in the night sky. It has been used by sailors to help them find their way in the night. They look for familiar stars or constellations, which will help them find their way. 
Celestial navigation involves comparing the angle of certain stars to other stars and how high they are above the Earth's horizon. By doing this, a person can find their longitude.",0
Dynamic packaging,"Dynamic packaging is a method used in package holiday bookings to enable consumers to build their own package of flights, accommodation, and car rental instead of purchasing a pre-defined package. Dynamic packages differ from traditional package tours in that the pricing is always based on current availability, escorted group tours are rarely included, and trip-specific add-ons such as airport parking and show tickets are often available.  Dynamic packages are similar in that often the air, hotel, and car rates are available only as part of a package or only from a specific seller.  The term ""dynamic packaging"" is often used incorrectly to describe the less sophisticated process of interchanging various travel components within a package, however, this practice is more accurately described as ""dynamic bundling"".  True dynamic packaging demands the automated recombination of travel components based on the inclusion of rules that not only dictate the content of the package but also conditional pricing rules based on various conditions such as the trip characteristics, suppliers contributing components, the channel of distribution, and terms of sale.  Dynamic packages are primarily sold online, but online travel agencies will also sell by phone owing to the strong margins and high sale price of the product.
Dynamic packaging is dynamic at several levels. Firstly, inventory is sourced dynamically, meaning the dynamic packaging solution will source flights, accommodation and car rental components for the package in real-time. Secondly, these components are dynamically combined into packages. Thirdly, the package is dynamically priced and is usually given an opaque total price.


== Benefits ==
Dynamic packages are normally given a single, opaque price, meaning the wholesaler's cost of the individual components is hidden from the consumer. The wholesaler often obtains special package-only cost rates for travel components, such as negotiated fares for flights or special package rates for accommodation or car rental. These cost prices are typically significantly lower than the cost prices suppliers offer for the same products if they were to be sold as single components. Hence, the wholesaler will be able to offer the consumer a combined saving for the dynamic package, without reducing his own margins.
Opaque pricing of dynamic packages hide the price of the included components. This has several benefits. Suppliers of travel products often impose a minimum selling price for their products. For instance, a hotel might give the wholesaler a room at cost price X, but on the condition that the room is not sold for less than Y (hotels do this to prevent wholesalers from competing with themselves). With dynamic packaging, the customer is not presented with the room price, only the overall package price, so hotels typically allow the wholesaler to discount the (hidden) price of the hotel more.
Opaque pricing also has benefits for airlines. Airlines tend to increase their fares the closer you get to the departure date, even if there are many available seats. This is to ""train"" the consumers to book early, making it easier for the airline to do proper revenue management. If airlines were to dump their fares if a flight failed to fill up, then this would train the customers to wait until very close to departure before booking. This would make it virtually impossible for an airline to manage their fares (fares could then only be determined based on historical data and not based on current demand). Dynamic packaging allows an airline to get rid of distressed inventory at discounted fares, as the discounted fare is effectively hidden from the consumer.


== Preconditions ==
Dynamic Packaging is also often misunderstood since it requires that the provider of Dynamic Packaging be a wholesaler, who must also issue tickets, vouchers or other redeemable coupons in order to become a Dynamic Packager. Without an inventory management system, and a ticket, coupon or voucher issuing system to make the prices of the individual components appear as one price to the consumer and allow each travel service provider to know what rate to accept or charge the traveler; dynamic packaging does not work. Many travel retailers have mistakenly assumed they could provide dynamic packaging without an inventory management system, mark-up engine with business rules and a ticket issuing and resolution system.
The wholesaler must either directly control the inventory that is combined into packages or buy the package components up-front from other travel suppliers. This implies that dynamic packages (as with static packages) are always pre-paid by the customer.
The wholesaler would typically also require special discounted fares/rates from the travel suppliers. For car rental, the supplier (car rental company or intermediary) should ideally supply their price based on calendar days rather than hour-by-hour. Calendar day rates reduce the number of vehicle availability/pricing scans the wholesaler must make. For packages that include flights, the outbound arrival and return departure date/times determine the car rental pick-up and drop-off date/times. If car rental rates were by the hour they would differ for each flight option, hence the wholesaler would have to issue a vehicle availability search for each available flight, while with 24-hour rates one single vehicle availability search is enough to cater for all flight options.

The World Tourism Organization (UN Tourism) defines overtourism as ""the impact of tourism on a destination, or parts thereof, that excessively influences perceived quality of life of citizens and/or quality of visitor experiences in a negative way"". This definition shows how overtourism can be observed both among locals, who view tourism as a disruptive factor that increasingly burdens daily life, as well as visitors, who may regard high numbers of tourists as a nuisance.
The term was only used infrequently before 2017, but is now the most commonly used expression to describe the negative impacts ascribed to tourism.


== Characterisation ==

The growth of tourism can lead to conflicts between residents, commuters, day-visitors and overnight tourists. Although much attention is currently given to overtourism in cities, it can also be observed in rural destinations, or on islands. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) found that a perception of overcrowding can prompt local residents to protest against tourism. The excessive growth of visitors can lead to negative effect for local residents, especially during temporary or seasonal tourism peaks. Therefore, the carrying capacity of a tourist destination is also measured in terms of social carrying capacity, and the behaviour of the tourists.
Overtourism is sometimes incorrectly equated with mass tourism. Mass tourism entails large groups of tourists coming to the same destination. While this can lead to overtourism, there are many destinations that host millions of visitors, yet are not seen as suffering from overtourism (e.g., London). Tourists usually use infrastructure and services designed for residents. If the carrying capacity is exceeded of the infrastructure and services tourists need to use as well, the service provision focuses on the priorities of the tourists. Residents may be forced to use the service provision intended for tourists.
In the 1990s local residents in Spain, Greece, Malta, and France started to oppose mass tourism, which was perceived as Fordist. In rural areas of Latin America, environmental concerns were the key driver for rising discontent and social campaigns against tourist real estate developments. In Mexico and Central America vehement protests were triggered by tourist real estate speculation alongside the exploitation of workers, and even dispossession or displacement of local residents.
In 2017 Europe saw a wave of residents' protests in cities, including Barcelona, Venice, and Palma de Mallorca. The problems arising from overtourism began to be discussed in academic publications, but no commonly accepted definition of the phenomenon has been agreed on.


== Causes ==

Overtourism is observed mostly, but not exclusively, when the number of visitors to a destination, or parts thereof, grows rapidly in a short space of time. Also, it is most common in areas where visitors and residents share a physical space. In recent years, developments within tourism and outside of tourism have increased contact between residents and visitors and made the impacts of tourism more noticeable. In addition to the overall growth of tourist numbers, problems associated with overtourism have been exacerbated by the following developments:


=== Enablers of overtourism ===
Overtourism has developed into a widespread phenomenon. Governments and destination marketing organizations are attempting to address the problem. Enablers of overtourism include greater numbers of tourists, the affordability of travel, a mindset dominated by the wish for economic growth, short term focus on tourism, the competition for local services and amenities, and lack of control over tourist bookings.
There are currently more tourists than ever before in world history. In 1950 the number of international tourists was estimated to be 25 million. In 1963 Walter Christaller published on the negative effects of tourism. In 1987 Jost Krippendorf followed as international tourist travel increased. In 2016 tourists numbered over a billion, a 50-fold increase compared to 1950. Media coverage on overtourism has focused on Europe, which bears the brunt of tourism arrivals with 50 percent, and South East Asia, which sustains 25 percent of tourism arrivals. According to UNWTO there were 25 million international arrivals in 1950, which increased to 1.3 billion by 2017. The international tourism sector is expected to grow 3.3% annually, until 2030, a year at which point an expected 1.8 billion tourists will cross borders.


=== Factors contributing to overtourism ===

The rise of low-cost carriers (LCCs), the availability of inexpensive intercity bus service, and the popularity of cruise ship travel are assumed to have contributed to complaints about overtourism. In academic literature government policy, the ambitions of service providers in tourist destinations, as well as the influence of social media are considered enablers of overtourism.
Airbnb and similar online accommodation services can lead to an increase in tourists due to lower prices, compared to hotels or other establishments. There is also the issue of Airbnb's leading to fewer affordable housing opportunities for residents, increased rent prices, and loss of social community within neighborhoods. 
The experience economy and changing lifestyle patterns have been blamed for the increased use of leisure facilities, contributed to a monoculture of hospitality facilities.


== Examples ==

As of 2017, several media outlets published lists of destinations that are not recommended because of an excessive number of tourists.


=== Antarctica ===
According to CNN, environmentalists are concerned about the effect of tourism on Antarctica, which steadily increased during the 2010s. The total number of visitors to Antarctica, as registered by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) in the 2023-24 summer season was 122,072. Cruise-only vessels (i.e. vessels not putting travelers on shore) accounted for 35% of the visitors.  


=== Aruba ===
In Aruba, the chemical Oxybenzone in sunscreen is harming coral reefs and marine life. In 2019 a proposed law called ""Choose Zero"" was introduced, which includes a ban on importing, selling, or distributing single-use plastic products and products containing Oxybenzone.


=== Austria ===
Hallstatt in 2020 had 780 citizens and more than 10,000 visitors a day, primarily arriving via tour bus, stopping briefly for photographs, and moving on quickly. Citizens complained about tourists entering homes and private gardens to take photos, or applauding funerals at the churchyard. In 2020, the town implemented a system to limit entry of buses.


=== Bhutan ===
Bhutan instituted a US$200 to US$250 charge per day for tourists because of overtourism concerns.


=== China ===
The Great Wall of China has been damaged by overtourism.


=== Croatia ===
Dubrovnik became so overtouristed by 2017 that UNESCO considered removing it from the World Heritage Site list. The city capped the number of visitors allowed to climb its ramparts and as of 2017 was planning to limit the number of cruise ships that could dock. In 2020 they were considering limiting the number of new restaurants allowed to open.


=== Ecuador ===
The Galápagos Islands were included on Fodor's 2017 list of places not to go because of environmental damage caused by overtourism. As of 2017 visitors are required to hire a guide.


=== France ===

In Paris, workers at the Louvre went on strike over what they said were dangerously overcrowded conditions.


=== Greece ===
In Santorini cruise ship visitors have been capped at 8000 per day due to overtourism after years in which the island of 15,000 residents was receiving up to 18,000 tourists per day.


=== Germany ===
The Zugspitze has been plagued by overtourism, especially because of day trippers arriving via gondola.
The European Alps experience a raise in accidents and deaths, since many tourists underestimate the difficulty of mountain routes, and go mountaineering with insufficient equipment or low fitness and stamina.


=== Hawai'i ===
In Hawaii the degradation of corals has been shown to worsen in areas with higher concentration of tourists.


=== Iceland ===
The Fjaðrárgljúfur area was closed after the music video for Justin Bieber's I'll Show You made it so popular the government needed to improve infrastructure. Overall there is a challenge that Iceland has been facing around protecting their environment with the increase in tourism to the country. Overuse of natural areas can cause long-lasting and possibly permanent damage to vegetation, soils, and the landscape. An influx of visitors can also cause congestion which can harm the experience. With the rapid growth, there is also a lack of infrastructure on the island to fully support the increase in tourism, as well as the already present resident of the island, causing other issues such as traffic on roads that can be difficult to travel.


=== India ===
In 2019 the Taj Mahal started fining visitors who stay more than three hours. CNN in 2017 called the crowds ""relentless"".


=== Indonesia ===
Bali was, in 2020, planning a US$10 tourist tax.


=== Iran ===
Abyaneh's overtourism is often reported on.


=== Iraqi Kurdistan ===
Iraqi Kurdistan is the most toured part of Iraq, especially during Newroz. Tourists come from all around Iraq and the world for Newroz. In Duhok, 3 people were arrested for planning to burn 200 tires for the Newroz fire in 2022. In Akre, a city famous for its Newroz celebrations, some locals decided to burn wooden torches instead of tires.


=== Italy ===

Venice has faced declining population because of overtourism. In 2019 Forbes called it one of the ""most notably overtouristed destinations"" in the world. CNN in 2017 called the crowds ""overbearing."" The city in 2018 tested the use of turnstiles in St. Mark's Square to control the number of visitors. In 2020 the daily tourist tax was US$11.
Capri in 2018 tested ways to limit day tourism. Cinque Terre had 2.5 million visitors in 2015, and local authorities sought to limit visitors to 1.5 million in 2016, but a backlash resulted in this being walked back. CNN in 2017 said that day tourists from cruise ships, who tour for a few hours and don't spend money, are blamed for environmental damage. Officials in Rome made it illegal to sit on the Spanish Steps, with fines of up to US$448, due to damage caused by tourists.
In the 2010s Pragser Wildsee became an area of overtourism, receiving up to 17,000 visitors on a single summer day in 2020; as of 2023, there were vehicle access restrictions.
The government of Florence is currently seeking to ban new short-term rental properties in the city's historic center, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city's administration argues that the increased availability of short-term rentals through platforms such as Airbnb, which cater to tourists, have made housing inaccessible for local residents.


=== Japan ===
Kyoto officials instituted a US$92 fine for tourists taking photographs of geisha without their permission, and prohibited tourists from visiting some alleys. 
The end of COVID-19-related travel restrictions and a weakening Japanese yen have fueled a record-breaking surge in foreign tourism. In response to a surge in foreign tourists at Mount Fuji, Yamanashi Prefecture has set a cap of daily climbers at 4,000 people and began charging an entrance fee of ¥2,000. Also in Yamanashi Prefecture, a mesh barrier was set up to block a view of Mount Fuji behind a Lawson convenience store in Fujikawaguchiko due to tourist-caused disturbances in the area. Tokyo's Shibuya ward restricted Halloween and New Year's Eve gatherings at Shibuya Crossing (which had not been held since 2019 due to COVID-19 and safety issues) in 2023 due to issues with public intoxication caused by overtourism, and introduced an ordinance in 2024 which prohibits public alcohol consumption from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. year-round (expanding from late-October and late-December). 
As of 2024 some Japanese officials have considered instituting a two-tiered pricing system which would have foreign tourists pay more than residents at certain tourist attractions to counter the effects of overtourism.


=== Nepal ===
Mount Everest has become so overtouristed that climbers die of altitude sickness because of the delays caused by overcrowding. As of 2020 the Nepalese government was planning to limit permits to those who had climbed another Nepalese peak 21,325 feet (6,500 m).


=== Netherlands ===
Amsterdam instituted a daily tourist tax in 2019, eliminated official tours of the Red Light District in 2020, and launched a ""Stay Away"" marketing campaign.


=== Peru ===

As of 2019, Peru limits visitors to Machu Picchu to 5000 per day, but UNESCO believes the limit should be halved. Starting in 2014 foreign tourists were required to hire a guide. In 2020 the site was planning to issue 5,940 tickets per day, which is more than twice the 2,500 UNESCO recommends to preserve the ruins.


=== Portugal ===
Sintra suffers from long queues, pollution, traffic, and a lack of grocery stores and pharmacies due to receiving 5,000 visitors a day for attractions such as Pena Palace.


=== Spain ===
In Barcelona protesters have demonstrated in tourist beaches and other tourist-heavy neighborhoods and anti-tourist graffiti has appeared. By 2013, 9,000,000 visitors were touring Park Güell annually, and officials limited entry to the park to 800 an hour. The New Yorker said, ""Park Güell’s shift from a shared public space into a cultural zone occupied almost exclusively by tourists is understood by some worried residents of Barcelona as a story about the prospective fate of the city itself."" According to Albert Arias, a geographer with the Barcelona government, the selling of tickets was ""a very bad solution,"" that ""is acknowledging a problem by fencing off public space."" Airbnb has contributed to overtourism, with in some sections of town experiencing a 45% decline in resident population between 2007 and 2019 due to investors purchasing properties to use as short-term rentals via the platform. By 2017 tourism had become a top concern among city officials, with a survey showing 60% of residents believed Barcelona had ""reached or exceeded"" its capacity to accommodate tourism. In 2020 Barcelona was planning to limit cruise ships. In April 2020 a proposal for radical change in the organisation of the city, the Manifesto for the Reorganisation of the city after COVID-19, was published in Barcelona by architecture and urban theorist Massimo Paolini, signed by 160 academics and 300 architects. The Manifesto is radically critical towards the touristification and commodification of the city, proposing to: ""eliminate cruise ships"", ""maintain the current dimensions of the airport"", ""stimulate touristic degrowth"", and ""eliminate any investment to promote the 'Barcelona brand'"".
Other overtouristed areas in Spain include the Canary Islands, Malaga, Mallorca, and Alicante.


=== Thailand ===
Maya Bay was closed to the public after overtourism caused environmental issues. Ao Phang Nga National Park was listed in 2017 in Fodor's list of places not to go in 2018 because of overtourism.


=== United Kingdom ===
In Scotland, the Isle of Skye advised visitors not to come unless they had overnight lodging booked.
In England in 2024, the tourist board of Thanet Council, which governs a popular tourist area in Kent, suggested that the council should levy a tourist tax, but it was refused.


=== Vietnam ===
In Hanoi in October 2019, a train had to make an emergency stop because of tourists on the tracks taking selfies.


== Taking action against overtourism ==

In September 2018, the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) published a report on overtourism and how to deal with it. The report highlights the importance of looking at tourism in a local context and details 11 strategies to deal with overtourism:

Increase the physical dispersion of crowds among different attractions within a city/destination;
Increase the temporal dispersion of tourists (e.g., by encouraging off-season visits);
Promote new and special-interest itineraries and attractions;
Make effective use of regulations on tourism;
Tailor activities to specific segments of the tourism market;
Ensure that the communities and residents benefit from tourism;
Create experiences beneficial to both tourists and residents;
Expand infrastructure;
Involve local residents in tourism policymaking;
Communicate with tourists about the potential impacts of tourism on communities;
Use data to monitor and respond to problems related to overtourism.
The consultancy firm McKinsey & Company suggests that to prevent overtourism one must focus on four priorities:

Build a comprehensive fact base and update it regularly.
Establish a sustainable-growth strategy through rigorous, long-term planning.
Involve all sections of society—commercial, public, and social.
Find new sources of funding.
In addition, systematic public-relations and communication is essential. Goals, measures, successes and failures of local tourism management must be made transparent to the inhabitants so that all relevant institutions become involved.


== Criticism of the phrase overtourism ==
There is no agreement as to when the phrase was coined and by whom. The first known use of ""over-tourism"" was in a 1986 article by Max Börlin in 1986 where he noted that: Like over-fishing, over-tourism can deplete the natural resource on which tourism depends, with resulting heavy hidden costs. Other scholars point to an article by journalist Freya Petersen in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 December 2001.
However, overtourism only became a widely used phrase in 2016, after it gained significant momentum after a Skift, travel industry news and research company, article. Skift's use of the term brought global attention to a growing problem of perceptions of excessive tourism, sparking conversations about how to manage tourism more sustainably. In 2018, following greater use of the word, Oxford Dictionary named 'overtourism' as one of its 2018 Words of the Year. This followed a campaign from The Daily Telegraph for the word to be recognised in its annual list.
When Michael O' Regan, PhD, a lecturer of tourism at Glasgow Caledonian University, posted an article he wrote about why people should stop using the word ""overtourism"" and the issues he sees with its usage in 2023, Skift wrote an article entitled 'It Is Time to Ditch the Phrase 'Overtourism.'
Rafat argues that: ""There are an increasing number of professionals pointing out 'overtourism' is not a useful analytical concept for measuring mismanagement and directing attention only towards tourists, rather than facilitators of tourism, such as policymakers and license providers. Destinations are trying to move beyond overtourism and look for other ways to talk about complex tourism issues without just blaming tourists for all the ills.""
Dr. O'Regan argues that overtourism is made up word, or a discursive formation, like ""immigration crisis"" or ""welfare dependency"", which frames tourism as a crisis or threat, and fuels debates over border control, degrowth and management of tourists. Based on a Twitter social network analysis, O'Regan found the #overtourism network is held together by a small number of experts, who play a key role in presenting, distributing and circulating information about the topic.

Jewish art,"Jewish art, or the art of the Jewish people, encompasses a diverse range of creative endeavors, spanning from ancient Jewish art to contemporary Israeli art. Jewish art encompasses the visual plastic arts, sculpture, painting, and more, all influenced by Jewish culture, history, and religious beliefs.
Jewish artistic expression traces back to the art of the ancient Israelites in the Land of Israel, where it originated and evolved during the Second Temple Period, influenced by various empires. This artistic tradition underwent further development during the Mishnaic and Talmudic eras, reflecting cultural and religious shifts within Jewish communities. With the dispersion of Jews across the globe, known as the Jewish diaspora, artistic production persisted throughout the millennia, adapting to diverse cultural landscapes while retaining distinct Jewish themes and motifs.
Until the emancipation, Jewish art was mostly centered around religious practices and rituals. Following the emancipation in the early modern period, Jewish artists, notably in Europe began to explore different themes, with different levels of connection to religious art. Notably, Jews in France, some of whom from fleeing from Eastern Europe, produced at times modernist art of completely secular nature. Later in the first half of the 20th century, a group composed mainly of these Eastern European Jews fleeing from persecution were known as the School of Paris.
From the mid to late 20th century, following The Holocaust and the immigration of Jews to modern Israel, Israel re-emerged as a center of Jewish art while Europe declined in its importance as a center of Jewish culture.


== Pre-Second Temple period ==

Prior to the First Temple Period and throughout its duration, literary sources point to the existence of craftsmanship which could be considered both art in its restrictive sense and natively Jewish. This was largely related to matters of ritual, such as the decoration of the Tabernacle, and the Temple that replaced it. Within this context, a number of figurative characters were present, such as the cherubs of the Ark of the Covenant and of the Solomonic Holy of Holies, and the twelve bronze oxen which formed the base of the Molten Sea. Artifacts bearing plastic depictions, such as the plaques unearthed in King Ahab's ""House of Ivory"" in Samaria and Israelite seals found in many locations in the land of Israel, appear to be influenced by Phoenician, Assyrian or Egyptian styles.


== Second Temple period and late antiquity ==
In the Second Temple period, Jewish art was heavily influenced by the Biblical injunction against graven images, leading to a focus on geometric, floral, and architectural motifs rather than figurative or symbolic representations. This artistic restraint was a response to the Hellenistic cultural pressures that threatened Jewish religious practices, notably the imposition of idolatry. Symbolic elements like the menorah and the shewbread table were sparingly used, primarily reflecting their significance in priestly duties.
However, the rise of Christianity and its establishment as the dominant religion of the Roman Empire marked a turning point in Jewish artistic expression. This period, known as Late Antiquity, witnessed Jewish communities gradually incorporating symbolic motifs into their synagogal and funerary art. The expansion of these symbols beyond the menorah and the shewbread table to include other ritual objects and emblems signified a broader expression of Jewish identity. This shift in cultural representation aimed to affirm Jewish faith and community following the rise of Christian dominance in the Mediterranean region, making symbols like the menorah emblematic of national identity as well as religious faith.
The menorah, initially a representation of priestly duties in the Second Temple, evolved into a central symbol of Jewish identity, especially after the Temple's destruction. Its depiction in Jewish art, ranging from synagogue mosaics to catacombs, signified not only the religious importance of the Temple but also served as a distinguishing marker of Jewish places of worship and burial. Scholars debate the menorah's symbolism, with interpretations ranging from its seven branches representing divine light, the seven planets, or the days of the week, reflecting its integral role in both daily rituals and as a symbol of Judaism itself.
The shewbread table, alongside other ritual objects such as the lulav, etrog, shofar, and flask, also played significant roles in Jewish art, marking the continuation of Temple traditions in diaspora communities. These objects, alongside depictions of the Temple, the Ark of the Scrolls, and the Ark of the Covenant, are part of an array of symbols used by Jewish communities to express and maintain their religious and cultural identity.


== Medieval Jewish art ==

During the medieval period (roughly the 5th to 15th centuries), Jewish communities continued to produce works of Jewish art, with most of the art centered around religious life, notably synagogues and religious texts.  Jewish scholars and texts, including works by luminaries like Rashi and Maimonides, often featured illustrations, some of which were crafted by artists who also served Christian clients, with notable connections between Jewish and Christian artists. The Florentine artist Mariano del Buono and the Master of the Barbo Missal, known for their work for Christian patrons, also created significant Jewish pieces. Ritual objects such as Hanukkah lamps and kiddush cups, while prescribed by Jewish law, evolved in form and decoration over time, often mirroring the luxury items and aesthetic preferences of their Christian counterparts. This adaptability and integration are further evidenced in medieval synagogue architecture, which frequently borrowed elements from contemporary Christian buildings, as seen in the synagogues in Central Europe such as those in Regensburg and Prague, which incorporate Gothic styles and motifs.


=== Interplay with Christianity ===

Artifacts from this era reflected the cultural exchanges between Jews and Christians, often as a result of intense theological dialogue and mutual curiosity between the two faiths. Christian scholars' efforts to learn Hebrew, challenge Jewish beliefs, or the portrayal of Jews and Jewish practices in Christian art with remarkable accuracy, suggest according to the Met, an interaction that was both intellectual and artistic. Objects such as the bronze menorah in the Cathedral of Essen and the head of King David from Notre-Dame de Paris are pointed to as examples of such artworks.


=== Illuminated manuscripts, Haggadot ===
Jewish manuscripts during the medieval period, notably in medieval Spain were illuminated with visual imagery. The Sarajevo Passover Haggadah, originating in Northern Spain in the 14th century is a notable example. The Golden Haggadah, originating in Catalonia exhibit Gothic and Italianate influences.


== Early modern period ==

Jewish art continued to be projected through sacred spaces and religious art. The exteriors of synagogues, particularly notable in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, were often unassuming, with plain facades that concealed their richly decorated interiors. This contrast underscored a Jewish philosophical notion wherein the sacred resides hidden within the mundane, a concept mirrored in the architectural dichotomy between the exterior and interior of these religious buildings. The internal beauty of these synagogues, adorned with detailed paintings and elaborate designs, was in stark contrast to their modest exteriors, a dichotomy driven by a desire to avoid provoking Christian antagonism and adhering to restrictions imposed by Christian authorities, such as limitations on the height of Jewish religious buildings.
Such restrictions led to innovative architectural solutions, including lowering the floors of synagogues to create a sense of increased interior height, a practice echoing the biblical verse ""I call to you from the depths, O Lord"" (Ps. 130:1). This approach not only adhered to the legal constraints but also enriched the spiritual ambiance of the synagogue space.
In Italy, synagogues were often discreetly integrated into the upper floors of tenements within ghettos, their exteriors giving no hint of the opulent Baroque interiors within. This concealment extended beyond the synagogues' architecture to their urban placement, with some synagogues in Central Europe being hidden behind courtyards or other buildings, as seen in Düsseldorf and Vienna. This strategic concealment served both to comply with external regulations and to safeguard the sanctity and security of the Jewish worship space.


== Following the emancipation ==

The Napoleonic code written under Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire liberated the Jews who had been restricted to ghettos and marginalized economically and politically. The Napoleonic Code, also initiated Jewish emancipation across Europe, granting religious freedom to Jews, Protestants, and Freemasons. This act of liberation extended to territories conquered by the First French Empire, where Napoleon abolished laws that confined Jews to ghettos and restricted their rights. By 1808, he further integrated French Judaism into the state, establishing the national Israelite Consistory alongside recognized Christian cults, thereby formally acknowledging Jewish communities within French society for the first time.
As Jews were emancipated and gained civil rights, they began to integrate into mainstream society and work in occupations limited to them beforehand, Jews could become mainstream artists and were increasingly influenced by the prevailing cultural and artistic movements of their time. These artists also began to create art beyond religious texts and spaces and engage in secular arts. This period also saw an increase in Jewish patronage of the arts.


=== Eastern Europe ===
Early critics like Majer Bałaban viewed Jewish art broadly, including any object that exhibited “features of Jewish creativity,” while Abram Efros contended that Jewish artists should be recognized within the national contexts of their residence, arguing, “Jewish artists belong to the art of the country where they live and work”. Following the emancipation, figures such as Maurycy Gottlieb blurred traditional boundaries, integrating Jewish themes into a broader Christian iconographic tradition, laying foundational elements for Jewish genre painting. The late 19th and early 20th centuries with the rise of Jewish nationalism added an ideological dimension to Jewish art, with Jewish genre painting used by some as medium for expressing  Zionist revival and the Jewish experience of exile. Religious art and architecture manifested also in wooden synagogues in Eastern Europe which would eventually be destroyed by the Nazis in the Second World war.
The works of artists such as Szmul Hirszenberg and Izidor Kaufmann showcased an interweaving of Jewish narratives with a universal moral vocabulary, drawing mainly on Christian allegories to depict Jewish suffering and resilience. Their art, while deeply rooted in Jewish experiences, mirrored the allegorical and dramatic modes prevalent in Christian painting, responding to the artistic and ideologies of the time. An example being Hirszenberg's works, such as ""Golus"" and ""Czarny Sztandar"" (The Black Banner, 1907, Jewish Museum, New York), used Christian allegories to communicate broader themes of exile, suffering, and redemption, embodying the tension between death and resurrection characteristic of Christian imagery.


== Modern period ==


=== The School of Paris ===

The École de Paris, (the School of Paris in French) is a term coined in 1925 by art critic André Warnod, said to represent a diverse group of artists, many of Jewish origin from Eastern Europe, who settled in Montparnasse, Paris. Many of these Jewish artists arrived in Paris seeking artistic education and having fled from persecution, particularly in Eastern Europe. The École de Paris included notable figures such as Marc Chagall, Jules Pascin, Chaïm Soutine, Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel, Amedeo Modigliani, and Abraham Mintchine. Their work often depicted Jewish themes and expressed deep emotional intensity, reflecting their experiences of discrimination, pogroms, and the upheavals of the Russian Revolution. The art of these artists, especially those of Eastern European origin is said to have reflected in expressionist works the plight and suffering of the Jewish people. Despite facing xenophobia and criticism from some quarters, these artists played a central role in the vibrant artistic community of Paris, frequenting cafes, communicated in Yiddish and contributed significantly to its status as the capital of the art world. The School of Paris ebbed away following the Nazi occupation of France and the Holocaust, during which several Jewish artists were murdered or died of disease. Several of the artists, such as Marc Chagall, dispersed to Israel and the United States.


==== In Israel ====
In Israel, the influence of the École de Paris persisted from the 1920s through the 1940s, with French art and especially French Jewish artists continuing to shape the Israeli art scene for decades. The return of École de Paris artist Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel to Pre-Independence Israel in 1925 and the establishment of the Histadrut Art Studio marked the beginning of this influence. His students, upon returning from Paris, further amplified the French artistic influence in Pre-Independence Israel. This period saw artists in Tel Aviv and Safed creating works that portrayed humanity and emotion, often with a dramatic and tragic quality reflective of Jewish experiences. Safed, one of the holy cities of Judaism, in particular, became a center for artists influenced by the École de Paris in the mid to late 20th century. Its mystical and romantic setting attracted artists like Moshe Castel and Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel, who sought to capture the city's spiritual essence and dynamic landscapes.


=== Israel ===

In the early 20th century the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in 1906 was founded by Boris Schatz, blending European Art Nouveau with local artistic traditions. This period also saw the emergence of modern art movements and a shift towards a more subjective artistic expression, challenging the traditional confines of Bezalel's artistic doctrine. With the establishment of studios such as the Histadrut art studio and exhibitions oriented toward modern art following the introduction of the influence of the École de Paris, Tel Aviv emerging as a cultural hub, in time replacing Jerusalem as the country's prominent art centre.
During the early 20th century, artists began to settle in Safed, leading to the establishment of the Artist's Quarter of Tzfat which catalyzed what is at times referred to as a ""golden age of art"" in the city, spanning the 1950s through the 1970s. This era also saw the rise of significant art movements such as the Canaanite and New Horizons movements, further diversified the Israeli art scene.

Glossolalia,"Glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, is speaking rapid speech-like syllables which cannot be understood. In some cases it is part of religious practice. Some consider it as a part of a sacred language. It is a common practice amongst Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity.


== Linguistics ==
In 1972 a linguist from the University of Toronto published an assessment of Pentecostal glossolalia. His assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private Christian meetings in Italy, the Netherlands, Jamaica, Canada and the US.
Samarin found that glossolalic speech is like human language in some respects. The speaker uses accent, rhythm, intonation and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units. Each unit is itself made up of syllables. The syllables are formed from consonants and vowels taken from a language known to the speaker:

It is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels... in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically... with variations in pitch, volume, speed and intensity.p120

Samarin found that the resemblance to human language was just on the surface. He concluded that glossolalia is ""only a facade of language"".p128 The syllable string did not form words, the stream of speech was not internally organized, and – most importantly of all – there was no systematic relationship between units of speech and concepts. Humans use language to communicate but glossolalia does not. Therefore, he concluded that glossolalia is not ""a specimen of human language because it is neither internally organized nor systematically related to the world man perceives"".p128 On the basis of his linguistic analysis, Samarin defined Pentecostal glossolalia as ""meaningless but phonologically structured human utterance, believed by the speaker to be a real language but bearing no systematic resemblance to any natural language, living or dead"".p2

Panentheism,"Panentheism is the belief that the universe is part of God. Followers believe that one or more gods are both part of the universe and greater than it. To some people, this is a very confusing concept (idea) and was first created by philosophers in the early centuries AD.
A famous philosopher who used the term was Baruch Spinoza.

Metal casting simulation,"Casting process simulation is a computational technique used in industry and metallurgy to model and analyze the metal-casting process. This technology allows engineers to predict and visualize the flow of molten metal, crystallization patterns, and potential defects in the casting before the start of the actual production process. By simulating the casting process, manufacturers can optimize mold design, reduce material consumption, and improve the quality of the final product.


== History ==

The theoretical foundations of heat conduction, critically important for casting simulation, were established by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier at the École polytechnique in Paris. His thesis ""Analytical Theory of Heat,"" awarded in 1822, laid the groundwork for all subsequent calculations of heat conduction and heat transfer in solid materials. Additionally, French physicist and engineer Claude-Louis Navier and Irish mathematician and physicist George Gabriel Stokes provided the foundations of fluid dynamics, which led to the development of the Navier-Stokes equations. Adolph Fick , working in the 19th century at the University of Zurich, developed the fundamental equations describing diffusion, published in 1855.
The beginning of simulation in casting started in the 1950s when V. Pashkis used analog computers to predict the movement of the crystallization front. The first use of digital computers to solve problems related to casting was carried out by Dr K. Fursund in 1962, who considered the penetration of steel into a sand mold. A pioneering work by J. G. Hentzel and J. Keverian in 1965 was the two-dimensional simulation of the crystallization of steel castings, using a program developed by General Electric to simulate heat transfer. In 1968, Ole Vestby was the first to use the finite difference method to program a 2D model that evaluated the temperature distribution during welding.
The 1980s marked a significant increase in research and development activities around the topic of casting process simulation with contributions from various international groups, including J. T. Berry and R. D. Pielke in the United States, E. Niyama in Japan, W. Kurz in Lausanne, and F. Durand in Grenoble. An especially important role in advancing this field was played by Professor P. R. Sahm at the Aachen Foundry Institute. Key milestones of this period were the introduction of the ""criterion function"" by Hansen and Berry in 1980, the Niyama criterion function for the representation of central porosities in 1982, and the proposal of a criterion function for the detection of hot cracks in steel castings by E. Fehlner and P. N. Hansen in 1984. In the late 1980s, the first capabilities for simulating mold filling were developed.
The 1990s focused on the simulation of stresses and strains in castings with significant contributions from Hattel and Hansen in 1990. This decade also saw efforts to predict microstructures and mechanical properties with the pioneering work of I. Svensson and M. Wessen in Sweden.


== Principles of casting simulation ==

The production of casting is one of the most complex and multifaceted processes in metallurgy, requiring careful control and an understanding of a multitude of physical and chemical phenomena. To effectively manage this process and ensure the high quality of the final products, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the interaction of the various casting parameters. In this context, the mathematical modeling of casting acts as a critically important scientific tool, allowing for detailed analysis and optimization of the casting process based on mathematical principles.
Mathematical modeling of casting is a complex process that involves the formulation and solution of mathematical equations that describe physical phenomena such as thermal conductivity, fluid dynamics, phase transformations, among others. To solve these equations, various numerical analysis methods are applied, among which the finite element method (FEM), finite difference method (FDM), and finite volume method (FVM) hold a special place. Each of these methods has its particular characteristics and is applied depending on the specific modeling tasks and the requirements for precision and efficiency in the calculations.
Finite difference method (FDM): This method is based on differential equations of heat and mass transfer, which are approximated using finite difference relationships. The advantage of the FDM is its simplicity and the ability to simplify the solution of multidimensional problems. However, the method has limitations in modeling the boundaries of complex areas and performs poorly for castings with thin walls.
The finite element method and Finite volume method (FVM): Both methods are based on integral equations of heat and mass transfer. They provide a good approximation of the boundaries and allow the use of elements with different discretizations. The main drawbacks are the need for a finite element generator, the complexity of the equations, and large requirements for memory and time resources.
Modifications of the FVM: These methods attempt to combine the simplicity of the FDM with a good approximation of the boundaries of the FEM. They have the potential to improve the approximation of boundaries between different materials and phases.
The analysis of different methods of mathematical modeling of casting processes shows that the finite element method is one of the most reliable and optimal approaches for casting simulation. Despite higher computational resource requirements and complexity in implementation compared to the finite difference method and finite volume method, the FEM provides high accuracy in modeling boundaries, complex geometries, and temperature fields, which is critically important for predicting defects in castings and optimizing casting processes.


== Application in production ==
Computer-aided engineering (CAE) systems for casting processes have long been used by foundries around the world as a ""virtual foundry workshop,"" where it is possible to perform and verify any idea that arises in the minds of designers and technologists. The global market for CAE for casting processes can already be considered established.
Within the structure of the company for the development of the technology of a new casting, a computer-aided design department for casting processes is created, responsible for operating CAE systems for casting processes. Calculations are carried out by specialists of the department according to their job instructions, and interaction with other departments is regulated by technological design instructions.
The process begins with the delivery of the 3D model and drawing of the part to the foundry technologists, who coordinate the casting configuration with the mechanical workshop and determine the margins. Then, the technology is developed in the CAE department and transferred to the foundry workshop for experimental castings. The results are monitored, and if necessary, the castings are examined in the central laboratory of the factory. If defects are detected, an adjustment of the model parameters and the technological process is made in the CAE department, after which the technology is tested again in the workshop.
This cycle is repeated until suitable castings are obtained, after which the technology is considered developed and implemented in mass production.


== Software and tools ==

In the modern foundry industry, software for the simulation of casting processes is widely used. Among the multitude of software solutions available, it is worth mentioning the most prominent and widely used products: Procast, MAGMASOFT, and PoligonSoft.
ProCAST: a casting process modeling system using the finite element method, which provides the joint solution of temperature, hydrodynamics, and deformation problems, along with unique metallurgical capabilities, for all casting processes and casting alloys. In addition to the main aspects of casting production – filling, crystallization, and porosity prediction, ProCAST is capable of predicting the occurrence of deformations and residual stresses in the casting and can be used to analyze processes such as core making, centrifugal casting, lost wax casting, continuous casting.
PoligonSoft: a casting process modeling system using the finite element method. Applicable for modeling almost any casting technology and any casting alloy. For a long time, PoligonSoft was the only casting process modeling system in the world that included a special model for calculating microporosity. To date, this model can be considered the most stable, and the results obtained with its help can satisfy the most demanding users. In many respects, PoligonSoft can be considered the Russian equivalent of the ProCAST system.
MAGMASOFT: a casting process modeling system using the finite difference method. It allows analyzing thermal processes, mold filling, crystallization, and predicting defects in castings. The program includes modules for different casting technologies and helps optimize casting parameters to improve product quality. MAGMASOFT is an effective tool for increasing the productivity and quality of casting production.


== Future trends ==
The simulation of the casting process reflects the user's knowledge, who decides whether the filling system has led to an acceptable result. Optimization suggestions must come from the operator. The main problem is that all processes occur simultaneously and are interconnected: changes in one parameter affect many quality characteristics of the casting.
Autonomous optimization, which began in the late 1980s, uses the simulation tool as a virtual testing ground, changing filling conditions and process parameters to find the optimal solution. This allows evaluating numerous process parameters and their impact on process stability.
It is important to remember that only what can be modeled can be optimized. Optimization does not replace process knowledge or experience. The simulation user must know the objectives and quality criteria necessary to achieve those objectives and formulate specific questions to the program to obtain quantitative solutions.

Brickfilm,"A brickfilm is a stop-motion movie using Legos, Mega Blocks, or  other Lego-like products. Brickfilms are often used to help the Lego Group advertise more sets and themes. The first known Brickfilm was called ""The Magic Portal"". It was made from
1980–1989 in Perth, Western Australia by Lindsay Fleay.
A brickfilm can be made by taking a Lego character and placing it on a board. The creator takes a picture, slightly moves the character, and repeats this step many times. The pictures are then streamed together using video editing software. Fifteen frames per second (15 fps) is a common frame-rate.

Medicine,"Medicine is the science that treats and prevents diseases in humans. Medical workers treat injuries, infections, and sickness. Medicine also helps people with disease prevention and the best ways to not get sick from bacteria or viruses. Medical doctors also help unhealthy (bad habits, overweight, underweight) people return to a healthy condition.
People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care workers.
Many doctors specialize in one kind of medical work. For example, pediatrics is the medical specialty about the health of children.


== Specialties in Medicine ==


=== Anaesthesiology ===
An anesthetist (British spelling: anaesthetist) is a doctor trained to provide sedation during surgeries. This is important for surgeries and certain medical procedures. 
Anesthetists also provide pre-operative assessments, ensuring the patient is safe during any operation, and successfully wakes them from anaesthesia when the procedure is complete. 
Anesthetists assess medical conditions and suitability for anaesthesia. They screen for risk factors prior to surgery and try to optimize the operative environment for the patient and the surgeon. This means that if the patient has allergies (for example a latex allergy), none will be present in the operating room. They also monitor for and respond to emergencies during surgery. They are the doctors who prevent or treat pain in different situations. These situations include: giving injections into the blood vessels or fat, epidurals (pain medications injected into the spine) during labor and delivery in pregnancy; provide spinal blocks; local nerve blocks; and general anaesthesia for procedures. 
They are the doctors who are especially trained in intubation and ventilation, which is helping the patient breath when they are paralyzed and asleep during surgery.  Hence, due to their skill in intubation, they can be first line responders for emergencies. They help people who are having trouble breathing or when their airway has become obstructed (like apnea). The anesthetist is the person responsible for giving injections in such emergencies also. 
Anaesthesiology is the practise of studying anesthesia.


=== Cardiology ===
A cardiologist is a doctor with special training about the heart. The doctor in this field ensures the heart is healthy and functions properly. 
The heart is a vital organ whose role is to pump blood around the body via the arteries, and back to the heart by veins. The purpose of blood is to deliver oxygen to the tissues and take out carbon dioxide. Without the heart functioning well, tissues and organs would die and not function properly. 
Cardiologists treat heart attacks, sudden cardiac arrests, arrhythmias (rhythm issues related to a faulty electrical system of the heart), heart failure (where the heart fails to pump blood forward properly) and many other heart related illnesses. They specialize in life saving procedures like cardiac stents and cardiac ablation. There is a subspecialty within cardiology called ""Interventional cardiology."" These are cardiologists who specialize in interventions or procedures to save the function of the heart, such as cardiac stenting or angiography.
Cardiology is the study of the heart.


=== Cardiovascular surgery ===

This specialty consists of well trained doctors who practice cardiac surgery. They are best known for their role in cardiac bypass surgeries. In cardiac bypass, the surgeon restores blood flow to the area of the heart that was deficient due to a blocked coronary artery. This is usually done by taking a vein, most commonly the saphenous vein from the leg, to create a pathway of blood flow to the heart region that needs it.


=== Dermatology ===
A dermatologist is a doctor that studies different conditions of the skin and also allergies. This can include allergy-related conditions, acne, inflammatory conditions of the skin, and skin cancer. They prescribe medications to put on the skin, such as lotions and creams, or pills to treat these different conditions. In a clinical setting they might also test the skin for single or multiple different contact allergies for allergies such as pollen, animals, or latex.


=== Emergency Medicine ===

Emergency room doctors (also known as E.R. Doctors) are in charge of sudden important or life-threatening emergencies. In addition to dealing with heart attacks, strokes, traumas, or other issues that require immediate medical attention or surgeries, they also deal with a wide range of other health conditions, such as mental health suicide attempts and drug overdoses. 
Their training is broad and diverse, as anyone can walk through the door seeking help. They see patients of all ages and walks of life. However, unlike a general practitioner or family doctor, their immediate goal is to make sure the patient is stable and exclude any serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.


=== Family medicine ===
A family doctor, otherwise known as general practitioner, is trained to provide medical service to people of all ages, demographics, and walks of life. Their training is diverse to deal with a variety of conditions including all non surgical specialties. They also follow the patient from birth to death and are trained to treat an individual as a whole, in the context of their social setting, their family situation and mental health and so on. Unlike specialists who mainly deal with problems of one organ or system, family doctors deal with all parts of the body and combine this new information for the patient's general health. They gain a perspective of the person's health as a whole. They can refer to specialists for issues that require more detailed or specialized treatments as part of their treatment options.


=== Gastroenterology ===
Gastroenterologists are doctors who specialize in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and upper abdominal organs. The GI tract is consists of the esophagus all the way down to the anus. The upper abdominal organs include the liver, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen. In addition to dealing with medical conditions associated with these organs, doctors in this speciality also perform endoscopies. This is where a camera is placed to visualize the esophagus and stomach (upper endoscopy) or the colon (lower endoscopy or colonoscopy). 
Gastroenterologists that specialize in the liver is called a Hepatologist. They are responsible for treating patients with liver failure or cirrhosis. They also treat patients with viral Hepatitis (A,B,C) and many other forms of liver disease.


=== Infectious Disease ===
Infectious disease specialist M.Ds are doctors that study and treat difficult or rare infections, such as rare tropical diseases, antibiotic resistant bacterial infections, dangerous viruses and other highly contagious diseases.


=== Internal Medicine ===

Doctors in this specialty are trained to recognize and treat a variety of different conditions involving the internal organs. They have wide knowledge in a number of specialties including, but not limited to: Respirology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Cardiology. 
Doctors who practice broadly in this field are known as General Internists (or General Internal Medicine doctors). Internists can go to receive further training beyond residency in a particular field. For example, Gastroenterologists are internists that have chosen to specialize in GI medicine. 
Internal medicine doctors are in charge of inpatient units when patients are admitted for a general reason. Unlike family doctors and emergency doctors, although their training is diverse and they have broad knowledge in many organ systems, they do not treat or manage children, babies, or pregnant women. (Those patients are instead cared for by Pediatricians and Obstetrics/gynecology, respectively.)


=== Gynecology and obstetrics ===
Doctors in this field, certified as an OB/GYN or Obs/Gyn, specialize in women's health covering conditions of the female reproductive organs, and pregnancy care and delivery. 
Some matters they cover include contraceptive medicine, fertility workup and treatments, prolapse and incontinence, sexual health, ovarian tumors/ cysts, gynecological oncology. They are also surgeons in their fields, capable of performing numerous gynecological surgeries. 
OB/GYNs also practice obstetrical medicine, specializing in maternal fetal care and deliveries, complications related to deliveries, assisted deliveries (such as vacuum and forceps deliveries) and Caesarian sections.


=== Medical Genetics ===
A medical geneticist is a type of doctor who might see adults, children, or newborns, to determine if a medical condition is caused by a genetic condition (a change in DNA or genes). 
Medical genetics has different subspecialties for the different types of conditions that are treated. These subspecialties include cancer genetics (counseling for cancer conditions passed down through families), reproductive genetics (counseling for parents who have trouble getting pregnant, or who are tested before planning a pregnancy and found to have genes that may cause a genetic condition in a child such as cystic fibrosis, the commonest genetic condition), or metabolic genetics (counseling and medical treatment for children and adults born with problems in using fats, proteins, or carbohydrates from food to make energy).


=== Nephrology ===
Nephrologists are MDs who specialize in health and diseases of the kidneys.
Nephrology is the study of the kidneys.


=== Neurology ===
Neurologists are MDs who study and treat the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and brain (Central nervous system or CNS), and its branches (peripheral nervous system). Treatment may include medications or surgery.


=== Oncology ===
Oncology is the field of medicine that studies and treats cancer. 
A person that studies cancer is called an Oncologist. 


=== Ophthalmology ===
This medical specialty consists of doctors who recognize and treat medical conditions associated with the eyes. Treatment may include medications or surgery.
Some common complaints they see include red eyes (conjunctivitis), eye pain, visual changes and trauma (damage by an object or person). Ophthalmologists deal with many eye diseases including conjunctivitis, iritis, blepharitis, hordeolum, chalazion, glaucoma, cataracts, and so on. Everyone needs medical help with their eyes eventually, and by old age (65 or older) they will have worn down enough to get cataracts.


=== Orthopedics ===
Orthopedists doctors specialising in the treatment of bones. They treat broken or fractured bones, musculo-skeletal problems and others such as osteoporosis.


=== Otolaryngology ===
These are doctors with special training to treat the ears, nose and throat.  These are the doctors who will very commonly remove an organ called the tonsils from a patient.


=== Pathology ===
Pathologists study the reasons things go wrong with the body. They examine tissue samples, look for cancer cell types under a microscope, evaluate DNA samples and many other specimens with advanced laboratory techniques.


=== Psychiatry ===
Psychiatrists are MDs who study and treat behavioral and thinking disorders.


=== Pulmonary ===

This medical area, commonly known as chest medicine or respiratory medicine, deals with the respiratory system. It commonly involves patients who require intensive care including life support and mechanical ventilation. 
Doctors of this field usually are knowledgeable in diseases and conditions of the chest, such as pneumonia or asthma. Doctors in this field tend to perform minor procedures in surgery of the respiratory tract. Pulmonary specialists often practice critical care medicine. They also manage complicated chest infections.


=== Radiology ===
Radiologists are physicians who read and explain medical images such as x-ray pictures, CT scans, MRIs, Ultrasound images and other diagnostic movies and pictures. They also direct radiation treatments for cancer patients and others.


=== Rheumatology ===
Rheumatologists are doctors that treat autoimmune diseases. These types of diseases occur because the body sees parts of the body and cells as ""foreign"" (not part of the body); the immune system (the part of the body the fights infections) attacks the body and causes problems like pain and difficulty with movement. Rheumatologists also treat certain types of chronic pain conditions.


=== Urology ===
Urologists are doctors who study and treat the urogenital system (and urinary tract. Includes the bladder down to the urethra or utherer).

Heat wave,"A heat wave is a period of unusually warm or very hot weather, and may be accompanied by high humidity. ""Heat wave"" is not an exact term: Any weather that feels warmer than people expect, might be called a heat wave. For example, temperatures normal for a warmer climate might be called a ""heat wave"" by people living in a place that is usually cooler.  So a ""heat wave"" could mean a little warm weather, (like ""several days as hot as summer, but in winter""), or temperatures so high they make history, (such as, ""the hottest summer in a hundred years"").

Oriented strand board,"Oriented strand board, commonly called OSB, is a type of particle board which is made of carefully positioned strands of wood. Aspen and other similar woods are cut into long strands parallel to the grain of the wood. It is manufactured into sheets made up of wood strands, wax, and resin adhesives. Sheets are formed under pressure and heat. The finished sheet size varies by country. OSB is very strong making it ideal for building construction. Its most common uses in construction are for covering walls, floors and roofs before the finish products are applied. 

OSB-2 is specially designed OSB for load-bearing purposes. It is for use in dry areas.
OSB-3 is designed the same, but is for use in wet areas.
OSB can also be made from trees from areas burned over by forest fires.

Waterspout,"A waterspout is a funnel cloud over water. It is a nonsupercell tornado over water. Waterspouts do not suck up water; the water seen in the main funnel cloud is actually water droplets formed by condensation. It is weaker than most of its land counterparts.


== Types ==


=== Non-tornadic ===
Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm, are known as ""nontornadic"" or ""fair-weather waterspouts"", and are by far the most common type.
Fair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective cumulus towers. 


=== Snowspout ===
A winter waterspout, also known as a snow devil, an icespout, an ice devil, a snonado, or a snowspout, is a very rare meteorological phenomenon in which a vortex from snow develops that looks like a waterspout.  One does not know much about this rare happening and there are only six known pictures of this event so far.
There are three main things that produce a winter waterspout:

Very cold temperatures present over a body of warm water enough to produce fog that looks like steam above the water's surface.  This usually needs temperatures of -18 °C or colder if the water temperature is no warmer than 5 °C.
Lake-effect snows in a small, enclosed or banded formation must be present and going on.
The wind speed has to be slow, usually less than 5 knots (9.25 km/h).

Skeleton (computer programming),"Skeleton programming is a style of computer programming based on simple high-level program structures and so called dummy code. Program skeletons resemble pseudocode, but allow parsing, compilation and testing of the code.  Dummy code is inserted in a program skeleton to simulate processing and avoid compilation error messages. It may involve empty function declarations, or functions that return a correct result only for a simple test case where the expected response of the code is known.
Skeleton programming facilitates a top-down design approach, where a partially functional system with complete high-level structures is designed and coded, and this system is then progressively expanded to fulfill the requirements of the project.  Program skeletons are also sometimes used for high-level descriptions of algorithms.  A program skeleton may also be utilized as a template that reflects syntax and structures commonly used in a wide class of problems.
Skeleton programs are utilized in the template method design pattern used in object-oriented programming. In object-oriented programming, dummy code corresponds to an abstract method, a method stub or a mock object. In the Java remote method invocation (Java RMI) nomenclature, a stub communicates on the client-side with a skeleton on the server-side.
A class skeleton is an outline of a class that is used in software engineering. It contains a description of the class's roles, and describes the purposes of the variables and methods, but does not implement them. The class is later implemented from the skeleton. The skeleton can also be known as either an interface or an abstract class, with languages that follow a polymorphic paradigm.


== Background ==
Modern software is often complicated due to a host of reasons. This can mean that not just a single programmer can develop it, or that other modules or parts have to be separately imported. The programs can also be too complex on their own, some with multiple methods accessing a single variable at the same time or even generating pixels for displays. Skeleton code is used to assist programmers to develop their code with the fewest errors during the time of compilation.
Skeleton code is most commonly found in parallel programming, but is also applied in other situations, like documentation in programming languages. This helps to simplify the core functionality of a potentially confusing method. It can also be used to allow for a small function within a larger program to operate without full functionality temporarily.
This method of programming is easier than writing a complete function, as these skeleton functions do not have to include main functionalities and can instead be hardcoded to use during development. They usually involve syntactically correct code to introduce the method, as well as comments to indicate the operation of the program. This is not always necessary to call a piece of text skeleton code.


== Relation to pseudocode ==

Pseudocode is most commonly found when developing the structure of a new piece of software. It is a plain English portrayal of a particular function within a larger system, or can even be a representation of a whole program. Pseudocode is similar to skeleton programming, however deviates in the fact that pseudocode is primarily an informal method of programming. Dummy code is also very similar to this, where code is used simply as a placeholder, or to signify the intended existence of a method in a class or interface.
Computer programmers are extremely dependent on pseudocode, so much so that it has a measurable impact on their psyche. A typical programmer is so conditioned with the idea of writing simplified code in some manner, be it by writing pseudocode or skeleton code, or even just by drawing a diagram, that this has a measurable impact on how well they can write their final implementation. This has been found over a number of applications, with different programmers working in different languages and varied programming paradigms.
This method of program design is also most often done on pen and paper, further moving the text from what is actually to be implemented. Skeleton programming mimics this, but differs in the way that it is commonly written in an integrated development environment, or text editors. This assists the further development of the program after the initial design stage. Skeleton programs also allow for simplistic functions to operate, if run.


== Implementation ==
Skeleton programming can be implemented in a range of different programming applications.


=== Programming language documentation ===
Most, if not all programming languages have skeleton code used to assist in the definition of all built-in functions and methods. This provides a simple means for newer programmers to understand the syntax and intended implementation of the written methods.
Java, an object oriented language, focuses heavily on a structured documentation page with completely separated methods for each object part of Java's packages. Object oriented languages focus on a hierarchy based structure to their implementations, rather than a simple top-down approach found in other languages. ‘Objects’ store data and variables in them, allowing for a typically more efficient program to be written. These objects have individual functions that can access internal variables, known as methods.
Each method is defined in the same format, with the name of the method as well as the syntax to be used in an integrated development environment clearly visible at the top of a block. With Java's focus on scope, data types and inheritance, this syntax is extremely useful for new, if not all programmers. This is followed by an in-depth explanation of the operation of the method, with errors below.
Python has a similar approach to document its in-built methods, however mimics the language's lack of fixation on scope and data types. This documentation has the syntax of each method, along with a short description and an example of the typical use of the method or function. The skeleton code provided in the example gives programmers a good understanding of the function at a quick glance.


=== Class definition ===
Classes written by third-party developers, primarily as a part of libraries, also showcase their programming in the form of skeleton code. This helps to inform any that are new to the library as to how the functions and methods operate. P5.Js uses this format on their documentation page to explain the intended use of certain included functions. This is different to the programming language documentation however, using skeleton code to display parameters rather than all possible uses of the method.
Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) are most typically found in situations where programmers attempt to take an input, usually colloquially termed (without the use of programming language specific jargon) and use this to create a program or a method. An implementation of this uses a small set of skeleton code to imply the function running in the background.
Other forms of NLIs use different forms of input, ranging from other users speaking different languages, to gesture based input to produce a very similar result. With programming languages being developed and written primarily in English, people speaking other languages find it hard to develop new software. NLIs have been used in some studies  to assist people in these situations. The study showed classes written in Java through the use of NLIs. This removed the need for learning syntactical rules, however meant that the class was written using a basic set of skeleton code.


=== Polymorphism-based definitions ===
Polymorphism is an ideology that follows with the object oriented programming paradigm, where methods can be overridden or overloaded (methods with the same name in a child class which will take priority over a method written in a parent class). The definition of methods is based on a skeleton framework defined by the syntax of the language.
Very similar to class implementation, skeleton code can be used to define the methods that are part of an interface. An interface is essentially a blueprint of a class, which allows for strict object oriented languages (such as Java) to use classes from different packages without the need to fully understand the internal functions. Interfaces simply define the methods that have to be present within the class, allowing anyone else to use the methods or implement the class for their personal needs. 

public skeletonExample();

An abstract class is almost the same as a class implementation, however depending on the language, at least one method is defined as abstract. This implies that any children of this class (any classes that extend or implement) need to have a method defined for this. Abstract classes have a very similar definition style to interfaces, however a keyword ‘abstract’ is typically used to identify the fact that it needs to be implemented in child classes.

public abstract skeletonExample();

These examples use the Java syntax.


== Parallel programming ==
Parallel programming is the operation of multiple functions simultaneously most commonly used to increase efficiency. These are typically the hardest types of programs to develop, due to their complexity and interconnectedness with the hardware in question as well. Many developers have attempted to write programs with this core functionality, however this has been met by varied results.
Algorithmic skeleton frameworks are used in parallel programming to abstractly describe the methods in question for later development. The frameworks are not limited to a single type, and each of these types have different purposes to increase the efficiency of the developer's program. These can be categorised into three main types: data-parallel, task-parallel and resolution.


=== Data-parallel ===
These skeleton algorithms are used to develop programs that work on large data based software, usually identifying the connections between data for later use. Data parallel algorithms include ‘maps’, ‘forks’ and ‘reduces’ or ‘scans’.

‘Maps’ are the most commonly used data parallel algorithms, and typically involve a single operation completed on a large set of data. To increase efficiency, a number of data sets have this operation applied to them simultaneously, before the data is structured together again at the end.
‘Forks’ are similar to ‘maps’ but they use a different operation for certain data types. This is known as multiple data parallelism.
‘Reduces’ or ‘scans’ are used to apply prefixes to a set of data, before then applying an operation upon the data. These are different to ‘maps’ as they have a set of partial results during the runtime of the method itself.


=== Task-parallel ===
These operations, as their name suggests, work on tasks. Each type of algorithm under this is different due to a change in the behaviour between tasks. Task parallel algorithms include ‘sequentials’, ‘farms’, ‘pipes’, ‘if’, ‘for’ and ‘while’.

‘Sequential’ closes and terminates a nested set of skeleton algorithms. The methods and programs that are part of the skeletons are included as terminating aspects of the program, before closing.
‘Farms’ are known as a group of tasks, a worker, or as a master or slave of another function. It completes the given tasks by replicating the tasks over multiple threads and running these concurrently. This divides the load for a specific thread, effectively creating a master / slave relationship between the threads.
‘Pipes’ are the more traditional forms of algorithms, where each method or function is run in a sequence. This follows the order in which the programmer has written their code. This is made parallel by computing varied tasks on a set of data, typically input, simultaneously to improve performance and speed. Each simultaneous computation is known as a stage. The pipe algorithm can be nested, where one is within another, each splitting up responsibilities to increase speed and also the number of stages.
‘If’ gives the program a conditional split of tasks, where a set of skeleton code is split into two main sections. A conditional statement is given to the program, therefore giving it a specified algorithm to follow.
‘For’ operates a task a number of times, both specified by the programmer, allowing for a more efficient set of code. The number of times that the code runs is a preset value, indicating that at runtime, this cannot be changed. It must complete the task the number of times given.
‘While’ is an algorithm very similar to the operation of a ‘for’ algorithm, where a task is completed a number of times. However, in ‘while’ algorithms, the program computes the task a number of times before a conditional statement is met. This means that the ‘while’ algorithm can perform its task a different number of times for each time it is run.


=== Resolution skeletons ===
These skeletons are very different to the typical skeletons found above. ‘Resolution’ algorithms use a combination of methods to solve a specified problem. The algorithm's given problem can be a “family of problems”. There are two main types of these skeletons, ‘divide and conquer’ or ‘brand and bound’.

‘Divide and conquer’ uses a map skeleton as its basis, combining this with a while skeleton to solve the problem. In map algorithms, functions on data are applied simultaneously. In ‘divide and conquer’ the set of data provided has a function applied to it using the map skeleton, however this can be applied recursively using the ‘while’ algorithm. The ‘while’ is only broken when the entire problem is solved.
‘Branch and bound’ is an algorithm that also uses map algorithms, however instead of applying the ‘while’ algorithm to run the tasks simultaneously, this algorithm splits the tasks into branches. Each branch has a specific purpose, or ‘bound’, where the conditional statement will cause it to stop.

Bride burning,"Bride burning is a form of domestic violence practiced in countries located on or around the Indian subcontinent. A form of dowry death, bride-burning occurs when a woman is murdered by her husband or his family for her family's refusal to pay additional dowry. The wife is typically doused with kerosene, gasoline, or other flammable liquid, and set alight, leading to death by burning. Kerosene is often used as the cooking fuel for small petrol stoves, some of which are dangerous, so it allows the claim that the crime was an accident. It is most common in India and has been a major problem there since at least 1993.
Bride burning has been recognized as an important problem in India, accounting for around 2,500 deaths per year in the country. In 1995, Time magazine reported that dowry deaths in India increased from around 400 a year in the early 1980s to around 5,800 a year by the middle of the 1990s. A year later, CNN ran a story saying that police receive more than 2,500 reports of bride burning every year. According to Indian National Crime Record Bureau, there were 1,948 convictions and 3,876 acquittals in dowry death cases in 2008.


== History ==


=== Dowry deaths ===

A dowry death is the death of a young woman in South Asian countries, primarily India, who is murdered or driven to suicide by her husband. This results from the husband or his family continually attempting to extract more dowry from the bride or her family. Bride burning is just one form of dowry death; acid throwing, poisoning and other forms of fatal violence also occur. Because dowry typically depends on class or socioeconomic status, women are often subjected to the dowry pressures of their future husband or his relatives.


=== Origins of bride burning ===
There are at least four perspectives on why bride burning came to be and how its existence has prevailed in South Asian nations, as detailed by Avnita Lakhani in her report on bride burning titled ""The Elephant in the Room Is Out of Control"". These theories describe practices that contributed to the rise of dowry as a whole, thus ultimately contributing to bride burning.
One of the more culturally-founded theories suggests that in a highly patriarchal society such as India, a woman's role is defined from before she is born, which ultimately places her as lesser than men. Because she is seen as a burden and an ""extra mouth to feed"", her status as an economic liability promotes the idea that men, who are considered physical assets, can treat women as subservient. Once a woman marries, she is bound to her husband and his will because ""society mandates obedience to her husband"".
Another theory claims that consumerism has caused countries like India to become greedy. Because of this, dowry is used as a means to gain a higher socioeconomic status. As status is continually gained, the demand for bridal dowry increases in order to keep moving up the social ladder.
Lakhani also suggests that historically speaking, the dowry system may have been conceived as a way to distinguish Muslim from Hindu culture, creating a further divide within castes. A higher dowry would indicate a higher status and distinction from Islam, thus providing an incentive to demand a larger dowry.
Finally, some scholars argue that the dowry practice came out of British rule and influence in India to distinguish ""different forms of marriage"" between castes. When the dowry system was established within the higher castes, the British government sought to reinforce it in the lower castes as a means to eradicate their more ritualised marriages. Such forms of union were discredited until only upper-caste marriage systems were recognised.


== In South Asia ==
According to an estimate from 2011, between 4,000 and 25,000 deaths occur from bride burning every year in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.


=== In India ===

Ashley K. Jutla and David Heimbach describe bride burning by saying that ""the husband and/or in-laws have determined that the dowry, a gift given from the daughter's parents to the husband, was inadequate and therefore attempt to murder the new bride to make the husband available to remarry or to punish the bride and her family."" In India, dowry size is a reflection of wealth. The Indian author Rajesh Talwar has written a play on dowry deaths titled The Bride Who Would Not Burn.
In 1961, the government of India passed the Dowry Prohibition Act, making the dowry demands in wedding arrangements illegal.
In 1986, the Indian Parliament added dowry deaths as a new domestic violence crime. According to the new section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, where a bride ""within 7 years of her marriage is killed and it is shown that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband, or any relative of her husband, or in connection with any demand for dowry, such death shall be called 'dowry death' and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.""
The offenders can be sentenced for any period, from a minimum of seven years in prison to a maximum of life. Many cases of dowry-related domestic violence, suicides, and murders have been reported. A 1997 report claimed that at least 5000 women die each year because of dowry deaths and at least a dozen die each day in 'kitchen fires' thought to be intentional. About 30 percent of reported dowry deaths result in convictions in courts.


=== In Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, the Progressive Women's Association says that 300 women are burned to death each year by their husband's families and that bride burning incidents are sometimes disguised as accidents, such as an 'exploding stove'. According to the Association, doctors say that victims presenting from these accidents have injuries inconsistent with stove burns. According to an Amnesty International report in 1999, although 1600 bride burning incidents were reported, only 60 were prosecuted and, of those, only two resulted in convictions.
In Pakistan, women including Shahnaz Bukhari have been campaigning for protective legislation against the practice, for established women's shelters and for hospitals with specialised burn wards. Amnesty International has said that pressure from within, as well as from international human rights groups, may be increasing the level of awareness within the Pakistani government. The BBC estimated that roughly 300 Pakistani brides were burnt to death in 1999.

In 1988, a survey showed that 800 women were killed in this manner; in 1989, the number rose to 1100, and in 1990 it stood at 1800 estimated killings. Newspapers in Lahore in a six-month period (1997) reported on average 15 attacks a month. According to an estimate by Human Development in South Asia, on average there are 16 cases of bride burnings a month. Women's eNews reported 4000 women attacked in this manner in Islamabad's surroundings over an eight-year period and that the average age range of victims is between 18 and 35 with an estimated 30 percent being pregnant at the time of death. Shahnaz Bukhari has said of such attacks: Either Pakistan is home to possessed stoves which burn only young housewives, and are particularly fond of genitalia, or looking at the frequency with which these incidences occur there is a grim pattern that these women are victims of deliberate murder. According to the Progressive Women's Association such attacks are a growing problem and in 1994 on International Women's Day announced that various NGOs would join to raise awareness of the issue. One woman is killed every hour in Pakistan as a form of domestic violence, a practice known as bride burning, a category of dowry murder, resulting in possibly one of the most gruesome deaths, burning alive.


== In other nations ==
Occasionally, bride burning happens among resettled Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in other parts of the world, such as the United States.


=== In the United States ===
Aleyamma Mathew was a registered nurse at a hospital in Carrollton, Texas, who died of burn wounds on 5 April 1992. She and her husband, Mathew Varughese, had immigrated from India two decades before and had three daughters in the United States. The couple had been having marital problems since the late 1980s, which culminated in a fight that led to Aleyamma's death. She was found by her children, doused in gasoline and covered in flames, dying soon after.
Brief articles were run in The Dallas Morning News and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution after the incident, while the Dallas Observer ran a detailed, nine-page article covering Aleyamma's death. The article faced some criticism for its portrayal of non-Western countries as backward or inappropriate: ""Battered by her husband, Aleyamma Mathew remained true to her culture. In the end she became its victim.""


== Controlling bride burning ==
There are current governmental initiatives to criminalize bride burning and grassroots organizations working to combat the practice, as well as international laws working against human rights violations. Finally, there are many proposed initiatives in place to end bride burning globally.


=== Governmental efforts ===
In 1961, India enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act, to halt dowry murders. It was amended in the early 1980s to ""rectify several inherent weaknesses and loopholes"" in order to make it a criminal offense if the husband or his relatives causes a woman to ""die of burns or bodily injury or unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage and where there is evidence that she suffered cruelty and harassment in connection with the dowry."" This law, however, does not provide a comprehensive definition of dowry, which can change the way it is demanded and delivered. Ultimately, this allowed perpetrators more flexibility in the court of dowry death. The seven-year clause is equally problematic, as it simply allowed husbands to wait until that period ended to burn or otherwise cause the death of their bride.
Another major Indian law, the 1983 ""Anti-Cruelty Statute"", prohibits cruelty towards a wife and subjects the husband and/or in-laws to fines or imprisonment if they inflict cruelty upon the wife. However, the law is equally ambiguous, which results in inadequate enforcement of bride burning and dowry murders.
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares the following: ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood"". Article 5 proclaims: ""No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""


=== Non-governmental efforts ===

In India, where most cases of bride burning are seen, domestic legislation is typically inadequately enforced. Because of this, grassroots organizations ""have taken up the cause to halt bride burning"". One example of this is government-funded family counseling center cells, in which the intended goal is to strengthen family ties and reduce legal intervention. However, often such cells only reinforce the stereotype of ""women's sharp tongues"" and men's power to ""hit and beat"". Other similar counseling-style NGOs have been developed in order to resolve such issues with similar consequences.


=== Potential efforts ===
Primarily, alternative initiatives resolve around reform of current flawed, failing laws. One proposal calls for the expansion of the protection for women under the international refugee law in order to provide asylum to victims of gender discrimination or gendercide. One way this could be achieved would be by including women in the definition of a ""persecuted social group"", which would allow their gender to seek international asylum under fear of dowry-related persecution globally.
In April 1984, European Parliament introduced a proposal that would ""protect women from persecution on the basis of gender"" by reforming international refugee laws. However, the proposal was rejected.
Another solution is to increase economic interest for women by establishing their property rights. Even when married, the bride has no rights over the property belonging to the husband while he is living. In giving women the right to own property, women would not need to marry for economic or legal purposes, thus disregarding the dowry practice.

Love of money,"In Christian tradition, the love of money is condemned as a sin primarily based on texts such as Ecclesiastes 5:10 and 1 Timothy 6:10. The Christian condemnation relates to avarice and greed rather than money itself. The Christian texts (scriptures) are full of parables and use easy-to-understand subjects, such as money, to convey the actual message, there are further parallels in Solon and Aristotle, and Massinissa—who ascribed love of money to Hannibal and the Carthaginians. Avarice is one of the seven deadly sins in the Christian classifications of vices (sins).  This is a phrase that was borrowed from Diogenes.


== Judaism ==
Berachya Hanakdan lists ""love of money"" as a secular love, while Israel Salanter considers love of money for its own sake a non-universal inner force. A tale about Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apt (1748–1825), rabbi in Iasi, recounts that he, who normally scorned money, had the habit of looking kindly on money before giving it to the poor at Purim, since only in valuing the gift could the gift express love of God. Berachot 54a teaches businessmen to ""elevate their love of money to the same status as their love of God, which means that they should thereby love God enough to follow his commandment.""


== Christianity ==


=== Source text ===
The original Koine Greek reads, ῥίζα γὰρ πάντων τῶν κακῶν ἐστιν ἡ φιλαργυρία (Rhiza gar pantōn tōn kakōn estin hē philargyria) — ""for the root of all evils is the love of money.""
The Greek word φιλαργυρία (philarghyría), from φιλία (philía- friendship) and άργυρος (árghyros- silver, money), can be translated as 'love of money'.
A popular current text, the King James Version shows 1 Timothy 6:10 to be:
For the love of money is the root of all of evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
(The full verse is shown but Bold added being the subject of this page.)
Another popular text, the New International Version has ""For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil....""
During the Reformation, Martin Luther (1483–1546) translated the Latin Vulgate Bible into German, and 1 Timothy 6:10 ""Die Habsucht ist die Wurzel allen Übels.;...""
Soon after Martin Luther's translation of the Bible to German, William Tyndale (1494–1536) did a similar translation into English as ""For covetousness is the root of all evil;...""
The grammarian Daniel B. Wallace lists six alternative possible translations of the primary Greek text, 1 Timothy 6:10. There are two reasons for this: first, it is difficult to tell whether the noun ""root"" is intended to be indefinite, definite, or qualitative. Second, the Greek word for ""all"" may mean ""all without exclusion"" or ""all without distinction"". But by reading more verses either side of 1 Timothy 6:10 a greater surety and confidence that the message is the coveting and striving of greed for something on earth is the sin the Jews and Christians define, where money could be exchanged with anything else on the earth e.g. power. The opposite of greed is charity, each of the Seven deadly sins has a counterpart in the Seven virtues.


=== Cultural history ===
Augustine defines love of money as a subcategory of avarice. Luther referred to the love of money in strong accusations against the Catholic Church in his initial work of the Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences. He saw the selling of an indulgence by the church, i.e. paying money to the church to gain a reduction of penalty of sins in purgatory (a belief unique to the Catholic church) as being more commercial greed of the church than it was doing actual good for the Christian person. Later in some sermons he shone the spotlight on commercial money lenders which happened to be Jewish and one can argue have anti-semitic undertones. However, more to the point is thesis 43 of the Ninety Five thesis ""A Christian who gives to the poor or lends to those in need is doing better in God’s eyes than one who buys ‘forgiveness’ (buys an indulgence)""., as in a Jew who changed from being a money lender with greed to a money lender with charity would be doing better in God's eyes than simply purchasing a piece of paper that said they will spend less time in purgatory from Luther's point of view.

Stroboscopic disc,"The stroboscopic disc was the first tool that showed a moving picture. It is also known as phénakisticope or phenakistoscope.  Simon von Stampfer, and Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau each invented it separately at the start of the 1830s. In 1833, first models were used to amuse people in London. The disc uses the optical illusion called beta movement or stroboscopic movement today. There is a rotating disc with images, and there are small slits between the images. A person watching will look at the reflection of the image in a mirror, from behind the disc. They will look through the slits, and see the images move, as shown in the picture. Franz von Uchatius combined the stroboscopic disc and the laterna magica to get a device that was able to project images, in the 1850s.",0
Oxyhydrogen,"Oxyhydrogen is a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases. This gaseous mixture is used for torches to process refractory materials and was the first
gaseous mixture used for welding. Theoretically, a ratio of 2:1 hydrogen:oxygen is enough to achieve maximum efficiency; in practice a ratio 4:1 or 5:1 is needed to avoid an oxidizing flame.
This mixture may also be referred to as Knallgas (Scandinavian and German Knallgas; lit. 'bang-gas'), although some authors define knallgas to be a generic term for the mixture of fuel with the precise amount of oxygen required for complete combustion, thus 2:1 oxyhydrogen would be called ""hydrogen-knallgas"".
""Brown's gas"" and HHO are terms for oxyhydrogen originating in pseudoscience, although x H2 + y O2 is preferred due to HHO meaning H2O.


== Properties ==
Oxyhydrogen will combust when brought to its autoignition temperature.  For the stoichiometric mixture in air, at normal atmospheric pressure, autoignition occurs at about 570 °C (1065 °F).  The minimum energy required to ignite such a mixture, at lower temperatures, with a spark is about 20 microjoules.  At standard temperature and pressure, oxyhydrogen can burn when it is between about 4% and 95% hydrogen by volume.
When ignited, the gas mixture converts to water vapor and  releases energy, which sustains the reaction: 241.8 kJ of energy (LHV) for every mole of H2 burned.  The amount of heat energy released is independent of the mode of combustion, but the temperature of the flame varies.  The maximum temperature of about 2,800 °C (5,100 °F) is achieved with an exact stoichiometric mixture, about 700 °C (1,300 °F) hotter than a hydrogen flame in air.
When either of the gases are mixed in excess of this ratio, or when mixed with an inert gas like nitrogen, the heat must spread throughout a greater quantity of matter and the flame temperature will be lower.
Oxyhydrogen is explosive and can detonate when ignited, releasing a large amount of energy. This is often demonstrated in classroom environments in which teachers fill a balloon with the gas, due to the easy access of hydrogen and oxygen.


== Production by electrolysis ==
A pure stoichiometric mixture may be obtained by water electrolysis, which uses an electric current to dissociate the water molecules:

Electrolysis: 2 H2O  →  2 H2 + O2
Combustion: 2 H2 + O2  →  2 H2O
William Nicholson was the first to decompose water in this manner in 1800. In theory, the input energy of a closed system always equals the output energy, as the first law of thermodynamics states. However, in practice no systems are perfectly closed, and the energy required to generate the oxyhydrogen always exceeds the energy released by combusting it, even at maximum practical efficiency, as the second law of thermodynamics implies (see Electrolysis of water#Efficiency).


== Applications ==


=== Lighting ===
Many forms of oxyhydrogen lamps have been described, such as the limelight, which used an oxyhydrogen flame to heat a piece of quicklime to white hot incandescence.  Because of the explosiveness of the oxyhydrogen, limelights have been replaced by electric lighting.


=== Oxyhydrogen blowpipe ===
 The foundations of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe were laid down by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley around the last quarter of the eighteenth century. The oxy-hydrogen blowpipe itself was developed by the Frenchman Bochard-de-Saron, the English mineralogist Edward Daniel Clarke and the American chemist Robert Hare in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It produced a flame hot enough to melt such refractory materials as platinum, porcelain, fire brick, and corundum, and was a valuable tool in several fields of science. It is used in the Verneuil process to produce synthetic corundum.


=== Oxyhydrogen torch ===

An oxyhydrogen torch (also known as hydrogen torch) is an oxy-gas torch that burns hydrogen (the fuel) with oxygen (the oxidizer). It is used for cutting and welding metals, glasses, and thermoplastics.
Due to competition from arc welding and other oxy-fuel torches such as the acetylene-fueled cutting torch, the oxyhydrogen torch is seldom used today, but it remains the preferred cutting tool in some niche applications.
Oxyhydrogen was once used in working platinum, because at the time, only it could burn hot enough to melt the metal 1,768.3 °C (3,214.9 °F). These techniques have been superseded by the electric arc furnace.


== Pseudoscientific claims ==
 
Oxyhydrogen is associated with various exaggerated claims. It is often called ""Brown's gas"" or ""HHO gas"", a term popularized by fringe physicist Ruggero Santilli, who claimed that his HHO gas, produced by a special apparatus, is ""a new form of water"", with new properties, based on his fringe theory of ""magnecules"".
Many other pseudoscientific claims have been made about oxyhydrogen, like an ability to neutralize radioactive waste, help plants to germinate, and more.
Oxyhydrogen is often mentioned in conjunction with vehicles that claim to use water as a fuel. The most common and decisive counter-argument against producing this gas on board to use as a fuel or fuel additive is that more energy is always needed to split water molecules than is recouped by burning the resulting gas. Additionally, the volume of gas that can be produced for on-demand consumption through electrolysis is very small in comparison to the volume consumed by an internal combustion engine.
An article in Popular Mechanics in 2008 reported that oxyhydrogen does not increase the fuel economy in automobiles.
""Water-fueled"" cars should not be confused with hydrogen-fueled cars, where the hydrogen is produced elsewhere and used as fuel or where it is used as fuel enhancement.

Consensus Development Program,"The Consensus Development Program is an initiative focused on gathering expert opinions to establish standards and guidelines in various fields, especially in health and medicine. Developed as a collaborative effort by organizations such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the program assembles panels of specialists who assess available evidence on critical topics and form recommendations to guide clinical practice and policy. This method helps ensure that healthcare decisions are informed by the latest scientific research and expert consensus.


== Objectives ==
The primary objective of the Consensus Development Program is to provide authoritative guidance on healthcare practices by evaluating scientific data and expert knowledge. The program covers a broad range of topics, including cancer treatments, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. By facilitating a structured discussion among experts, the program aims to bridge gaps in knowledge, encourage research, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.


== Process ==
The program typically follows a systematic process, beginning with the selection of a topic that requires consensus. This is followed by a thorough review of existing literature and data, with the assistance of resources such as PubMed and the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Expert panels then deliberate in workshops and public sessions, where they discuss findings and draft recommendations. The final step involves disseminating the panel's conclusions to stakeholders, including healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public.


== Impact on Cancer Treatment ==
The Consensus Development Program has had a significant influence on cancer care, offering evidence-based recommendations that shape screening guidelines, treatment protocols, and patient care strategies. The program addresses issues such as the benefits and risks of specific treatments, the development of new diagnostic tools, and the ethical considerations in cancer care. The comprehensive approach ensures that recommendations are based on a balanced view of risks and benefits.

Anime convention,"An anime convention is an event where people who like anime and things that are Japanese come together. Most conventions take all weekend, and many of the people dress up like characters from anime and video games and go to many different kinds of events during the convention.


== Activities ==
People who go to anime conventions do a lot of different things. Many of them dress up in costumes, play video games, sing in karaoke, and watch various anime that yet to be widely released. 
A dealer's room is also often popular, and it usually has many people selling unique items related to anime, Japan, or video games. A similar room, called the artist's alley, is also often available for local and beginning artists to promote themselves and sell their items as well. 
Conventions also have talks about anime, video rooms, and places to meet artists.


== Guests ==
Most conventions bring famous people to the convention who are called guests. The people who are at the convention can talk to these guests, get autographs, and sometimes take pictures.

Theft of fire,"The theft of fire for the benefit of humanity is a theme that recurs in many world mythologies, symbolizing the acquisition of knowledge, or technology, and its transformative impact on civilization. Its recurrent themes include trickster figures as the thief, and supernatural heroic guardians who hoard fire from humanity, often out of mistrust for humans. These myths reflect the profound significance of fire in human history, seen as a pivotal step in the development of human society.
In African mythology, the San peoples tell of ǀKaggen, stealing fire from the ostrich and bringing it to people. In the Americas, Native American and First Nations tribes attribute the gift of fire to animals.
In Eurasian cultures, fire theft takes on various forms. The Vedic Rigveda narrates hero Mātariśvan recovering hidden fire. Greek mythology recounts Prometheus stealing heavenly fire for humanity, a deed for which he suffered greatly. In Oceania, Polynesian myths often feature Māui as the fire thief, with diverse variations across regions.
The metaphor of fire theft extends into modern times, particularly in the context of nuclear weapons. The destructive power of atomic bombs is likened to Prometheus's act, symbolizing the dangerous knowledge humanity has gained. This comparison has been drawn in publications and discussions, emphasizing the ethical and moral implications of nuclear technology. Figures like Robert Oppenheimer, and statesmen Henry Kissinger have invoked the metaphor to highlight the responsibility that comes with such power. The narrative highlights the dual nature of technological advancement, capable of advancing society and posing significant threats.


== Examples ==


=== Africa ===
The San peoples, the indigenous Southern African hunter-gatherers, tell how ǀKaggen, in the form of a mantis, brought the first fire to the people by stealing it from the ostrich, who kept the fire beneath its wings. In another version of the myth, Piisi|koagu steals fire from the ostrich.


=== The Americas ===
Among various Native American tribes of the Pacific Northwest and First Nations, fire was stolen and given to humans by Coyote, Beaver or Dog.
In Algonquin myth, Rabbit stole fire from an old man and his two daughters.
In Cherokee myth, after Possum and Buzzard had failed to steal fire, Grandmother Spider used her web to sneak into the land of light. She stole fire, hiding it in a clay pot or a silk net.
According to a Mazatec legend, the opossum spread fire to humanity. Fire fell from a star and an old woman kept it for herself. The opossum took fire from the old woman and carried the flame on its tail, resulting in its hairlessness.
According to the Muscogees/Creeks, Rabbit stole fire from the Weasels.
In Ojibwa myth, Nanabozho the hare stole fire and gave it to humans.
According to some Yukon First Nations people, Crow stole fire from a volcano in the middle of the water.
In a story from the Lengua/Enxet people of the Gran Chaco in Paraguay, a man steals fire from a bird after he notices the bird cooking snails on burning sticks. The bird enacts revenge by creating a thunderstorm that damages the man's village.


=== Asia ===
In Chinese mythology, Suiren is an ancient mythological figure regarded as one of the pioneers of civilization. He is most famous for inventing the method of making fire, teaching people how to use fire for warmth, cooking food, and driving away wild animals. As a result, Suiren is revered as one of the ""Three Sovereigns"" of the ''Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors'' period in Chinese history.
In Hindu mythology, according to the vedic Rigveda (3:9.5), the hero Mātariśvan recovered fire, which had been hidden from humanity.
While Omoikane in Japanese mythology is not directly associated with the theft of fire, he fits into the broader motif of bringing light and knowledge to humanity, which parallels the Promethean myth. Omoikane is revered for his wisdom and strategic thinking, particularly in the myth where he helps orchestrate the plan to lure the sun goddess Amaterasu out of her cave, restoring light to the world.
In Mesopotamian mythology, Enki, the god of wisdom and water, is known for his role in bestowing knowledge and gifts upon humanity, including the creation of humans and the granting of essential skills and arts.


=== Europe ===
In Greek mythology, according to Hesiod (Theogony, 565-566 and Works & Days, 50) and Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, 1.7.1), the Titan-god Prometheus steals the heavenly fire for humanity, enabling the progress of civilization, for which he was punished by being chained to a mountain and having his liver eaten by an eagle every day until being eventually being freed by the hero Heracles.
In one of the versions of Georgian myth, Amirani stole fire from metalsmiths, who refused to share it – and knowledge of creating it – with other humans.
The story of Faust in German folklore and legends aligns with the Promethean motif of the theft of fire, as it also features a protagonist who seeks forbidden knowledge and power through a pact with the devil, Mephistopheles. Both Faust and Prometheus challenge divine boundaries, ultimately facing severe consequences for their transgressions.
The Vainakh hero Pkharmat brought fire to mankind and was chained to Mount Kazbek as punishment.


=== Oceania ===
In Polynesian myth, Māui is the thief of fire. There are many variations of the myth. In the version told in New Zealand, an ancestress of Maui is the keeper of fire, and she stores it in her fingernails and toenails. Maui nearly tricks her into giving him all of her nails, but she catches onto him and throws her last toenail down, engulfing the ground in flame and nearly killing Maui.
In the mythology of the Wurundjeri people of Australia, it was the Crow who stole the secret of fire from the Karatgurk women.


== Nuclear weapons ==
Since shortly after the detonation of the first atomic bombs, the destructive power of atomic weapons has been compared to the story of Prometheus and the theft of fire.
F. L. Campbell wrote in ""Science on the March: Atomic Thunderbolts"", in the September 1945 issue of The Scientific Monthly:

Modern Prometheans have raided Mount Olympus again and have brought back for man the very thunderbolts of Zeus.
The biography of Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin is entitled American Prometheus in reference to the myth. Further comparisons to Prometheus have been made in publications by the United Nations, MIT's Technology Review and Harvard's Nuclear Study Group.
The ""theft of fire"" metaphor has also been used to argue against the proliferation of nuclear weapons by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and repeatedly by statesman Henry Kissinger as early as 1957, at the Munich Security Conference and as part of the Nuclear Threat Initiative with former Senator Sam Nunn, former Secretary of Defense William Perry and former Secretary of State George Shultz. Supporters of nuclear power have interpreted the anecdote more favorably.

Money burning,"Money burning or burning money is the purposeful act of destroying money. In the prototypical example, banknotes are destroyed by setting them on fire. Burning money decreases the wealth of the owner without directly  enriching any particular party. It also reduces the money supply and (very slightly) slows down the inflation rate.
Money is usually burned to communicate a message, either for artistic effect, as a form of protest, or as a signal. In some games, a player can sometimes benefit from the ability to burn money (battle of the sexes). The burning of money is illegal in some jurisdictions.


== Macroeconomic effect ==
For the purposes of macroeconomics, burning money is equivalent to removing the money from circulation, and locking it away forever; the salient feature is that no one may ever use the money again. Burning money shrinks the money supply, and is therefore a special case of contractionary monetary policy that can be implemented by anyone. In the usual case, the central bank withdraws money from circulation by selling government bonds or foreign currency. The difference with money burning is that the central bank does not have to exchange any assets of value for the money burnt. Money burning is thus equivalent to gifting the money back to the central bank (or other money issuing authority). If the economy is at full employment equilibrium, shrinking the money supply causes deflation (or decreases the rate of inflation), increasing the real value of the money left in circulation.
Assuming that the burned money is paper money with negligible intrinsic value, no real goods are destroyed, so the overall wealth of the world is unaffected. Instead, all surviving money slightly increases in value; everyone gains wealth in proportion to the amount of money they already hold. Economist Steven Landsburg proposes in The Armchair Economist that burning one's fortune (in paper money) is a form of philanthropy more egalitarian than deeding it to the United States Treasury. In 1920, Thomas Nixon Carver wrote that dumping money into the sea is better for society than spending it wastefully, as the latter wastes the labor that it hires.


=== Opposites ===
Central banks routinely collect and destroy worn-out coins and banknotes in exchange for new ones. This does not affect the money supply, and is done to maintain a healthy population of usable currency. The practice raises an interesting possibility. If an individual can steal the money before it is incinerated, the effect is the opposite of burning money; the thief is enriched at the expense of the rest of society. One such incident at the Bank of England inspired the 2001 TV movie Hot Money and the 2008 film Mad Money.
Another, more common near-opposite is the creation of counterfeit money. Undetected counterfeit decreases the value of existing money—one of the reasons why attempting to pass it is illegal in most jurisdictions and is aggressively investigated. Another way to analyze the cost of forgery is to consider the effects of a central bank's monetary policy. Taking the United States as an example, if the Federal Reserve decides that the monetary base should be a given amount, then every $100 bill forged is a bill the Fed cannot print and use to buy Treasury bonds. The interest earnings (after expenses) on those bonds is turned over to the US Treasury, so any lost interest must be made up by U.S. taxpayers, who therefore bear the cost of counterfeiting.


== Rationales ==
Behaviorally speaking, burning money is usually seen as a purely negative act. The cognitive impact of burning money can even be a useful motivational tool: patients who suffer from nail biting may be trained to burn a dollar bill every time they engage in the habit. One study found this form of suppression training by self-punishment to be effective compared to control groups, although not as effective as substitution training.
On the other hand, there are some situations where burning money might not be so unreasonable. It is said that the ancient Greek philosopher Aristippus was once on a ship at sea when he was threatened by pirates; he took out his money, counted it, and dropped it into the sea, commenting, ""Better for the money to perish because of Aristippus than vice versa."" Cicero would later cite this episode as an example of a circumstance that must be considered in its full context: ""...it is a useless act to throw money into the sea; but not with the design which Aristippus had when he did so.""
Since around 2015 the UK has experienced a surge of interest in money burning. This has been noted in both the book The Mysterium  and in a Kindred Spirit article that is reprinted in International Times. An annual Mass Burn Event - where people are invited to burn money - is held at the Cockpit Theatre in London every autumn.


=== Symbolism ===

Publicly burning money can be an act of protest or a kind of artistic statement. Often the point is to emphasize money's intrinsic worthlessness.
In 1984, Serge Gainsbourg burned a 500 French franc note on television to protest against heavy taxation.
On 23 August 1994, the K Foundation (an art duo consisting of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty) burned one million pounds sterling in cash on the Scottish island of Jura. This money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as The KLF, one of the United Kingdom's most successful pop groups of the early 1990s. The duo have never fully explained their motivations for the burning.
In the 1995 film Dead Presidents, the title sequence directed by Kyle Cooper features close shots of burning U.S. bills; it took two days of shooting and experimenting with the paper to get the effect right.
In the early 18th century, New York City courts would publicly burn the counterfeit bills they gathered, to show that they were both dangerous and worthless.
In traditional Chinese and Vietnamese ancestor veneration, imitation money in the form of joss paper are ceremonially burned, with the aspiration that the dead may use the money to finance a more comfortable afterlife.
In 2010, the spokesperson for the Swedish Feminist Initiative, Gudrun Schyman, burned SEK 100,000 during a speech about the inequality in wages for men and women.
In 2018, a collective of artists called Distributed Gallery have created a machine named Chaos Machine which burns banknotes and turns them into cryptocurrencies while playing music.


=== Game theory ===
In game theory, a threat to burn money can affect the strategies of the players involved; a classic example is the situation described as 'battle of the sexes', where the ability to burn money allows the player to achieve the desired equilibrium without actually having to burn money.


=== For commodity value ===
Fiat money can sometimes be destroyed by converting it into commodity form, rather than completely forfeiting the value of the money. Sometimes, currency intended for use as fiat money becomes more valuable as a commodity, usually when inflation causes its face value to fall below its intrinsic value. For example, in India in 2007, Rupee coins disappeared from the market when their face value dropped below the value of the stainless steel from which they were made. Similarly, in 1965, the US government had to switch from silver to copper-nickel clad quarter coins because the silver value of the coins had exceeded their face value and were being melted down by individuals for profit. The same occurred to 5-franc coins of Switzerland, which up to the year 1969 were minted using a silver alloy. At the peak of hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, people burned banknotes for warmth, as their face value had fallen below their value as fuel.


== Legality ==
The legality of money burning varies with jurisdiction.


=== Australia ===
Section 16 of the Crimes (Currency) Act 1981 prohibits deliberate damage and destruction of Australian money without a relevant legal permit. The law covers both current Australian money and historical coins and notes.  Breaking this law can lead to detention or a fine.
According to this law, even writing words on a banknote can be punished.


=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, whether it is illegal for a person to burn his or her own money is a controversial topic. It is not mentioned explicitly in Brazilian law. João Sidney Figueiredo Filho, the head of the central bank, has affirmed that ""when money is inside the Central Bank, then it is the property of the National Treasury. When it leaves, it is not."" But the chief of police Jéferson Botelho Pereira has concluded that ""whoever rips money is committing a crime against the property of the Union"".
The production of paper money by the State Bank is under the exclusive authority of the Central Bank, and is issued by the Brazilian Union.  By that reasoning, the paper on which the money is printed is the property of the State, and its intrinsic value belongs to the person.  Articles 98 and 99 of the New Brazilian Civil Code give ""money"" its own definition.  This is because a banknote cannot become a common good, if the owner himself decides to keep it in his possession indefinitely.  This makes money different from other state assets such as rivers, seas, streets, roads and piazzas, which are all immobile.


=== Canada ===
The Currency Act states that ""no person shall melt down, break up or use otherwise than as currency any coin that is legal tender in Canada."" 
Similarly, Section 456 of The Criminal Code of Canada says: ""Every one who (a) defaces a current coin, or (b) utters a current coin that has been defaced, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.""
However neither the Currency Act nor Criminal Code mention paper currency. It therefore remains legal to completely destroy paper currency.


=== Euro Zone ===
According to the European Commission's Recommendation dated 22 March 2010, ""Member states must not prohibit or punish the complete destruction of small quantities of Euro coins or notes when this happens in private.  However they must prohibit the unauthorised destruction of large amounts of Euro coins or notes."" Also, ""Member states must not encourage the mutilation of Euro notes or coins for artistic purposes, but they are required to tolerate it.  Mutilated coins or notes should be considered unfit for circulation.""
The European Union defines ""falsifying or fraudulently altering money in any way"" as a crime.  Also, according to the EU ruling 1210/2010, ""all money that is unfit for circulation must be delivered to the relevant national authority"".  EU countries must remove the currency from circulation and reimburse the holder"", no matter what the country of issue.
The European Central Bank has established that ""Member states may refuse to reimburse Euro money that has been deliberately rendered unfit for circulation, or where it has been caused by a process that would predictably have led to the money becoming unfit.  The exception to this is money collected for charitable purposes, such as coins thrown into a fountain"".  The ECB legal department also states ""the ECB will refuse to replace money that has been stamped for advertising purposes"".
The European Union provides an obligation at the community level to retire ""neutralized"" notes from circulation, or those rendered unfit for security systems.


=== New Zealand ===
Section 154 of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 2021 makes it an offence to wilfully deface, disfigure, or mutilate any bank note in New Zealand. The penalty is a fine of up to NZ$1,000.


=== Singapore ===
Singapore's Currency Act states that any person who mutilate, destroy, deface, or causes any change (to diminish value/utility of) currency note or coin is fined up to $2,000.


=== Taiwan ===

Intentionally damaging coins or notes, and rendering them unusable, is fined up to 5 times the nominal value of such coins or notes.


=== Turkey ===
In Turkey, defacement or destruction of banknotes can be punished with fines or with prison sentences.


=== United Kingdom ===
The Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom relating to banknotes. Among other things, it makes it a criminal offence to deface a banknote (but not to destroy one).
Under Section 10 of the Coinage Act 1971 ""No person shall, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Treasury, melt down or break up any metal coin which is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or which, having been current there, has at any time after 16th May 1969 ceased to be so."" As the process of creating elongated coins does not require them to be melted nor broken up, however, Section 10 does not apply and coin elongation is legal within the UK with penny press machines.


=== United States ===

In the United States, burning banknotes is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. § 333: Mutilation of national bank obligations, which includes ""any other thing"" that renders a note ""unfit to be reissued"". In an amicus brief for Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, Solicitor General Seth Waxman writes that arresting an individual who removes the corner dollar values ""may expose a counterfeiting operation"". It is unclear if the statute has ever been applied in response to the complete destruction of a bill. Certainly people have publicly burned small amounts of money for political protests that were picked up by the media — Living Things at South by Southwest, Larry Kudlow on The Call, both in 2009 — without apparent consequence.
The question of legality has been compared to the much more politically charged issue of flag desecration. It can be argued that the desecration of the flag is comparable to the desecration of a photograph of Legal Tender (provided it was modified as to not violate counterfeiting laws). In 1989, in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Flag Protection Act, William Barr testified that any regulation protecting something purely for its symbolic value would be struck down as unconstitutional. The Senate report recommending passage of the Act argued that Barr's theory would render 18 U.S.C. § 333 unconstitutional as well. In a dissent in Smith v. Goguen, Justice Rehnquist counted 18 U.S.C. § 333 in a group of statutes in which the Government protects its interest in some private property which is ""not a traditional property interest"". On the other hand, the Government's interest in protecting circulating currency might not be purely symbolic; it costs the Bureau of Engraving and Printing approximately 5 cents to replace a note.
Legal Tender, a 1996 telerobotic art installment by Ken Goldberg, Eric Paulos, Judith Donath, and Mark Pauline, was an experiment to see if the law could instill a sense of physical risk in online interactions. After participants were advised that 18 U.S.C. § 333 threatened them with up to six months in jail, they were given the option of remotely defacing small portions of a pair of ""purportedly authentic"" $100 bills over the web. A crime may be occurring — but ""only if the bills are real, the web site is authentic, and the experiment actually performed."" In fact, one bill was real and the other counterfeit. Almost all of the participants reported that they believed the experiment and the bills to be faked.
The destruction of money is also bound by the same laws that govern the destruction of other personal property. In particular, one cannot empower the executor of one's estate to burn one's money after one dies.
