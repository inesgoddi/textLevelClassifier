Metonic cycle,"The Metonic cycle is a period of about 19 years used in astronomy and calendar studies. In particular, it is often used in the structure of lunisolar calendars, because 19 solar years is almost exactly the same length of time as 235 lunar months.


== History ==
The Metonic cycle is named for the astronomer Meton of Athens, who used the cycle in the calendar of Attica in the 5th century BC. But it was used in the calendar of many ancient cultures, including Babylonia and China, before then.


== Using the Metonic cycle in a calendar ==
Nineteen years of 12 lunar months each would last a total of 
  
    
      
        19
        ×
        12
        =
        228
      
    
    {\displaystyle 19\times 12=228}
  
 lunar months. But from astronomy we know that 19 solar years are the same length as 
  
    
      
        235
      
    
    {\displaystyle 235}
  
 lunar months. So over 19 years, 
  
    
      
        235
        −
        228
        =
        7
      
    
    {\displaystyle 235-228=7}
  
 extra lunar months need to be added to make the years line up correctly. Adding a thirteenth month in a year is called intercalation. There are different ways to do it:

The ancient Babylonian calendar and the modern Hebrew (Jewish) calendar add an extra month just before the spring equinox on a regular schedule of years:  years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19 of each 19-year cycle
The modern Chinese calendar, and other Asian calendars that follow it, use a calculation of solar periods and moon phases to decide when to add the extra month
Other cultures use observation—for example, seeing if a crop is ripe—to decide when to add an extra month. The calculation of the date of Easter uses the astronomical observation of the spring equinox to determine whether the following Easter will come 12 or 13 lunar months after the last one.


== Metonic cycle and eclipses ==
A Metonic cycle is close to the length of 20 eclipse years. For that reason, some eclipses repeat for a time at 19-year intervals.

Underwater sculpture,"Underwater art refers to artworks that are designed for or performed in an underwater environment. Underwater art often contributes to or is inspired by state of the art scientific discoveries about subaquatic properties, such as underwater vision or underwater acoustics.


== Underwater music ==
Underwater music is a form of music composition that is tailored to the specific behavior of sound underwater. Underwater music can be performed or recorded underwater, for example in a swimming pool. The audience listens to underwater music either under or above the surface of the water, depending on how the music is played back.

A Florida Underwater Music Festival took place on Saturday July 9, 2022, in the Florida Keys.


== Underwater sculpture ==
Underwater sculpture is a form of sculpture that is meant to be displayed underwater. The Cancun underwater museum has specialized into exhibiting underwater sculptures made of pH-neutral cement. This type of underwater sculpture favors the regeneration of coral reefs and the growth of marine life, which is carefully monitored through bioacoustic recording. The museum visitors include snorkelers and divers. The urban artist Invader installed 3 space invaders in the Cancun underwater museum.


== Underwater painting ==
Underwater painting is a specific painting technique, which adapts painting materials, techniques, tools, and exhibition to the subaquatic conditions. André Alban was the first underwater painter. He developed his technique as part of the many inventions he created when working with Jacques Cousteau. Hussain Ihfal has adopted this painting technique in the Maldives.


== Underwater video ==
Alex Frost released a series of underwater art videos in which he opens various products underwater.


== Underwater performance ==

Underwater performance is a type of site-specific artistic actions in or underwater. An artwork like Big Water is a typical artwork for the genre - within this syntax available as both video art (see above) and performance art - carefully observed and crafted out primarily underwater. Here - the selected action is immensed as a non-visiting performance, by virtue of the underwater presence, and is thus - with the observers taken into account - a filmed act preserved as video art.

Pericopsis elata,"Pericopsis elata is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is known by the common names African teak, afromosia, afrormosia, kokrodua and assamela. 


== Description ==
The species grows to 30-45m tall with a trunk of 1–1.8m in diameter. Annual diameter increases between unlogged and logged areas have been shown to be similar. It is a deciduous species that flowers at the end of the main dry season. The minimum trunk diameter for reproduction is given as 32 cm, while that for effective flowering is 37 cm. The fruit take 7 months to mature.
Despite its relatively small diameter, trees can live to be over 400 years old.


== Range ==
The species is native to moist, semi-deciduous forests in Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, DRC, Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Nigeria. Up until the mid 20th century, the tree was commonly found in its native range. However, after its wood was introduced to world markets in 1948, its range quickly diminished. It can no longer be found in the Ivory Coast and only small pockets remain in other countries besides the DRC where it is still threatened.


== Ecology ==
The seed pods are eaten by birds and monkeys while the seeds themselves provide food to beetles. Flowers provide homes for butterflies. The crowns of the trees provide shade and shelter to many understory plant species. Its fire resistant bark and nitrogen fixing roots make it an important pioneer species for areas damaged by fires.


== Uses ==
The tree produces hardwood timber of high commercial value due to its texture, strength, density and durability. It is used in the manufacture of boats, veneer, and furniture.


== Stocks and extraction ==
The DRC has the world's largest remaining stocks of Afrormosia, which are largely confined to the Équateur and Orientale Provinces.
Illegal logging and habitat loss pose a realistic threat to the afrormosia, which ranks among the most valued hard tropical timber species. Following decades of extraction in the 20th and 21st century, it is ranked CITES Appendix II. This implies that it is subject to trade regulation because it is recognised that unregulated trade puts the species at risk of extinction. The factors that control its population dynamics are however imperfectly known. With a minimum logging diameter of 90 cm, full recovery is expected over a 30-year period. Selective logging of 12% of seed trees has been shown to have little influence on its survival. Sustainability is believed to be best achieved by purposeful actions to ensure regeneration after logging.

Premixed flame,"A premixed flame is a flame formed under certain conditions during the combustion of a premixed charge (also called pre-mixture) of fuel and oxidiser. Since the fuel and oxidiser—the key chemical reactants of combustion—are available throughout a homogeneous stoichiometric premixed charge, the combustion process once initiated sustains itself by way of its own heat release. The majority of the chemical transformation in such a combustion process occurs primarily in a thin interfacial region which separates the unburned and the burned gases. The premixed flame interface propagates through the mixture until the entire charge is depleted. The propagation speed of a premixed flame is known as the flame speed (or burning velocity) which depends on the convection-diffusion-reaction balance within the flame, i.e. on its inner chemical structure. The premixed flame is characterised as laminar or turbulent depending on the velocity distribution in the unburned pre-mixture (which provides the medium of propagation for the flame).


== Premixed flame propagation ==


=== Laminar ===
Under controlled conditions (typically in a laboratory) a laminar flame may be formed in one of several possible flame configurations. The inner structure of a laminar premixed flame is composed of layers over which the decomposition, reaction and complete oxidation of fuel occurs. These chemical processes are much faster than the physical processes such as vortex motion in the flow and, hence, the inner structure of a laminar flame remains intact in most circumstances. The constitutive layers of the inner structure correspond to specified intervals over which the temperature increases from the specified unburned mixture up to as high as the adiabatic flame temperature (AFT). In the presence of volumetric heat transfer and/or aerodynamic stretch, or under the development intrinsic flame instabilities, the extent of reaction and, hence, the temperature attained across the flame may be different from the AFT.

Variations in local propagation speed of a laminar flame arise due to what is called flame stretch. Flame stretch can happen due to the straining by outer flow velocity field or the curvature of flame; the difference in the propagation speed from the corresponding laminar speed is a function of these effects and may be written as:

=== Turbulent ===
In practical scenarios, turbulence is inevitable and, under moderate conditions, turbulence aids the premixed burning process as it enhances the mixing process of fuel and oxidiser. If the premixed charge of gases is not homogeneously mixed, the variations on equivalence ratio may affect the propagation speed of the flame. In some cases, this is desirable as in stratified combustion of blended fuels.
A turbulent premixed flame can be assumed to propagate as a surface composed of an ensemble of laminar flames so long as the processes that determine the inner structure of the flame are not affected. Under such conditions, the flame surface is wrinkled by virtue of turbulent motion in the premixed gases increasing the surface area of the flame. The wrinkling process increases the burning velocity of the turbulent premixed flame in comparison to its laminar counterpart.
The propagation of such a premixed flame may be analysed using the field equation called as G equation for a scalar 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 as:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              ∂
              G
            
            
              ∂
              t
            
          
        
        +
        
          v
        
        ⋅

        G
        =
        
          U
          
            L
          
        
        
          |
        
        ∇
        G
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial G}{\partial t}}+\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla G=U_{L}|\nabla G|}
  
,
which is defined such that the level-sets of G represent the various interfaces within the premixed flame propagating with a local velocity 
  
    
      
        
          U
          
            L
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U_{L}}
  
. This, however, is typically not the case as the propagation speed of the interface (with resect to unburned mixture) varies from point to point due to the aerodynamic stretch induced due to gradients in the velocity field.
Under contrasting conditions, however, the inner structure of the premixed flame may be entirely disrupted causing the flame to extinguish either locally (known as local extinction) or globally (known as global extinction or blow-off). Such opposing cases govern the operation of practical combustion devices such as SI engines as well as aero-engine afterburners. The prediction of the extent to which the inner structure of flame is affected in turbulent flow is a topic of extensive research.


== Premixed flame configuration ==
The flow configuration of premixed gases affects the stabilization and burning characteristics of the


=== Bunsen flame ===
In a Bunsen flame, a steady flow rate is provided which matches the flame speed so as to stabilize the flame. If the flow rate is below the flame speed, the flame will move upstream until the fuel is consumed or until it encounters a flame holder. If the flow rate is equal to the flame speed, we would expect a stationary flat flame front normal to the flow direction. If the flow rate is above the flame speed, the flame front will become conical such that the component of the velocity vector normal to the flame front is equal to the flame speed.


=== Stagnation flame ===
Here, the pre-mixed gases flow in such a way so as to form a region of stagnation (zero velocity) where the flame may be stabilized.


=== Spherical flame ===
In this configuration, the flame is typically initiated by way of a spark within a homogeneous pre-mixture. The subsequent propagation of the developed premixed flame occurs as a spherical front until the mixture is transformed entirely or the walls of the combustion vessel are reached.


== Applications ==
Since the equivalence ratio of the premixed gases may be controlled, premixed combustion offers a means to attain low temperatures and, thereby, reduce NOx emissions. Due to improved mixing in comparison with diffusion flames, soot formation is mitigated as well. Premixed combustion has therefore gained significance in recent times. The uses involve lean-premixed-prevaporized (LPP) gas turbines and SI engines.

Stellar archaeology,"Stellar archaeology is the study of the early history of the universe, based on its early composition. By examining the chemical abundances of the earliest stars in the universe: metal-poor, Population II stars; insights are gained into their earlier, metal-free, Population III progenitors. This sheds light on such processes as galaxy formation and evolution, early star formation, nucleosynthesis in stars and supernovae, and the formation processes of the galactic halo. The field has already discovered that the Milky Way cannibalizes surrounding dwarf galaxies, giving it a youthful appearance.

Money to Burn (performance art),"Money to Burn was a work of performance art executed on June 22, 2010, in which Dread Scott burned $171 in US dollar bills in front of the New York Stock Exchange.
Scott filmed himself repeatedly singing ""money to bur-rn, money to burn"" while burning one bill at a time with a Zippo lighter, both from the $250 in small bills attached to his clothes, and from bills solicited from passers-by.
Describing the performance, Scott said ""I did the one thing you shouldn't do with money: burn it. Burning it is the one thing that everyone thinks is just crazy. But I was doing in extremely small form what happens on the stock exchange daily on a much grander scale.""
After 25 minutes, the New York Police Department intervened and issued Scott a summons for disorderly conduct, which he fought in court.

Aerospike engine,"The aerospike engine is a type of rocket engine that maintains its aerodynamic efficiency across a wide range of altitudes. It belongs to the class of altitude compensating nozzle engines. Aerospike engines were proposed for many single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) designs. They were a contender for the Space Shuttle main engine. However, as of 2023 no such engine was in commercial production, although some large-scale aerospikes were in testing phases.
The term aerospike was originally used for a truncated plug nozzle with a rough conical taper and some gas injection, forming an ""air spike"" to help make up for the absence of the plug tail. However, a full-length plug nozzle may also be called an aerospike.


== Principles ==
The purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction, generating thrust in the opposite direction. The exhaust, a high-temperature mix of gases, has an effectively random momentum distribution (i.e., the exhaust pushes in any direction it can).  If the exhaust is allowed to escape in this form, only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction and thus contribute to forward thrust.  The bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction.  Ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust, helping to keep it moving in the ""right"" direction as it exits the engine.  As the vehicle travels upward through the atmosphere, ambient air pressure is reduced.  This causes the thrust-generating exhaust to begin to expand outside the edge of the bell.  Since this exhaust begins traveling in the ""wrong"" direction (i.e., outward from the main exhaust plume), the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine.  An aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency.

Instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell, an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion, the ""spike"", which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell. The spike forms one side of a ""virtual"" bell, with the other side being formed by the outside air.
The idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike. Exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient. Since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient, this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle.  It gives no overall thrust, but this part of the nozzle also doesn't lose thrust by forming a partial vacuum.  The thrust at the base part of the nozzle can be ignored at low altitude.
As the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes, the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases, as does the drag in front of the vehicle. The recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 bar, higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle, thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases.  This effectively behaves like an ""altitude compensator"" in that the size of the bell automatically compensates as air pressure falls.
The disadvantages of aerospikes seem to be extra weight for the spike. Furthermore, the larger cooled area can reduce performance below theoretical levels by reducing the pressure against the nozzle. Aerospikes work relatively poorly between Mach 1–3, where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure, thus reducing the thrust.


=== Variations ===
Several versions of the design exist, differentiated by their shapes. In the toroidal aerospike the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim. In theory this requires an infinitely long spike for best efficiency, but by blowing a small amount of gas out of the center of a shorter truncated spike (like base bleed in an artillery shell), something similar can be achieved.
In the linear aerospike the spike consists of a tapered wedge-shaped plate, with exhaust exiting on either side at the ""thick"" end. This design has the advantage of being stackable, allowing several smaller engines to be placed in a row to make one larger engine while augmenting steering performance with the use of individual engine throttle control.


== Performance ==
Rocketdyne conducted a lengthy series of tests in the 1960s on various designs. Later models of these engines were based on their highly reliable J-2 engine machinery and provided the same sort of thrust levels as the conventional engines they were based on; 200,000 lbf (890 kN) in the J-2T-200k, and 250,000 lbf (1.1 MN) in the J-2T-250k (the T refers to the toroidal combustion chamber). Thirty years later their work was revived for use in NASA's X-33 project. In this case the slightly upgraded J-2S engine machinery was used with a linear spike, creating the XRS-2200. After more development and considerable testing, this project was cancelled when the X-33's composite fuel tanks repeatedly failed.

Three XRS-2200 engines were built during the X-33 program and underwent testing at NASA's Stennis Space Center. The single-engine tests were a success, but the program was halted before the testing for the two-engine setup could be completed. The XRS-2200 produces 204,420 lbf (909,300 N) thrust with an Isp of 339 seconds at sea level, and 266,230 lbf (1,184,300 N) thrust with an Isp of 436.5 seconds in a vacuum.
The RS-2200 Linear Aerospike Engine was derived from the XRS-2200. The RS-2200 was to power the VentureStar single-stage-to-orbit vehicle. In the latest design, seven RS-2200s producing 542,000 pounds-force (2,410 kN) each would boost the VentureStar into low Earth orbit. The development on the RS-2200 was formally halted in early 2001 when the X-33 program did not receive Space Launch Initiative funding. Lockheed Martin chose to not continue the VentureStar program without any funding support from NASA. An engine of this type is on outdoor display on the grounds of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama.

The cancellation of the Lockheed Martin X-33 by the federal government in 2001 decreased funding availability, but aerospike engines remain an area of active research. For example, a milestone was achieved when a joint academic/industry team from California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) and Garvey Spacecraft Corporation successfully conducted a flight test of a liquid-propellant powered aerospike engine in the Mojave Desert on September 20, 2003. CSULB students had developed their Prospector 2 (P-2) rocket using a 1,000 lbf (4.4 kN) LOX/ethanol aerospike engine. This work on aerospike engines continues; Prospector-10, a ten-chamber aerospike engine, was test-fired June 25, 2008.

Further progress came in March 2004 when two successful tests sponsored by the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center using high-power rockets manufactured by Blacksky Corporation, based in Carlsbad, California. The aerospike nozzles and solid rocket motors were developed and built by the rocket motor division of Cesaroni Technology Incorporated, north of Toronto, Ontario. The two rockets were solid-fuel powered and fitted with non-truncated toroidal aerospike nozzles. Flown at the Pecos County Aerospace Development Center, Fort Stockton, Texas, the rockets achieved apogees of 26,000 ft (7,900 m) and speeds of about Mach 1.5.
Small-scale aerospike engine development using a hybrid rocket propellant configuration has been ongoing by members of the Reaction Research Society.
In 2020 the TU Dresden and Fraunhofer IWS started their CFDμSAT-Project for research on additively manufactured aerospike-engines. A prototype has already been tested in a test cell at TU Dresden's Institute of Aerospace Engineering, achieving a
burn time of 30 seconds.


== Implementations ==


=== Firefly Aerospace ===
In July 2014 Firefly Space Systems announced its planned Alpha launcher that uses an aerospike engine for its first stage. Intended for the small satellite launch market, it is designed to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) at a price of US$8–9 million, much lower than with conventional launchers.
Firefly Alpha 1.0 was designed to carry payloads of up to 400 kilograms (880 lb). It uses carbon composite materials and uses the same basic design for both stages. The plug-cluster aerospike engine puts out 90,000 pounds-force (400 kN) of thrust. The engine has a bell-shaped nozzle that has been cut in half, then stretched to form a ring with the half-nozzle now forming the profile of a plug.
This rocket design was never launched. The design was abandoned after Firefly Space Systems went bankrupt. A new company, Firefly Aerospace, has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the Alpha 2.0 design. However, the company has proposed Firefly Gamma, a partially reusable spaceplane with aerospike engines.


=== ARCA Space ===
In March 2017 ARCA Space Corporation announced their intention to build a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket, named Haas 2CA, using a linear aerospike engine. The rocket is designed to send up to 100 kg into low-Earth orbit, at a price of US$1 million per launch. They later announced that their Executor Aerospike engine would produce 50,500 pounds-force (225 kN) of thrust at sea level and 73,800 pounds-force (328 kN) of thrust in a vacuum.
In June 2017, ARCA announced that they would fly their Demonstrator3 rocket to space, also using a linear aerospike engine. This rocket was designed to test several components of their Haas 2CA at lower cost. They announced a flight for August 2017.  In September 2017, ARCA announced that, after being delayed, their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a Demonstrator3 rocket.
On December 20, 2019, ARCA tested the LAS 25DA aerospike steam rocket engine for the Launch Assist System.


=== KSF Space and Interstellar Space ===
Another spike engine concept model, by KSF Space and Interstellar Space in Los Angeles, was designed for orbital vehicle named SATORI. Due to lack of funding, the concept is still undeveloped.


=== Rocketstar ===
Rocketstar planned to launch its 3D-printed aerospike rocket to an altitude of 50 miles in February 2019 but canceled the mission three days ahead of liftoff citing safety concerns. They are working on a second launch attempt.


=== Pangea Aerospace ===
In November 2021, Spain-based Pangea Aerospace began hot-fire testing of its small-scale demonstration methane-oxygen aerospike engine DemoP1.

After successfully testing the demonstrator DemoP1, Pangea plans to up-scale to the 300 kN ARCOS engine.


=== Stoke Space ===
Headquartered in Kent, Washington, Stoke Space is building and testing a distributed architecture LH2/LOX aerospike system for its reusable second stage.


=== Polaris Spaceplanes ===
The Bremen-based German startup POLARIS Raumflugzeuge GmbH received a Bundeswehr contract to design and flight test a linear aerospike engine in April 2023. The company is set to test this new engine on board of its fourth spaceplane demonstrator, DEMO-4 MIRA, in late 2023 at Peenemünde, the same place where the V-2 ballistic missiles were developed. If successful, MIRA will be the first aerospace vehicle to be powered by a linear aerospike rocket engine during flight.


=== Bath Rocket Team ===
Based at the University of Bath, the Bath Rocket Team has been developing their own hybrid rocket engine with an aerospike nozzle since 2020. The engine was first tested at the UK Race to Space National Propulsion Competition in 2023. The team is developing a flight-ready version of the engine they are planning to fly for the first time at EuRoC24. 


=== SpaceFields ===
SpaceFields, incubated at IISc, has successfully tested India's first AeroSpike Rocket Engine at its Challakere facility on 11-Sep-2024. The engine achieved a peak thrust of 2000N and featured altitude compensation for optimal efficiency.

Medical animation,"A medical animation is a short educational film, usually based around a physiological or surgical topic, that is rendered using 3D computer graphics. While it may be intended for an array of audiences, the medical animation is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients.
Early medical animations were limited to basic wire-frame models because of low processor speed. However, rapid evolution in microprocessor design and computer memory has led to animations that are significantly more intricate.
The medical animation may be viewed as a standalone visualization, or in combination with other sensory input devices, such as head-mounted displays, stereoscopic lenses, haptic gloves, interactive workstations, or Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVEs).


== History ==
Though evolved from the field of realistic medical illustrations (such as those created by Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in the 16th century), medical animations are also indebted to motion picture technology and computer-generated imagery.
The term medical animation predates the advent of computer-generated graphics by approximately three decades. Though the first computer animation was created at Bell Telephone Labs in 1963, the phrase ""medical animation"" appears in scholarly contexts as early as 1932 in the Journal of Biological Photography. As discussed by Clarke and Hoshall, the term referred to two-dimensional illustrated motion pictures produced for inclusion in films screened for medical students.
The creation of the computer-generated medical animation began in earnest in the early 1970s. The first description of the use of 3D computer graphics for a medical purpose can be found in an issue of the journal Science, dated 1975. Its authors, a team of researchers from the Departments of Chemistry and of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M University, described the potential uses of medical animation for visualizing complex macromolecules.
By the late 1980s, the medical animation had become a distinct modality of physiological and surgical instruction. By that point, researchers had suggested that the 3D medical animations could illustrate physiological, molecular or anatomical concepts that might otherwise be infeasible.
Today's medical animation industry comprises one facet of the non-entertainment computer animation industry, which has annual revenues of $15 billion per year worldwide.


== Applications ==


=== Patient Education ===
A growing trend among medical animation studios is the creation of clips focused on explaining surgical procedures or pharmaceutical mechanisms of action in terms simple enough for a layperson to understand. These animations may be found on hospital websites, in doctor's office workstations, online health websites, or via medical animation studios themselves. Such animations may also appear on television shows, OTT platforms and other popular entertainment venues as a way to educate an audience on a medical topic under discussion.
Occasionally, this form of animation is used in-hospital. In this context, clips may be used in order to get fully informed consent from patients facing surgery or medical treatment. Likewise, studies have suggested that patient-educating medical animations may be able to reduce the rate of accidental wrong-site surgeries.


=== Medical simulation ===
Due to both the relative scarcity of cadavers to be used for surgical instruction and to the dwindling use of animals and patients who have not given consent, institutes may utilize medical animations as a way to teach doctors-to-be anatomical and surgical concepts. Such simulations may be viewed passively (as in the case of 3D medical animations included via CD-ROM in medical textbook packages) or using interactive controls. The stimulation of hand-eye skills using haptics is another possible use of medical animation technology, one that stems from the replacement of cadavers in surgical classrooms with task trainers and mannequins.
The creation of proportionally accurate virtual bodies is often accomplished using medical scans, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Such techniques represent a cost- and time-saving move away from the creation of medical animations using sectioned cadavers. For instance, the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project created 3D medical animations of the male and female bodies by scanning cadavers using CT technology, after which they were frozen, shaved into millimeter-thick sections and recorded using high-resolution photographs.
By comparison, medical animations made using only scanned data can recreate the internal structures of live patients, often in the context of surgical planning.


=== Cellular and molecular animation ===
Medical animations are often employed as a method of visualizing the vast number of microscopic processes that occur in the human body. These may involve the interplay between organelles, the transcription of DNA, the molecular action of enzymes, the interactions between pathogens and white blood cells or virtually any other cellular or sub-cellular process.
Molecular animations are similar in that they depict structures that are too small for the human eye to see. However, this latter category is also capable of illustrating atomic structures, which are often too minute to be visualized with any clarity via microscopy.
Cellular animation can use models built manually or ones which originate from microscopy and subsequent polygonal 3d surface creation.


=== Pharmaceutical mechanism of action ===
As a way to explain how medications work, pharmaceutical manufacturers may provide mechanism of action animations, often through websites dedicated to specific prescription drugs. These medical visualizations typically do not represent cellular structures in a fully accurate or proportional way. Instead, mechanism of action animations may visually simplify the interaction between drug molecules and cells. These medical animations may also explain the physiological origins of the disease itself.


=== Emergency care instruction ===
Several studies have suggested that 3D medical animations may be used to instruct novices on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in an emergency. These reports usually suggest the use of pre-prepared, voice-narrated motion-capture animations that are viewed by means of a cellphone or other portable electronic device.


=== Forensic reconstruction ===
A number of applications for medical animations has been developed in the field of forensics. These include the so-called ""virtutopsy,"" or MRI-assisted virtual autopsy, of remains that are too damaged to be otherwise inspected or reconstructed. Likewise, medical animations can appear in courtrooms, be used as forensic  ""reconstructions"" of crime scenes or recreate the crimes themselves. The admissibility of such evidence is questionable.


=== Electronic or Interactive learning ===
Researchers have suggested that medical animations can be used to disseminate medical education materials electronically, allowing them to be accessed and utilized by professional and amateur health practitioners alike.


=== Surgical training and planning ===
Some institutes use animations both to teach medical students how to perform basic surgery, and to give seasoned surgeons the chance to expand their skill set. Multiple studies have been conducted on the effectiveness and feasibility of medical animation-based surgical pre-planning. Experimental animation tools have been created as integral technology in image-guided surgery as well. Today, surgical training uses medical animation combined with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and simulation.

Wood degradation,"Wood degradation is a complex process influenced by various biological, chemical, and environmental factors. It significantly impacts the durability and longevity of wood products and structures, necessitating effective preservation and protection strategies. It primarily involves fungi, bacteria, and insects. Fungi are the most significant agents, causing decay through the breakdown of wood's structural components, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.


== Prevention ==
Applying preservatives, such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA) or borates, can protect wood from biological and chemical degradation.
Coatings, such as paints, varnishes, and water repellents, provide a barrier against moisture and UV radiation. Advanced coatings containing UV stabilizers and biocides offer enhanced protection.

Wooden iron,"Wooden iron (German: hölzernes Eisen) is a polemical term often used in philosophical rhetoric to describe the impossibility of an opposing argument. The term is a German proverbial oxymoron, which synthesizes the concept of the ""wooden"", which is organic, with the concept of ""iron"" which is inorganic. Such a contradictio in adjecto is a logical inconsistency. It occurs when a modifying adjective opposes its noun, as in ""square circle,"" ""freezing fire,"" ""boiling snow,"" or ""hard liquid.""


== Overview ==
Arthur Schopenhauer used the term in The World as Will and Representation (1819) in his critiques of Immanuel Kant. For his argument against absolutes he wrote ""... the categorical imperative leaps into the world, in order to command there with its unconditioned ought—a scepter of wooden iron."" (See Payne's trans., WWR 1:523.)   His chapter titled ""On the Fundamental View of Idealism"" further describes his position on subjectivity by using the term to demonstrate the difference between ""the representation of the intellect"" and the ""subject"" itself.  In this imaginary dialogue between intellect and matter he wrote, as intellect speaking to matter: ""Whoever thinks me away, and then believes he can still think of you, is involved in a gross delusion; for your existence outside my representation is a direct contradiction, a wooden-iron."" (See Payne's trans., WWR 2:17.)
Friedrich Nietzsche, who was an avid Schopenhauer scholar, continued to employ the term throughout his writings in the latter half of the 19th century. Nietzsche's experience with philology also brought new meaning to the term. He attacked Moritz Carrière's so-called ""real idealism"" (see Notebooks Fall 1873—Winter 1873-74 30[16]). He used it to describe Richard Wagner's ""infinite melody"" (see Notebooks Fall 1881 11[198]). He also considered ""unegoistic actions"" and ""unegoistic drives"" to be examples of wooden iron (see Notebooks Summer-Fall 1884 26[224]). He similarly dismissed philosophical concepts of ""pure knowledge"" and ""thing in itself"" (see Notebooks Summer-Fall 1884 26[413]). The term was also employed in his poetic attempts to criticize socialism and the building of a ""free society"" (see Book 5 of The Gay Science, §356).

ZoneAlarm,"ZoneAlarm is a software firewall originally developed by Zone Labs, which was acquired in March 2004 by Check Point. It includes an inbound intrusion detection system, as well as the ability to control which programs can create outbound connections—the latter not available in the Windows XP Service Pack 2 firewall. As of early 2009, the newest release is ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2009. ZoneAlarm was formerly known as Zone Labs, the usage of which is declining.


== Features ==
In ZoneAlarm, program access is controlled by way of ""zones"", into which all computer networking connections are divided. The ""trusted zone"" generally includes the user's local area network and can share resources such as files and printers, while the ""Internet zone"" includes everything not in the trusted zone. The user can specify which ""permissions"" (trusted zone client, trusted zone server, Internet zone client, Internet zone server) to give to a program before it attempts to access the Internet (e.g. before running it for the first time) or, alternatively, ZoneAlarm will ask the user to give the program permission on its first access attempt.


=== True Vector Internet Monitor ===
""True Vector Internet Monitor"", also known as ""TrueVector Security Engine"", is the core of ZoneAlarm. It is a Windows service which runs as ""vsmon.exe"" in the processes list. This monitors internet traffic and generates alerts for disallowed access.


=== Operating System Firewall ===
Operating System Firewall, OSFirewall for short, is a feature in ZoneAlarm paid versions only. This monitors programs and generates alerts when they perform suspicious behaviors.


=== SmartDefense Advisor ===
SmartDefense Advisor is a service only available in premium versions of ZoneAlarm that helps the user with certain types of alerts. This utilizes a large database of trusted program signatures in order to provide the user with further advice upon requests from the program in regards to allowing or denying access to the Internet.


== Versions ==
64-bit versions of the ZoneAlarm product line will be made available for Windows Vista in the first half of 2009.

ZoneAlarm Extreme: A comprehensive version of Internet Security Suite that includes ForceField. It is currently in undergoing beta testing, but is available for download.
ZoneAlarm: A freeware version which includes a web and local network firewall with outbound program control and port stealthing.
ZoneAlarm Pro: This offers a OS Firewall identity protection, pop-up ad blocker, adware detection, cookie blocker. It does not have Antivirus features.
ZoneAlarm Anti-Spyware: Includes all the features of ZoneAlarm Pro, as well as privacy and identity theft features.
ZoneAlarm Antivirus: Includes ZoneAlarm firewall and antivirus protection provided by Kaspersky Labs.
ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite: Includes all the features of every product with additional IM security and an anti-spam filter engine provided by MailFrontier and a parental control. It is the most expensive ZoneAlarm product.
ZoneAlarm Force Field: A virtualization engine that shields the computer and personal data from Internet and computer-based threats. It includes several layers of protection to combat phishing, spyware and dangerous file downloads.


=== Discontinued versions ===
ZoneAlarm Plus: Discontinued from late 2004 for having fewer features than ZoneAlarm Pro but selling for almost the same price.
ZoneAlarm Wireless Security: Discontinued on October 19, 2005, because its functions were included in all paid versions of ZoneAlarm from version 6 onwards.

Firefighting,"Firefighting is a profession aimed at controlling and extinguishing fire. A person who engages in firefighting is known as a firefighter or fireman. Firefighters typically undergo a high degree of technical training. This involves structural firefighting and wildland firefighting. Specialized training includes aircraft firefighting, shipboard firefighting, aerial firefighting, maritime firefighting, and proximity firefighting.
Firefighting is a dangerous profession due to the toxic environment created by combustible materials, with major risks being smoke, oxygen deficiency, elevated temperatures, poisonous atmospheres, and violent air flows. To combat some of these risks, firefighters carry self-contained breathing apparatus. Additional hazards include falls – a constant peril while navigating unfamiliar layouts or confined spaces amid shifting debris under limited visibility – and structural collapse that can exacerbate the problems encountered in a toxic environment.
The first step in a firefighting operation is reconnaissance to search for the origin of the fire and to identify the specific risks. Fires can be extinguished by water, fuel or oxidant removal, or chemical flame inhibition; though, because fires are classified depending on the elements involved, such as grease, paper, electrical, etcetera, a specific type of fire extinguisher may be required. The classification is based on the type of fires that the extinguisher is more suitable for. In the United States, the types of fire are described by the National Fire Protection Association.


== History ==

The earliest known firefighters were in the city of Rome. In 60 A.D., emperor Nero established a Corps of Vigils (Vigiles) to protect Rome after a disastrous fire. It consisted of 7,000 people equipped with buckets and axes who fought fires and served as police.


=== Historic tactics and tools ===
In the 3rd century B.C., an Alexandrian Greek named Ctesibius made a double force pump called a siphona. As water rose in the chamber, it compressed the air inside, which forced the water to eject in a steady stream through a pipe and nozzle.
In the 16th century, syringes were also used as firefighting tools, the larger ones being mounted on wheels. Another traditional firefighting method that survived was the bucket brigade, involving two lines of people formed between the water source and the fire. Typically, men in one of the lines would pass along the full buckets of water toward the fire while in the other line women and children would pass back the empty buckets to be refilled.
In the 17th century the first ""fire engines"" were made, notably in Amsterdam. In 1721, the English inventor Richard Newsham made a popular fire engine that was essentially a rectangular box on wheels filled using a bucket brigade to provide a reservoir while hand-powered pumps supplied sufficient water pressure to douse fires at a distance.


=== Ancient Rome ===
Ancient Rome did not have municipal firefighters. Instead, private individuals relied on their slaves or supporters to take action. They would not only form bucket brigades or attempt to smother smaller fires, but would also demolish or raze nearby buildings to slow the spread of the fire. However, there is no mention of fires being extinguished, rather they were contained and burned themselves out. Ancient Rome did not have an organized firefighting force until the Vigiles were formed during the reign of Augustus.
The first ever Roman fire brigade was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Fires were almost a daily occurrence in Rome, and Crassus took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department, by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the firefighters did nothing while Crassus offered to buy the burning building from the distressed property owner, at a miserable price. If the owner agreed to sell the property, his men would put out the fire; if the owner refused, then they would simply let the structure burn to the ground. After buying many properties this way, he rebuilt them, and often leased the properties to their original owners or new tenants.


=== United Kingdom ===
Prior to the Great Fire of London in 1666, some parishes in the UK had begun to organize rudimentary firefighting crews. After the Great Fire, Nicholas Barbon introduced the first fire insurance. In order to reduce insurance costs, Barbon also formed his own fire brigade, and other companies followed suit.
By the start of the 1800s, insured buildings were identified with a badge or mark indicating that they were eligible for a company's firefighting services. It is a common belief that buildings not insured with a particular company were left by its firefighters to burn, unless they happened to be adjacent to an insured building, in which case it was often in the company's interest to prevent the fire from spreading. This is a common misconception. In 1833 fire insurance companies in London merged to form The London Fire Company Establishment.
Steam-powered apparatuses were first introduced in the 1850s, allowing a greater quantity of water to be directed onto a fire; in the early 1930s they were superseded by versions powered by an internal combustion engine.
In World War II the Auxiliary Fire Service, and later the National Fire Service, were established to supplement local fire services. Before 1938, there was no countrywide standard for firefighting terms, procedures, ranks, or equipment (such as hose couplings). In the month of August in 1939 with war looking very possible the Fire Service's act of 1938 came into effect. This unified Great Britain's fire service and prepared them for the German war machine. During the London Blitz, 700 fire men and 20 fire women, as known during the time period died as a result of heavy bombing, 91 of these perished at the same time defending London. By the end of the London Blitz, 327 firefighters had lost their lives.


=== United States ===
In January 1608, a fire destroyed many colonists' provisions and lodgings in Jamestown, Virginia. By the mid-1600s, Boston, New Amsterdam (later New York City), and Philadelphia were all plagued by fires, and volunteer fire brigades began to form.

In 1736, Benjamin Franklin founded the Union Fire Company in Philadelphia, which became the standard for volunteer fire organizations. These firefighters had two critical tools: salvage bags and so-called bed keys. Salvage bags were used to quickly collect and save valuables, and bed keys were used to separate the wooden frame of a bed (often the most valuable item in a home at the time) into pieces for safe and rapid removal from the fire.
The first American attempt at fire insurance failed after a large fire in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1736. Later in 1740, Benjamin Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship to provide fire insurance, which was more successful. The Contributionship adopted ""fire marks"" to easily identify insured buildings. Firefighting started to become formalized with rules for providing buckets, ladders, and hooks, and with the formation of volunteer companies. A chain of command was also established.


== Firefighter duties ==

A firefighter's goals are to save lives, protect property, and protect the environment. A fire can rapidly spread and endanger many lives, but with modern firefighting techniques, catastrophe can often be avoided. To prevent fires from starting, a firefighter's duties may include public education about fire safety and conducting fire inspections of locations to verify their adherence to local fire codes.


=== Firefighter skills ===

Firefighting requires technical proficiency of operational tactics, equipment, and scene awareness. Firefighters must also have, or be able to acquire, knowledge of department organizations, operations, and procedures, and the district or city street system they will have to negotiate in order to perform their duties.
They must meet minimum physical fitness standards and learn various firefighting duties within a reasonable period
Examples are:

Building construction
Fire behavior
Firefighting PPE
Fire extinguishers
Ropes and knots
Ground ladders
Forcible entry
Search and rescue
Ventilation
Fire hose and streams
Fire suppression
Salvage and overhaul
Vehicle extrication and technical rescue
Hazardous materials response


=== Specialized skills ===

Specialized areas of operations may require subject-specific training.

Examples are:

Fire apparatus driver/operator - trained to drive fire apparatus to and from fires and other emergencies, operate fire-apparatus pumps and aerial devices, and maintain apparatus.
Hazardous materials technician - certified to mitigate hazardous materials emergencies.
Rescue technician - certified to perform complex technical rescues.
Airport firefighter - trained in ARFF.
Wildland firefighter - trained to extinguish fires in outdoor vegetation, including the wildland/urban interface.


=== Shift hours ===
Full-time career firefighters typically follow a 24-hour shift schedule, although some fire departments work 8- or 12-hour shifts. Australian firefighters work a 10/14 shift, in which the day shift works ten hours and the night shift works 14 hours. Firefighting personnel are split up into alternating shifts. Usually, the 24-hour shifts are followed by two days off. The shift personnel arrive for roll call at a specified time, ready to complete a regular tour of duty. While on shift, the firefighter remains at the fire station unless relieved or assigned other duties.


=== Fire wardens ===

In fire fighting, there are also people designated as fire wardens, also known as chief officers. Their duties vary, some may ensure evacuation of that part of the building for which they are responsible; others may be responsible for fire control in a particular area, direct a crew in the suppression of forest fires, or function as fire patrolmen in a logging area.
The chief officer is in charge of their firefighters during fires or emergencies, and is expected to command and control the overall situation while effectively combating a fire or other emergency. Chief officers must be able to evaluate their firefighters, use sound judgement when deciding when it is time to withdraw firefighters from a fire, and react calmly in emergency situations. The chief officer must direct the activities of a fire department and supervise all firefighting activities, requiring extensive knowledge of city layouts, the location of streets, fire hydrants and fire alarm boxes, and the principal buildings. A chief officer must be familiar with sources of fires, including explosives, hazardous chemicals, and the combustion qualities of materials in buildings, homes, and industrial plants.
In certain jurisdictions, civilians can get certified to be a Fire Warden, and some cities require certain types of buildings, such as high rises, to have a certain number of Fire Wardens. For example, the city of Houston in the United States requires every tenant in a high-rise to have at least one Fire Warden for every 7500 sq. ft. occupied, and a minimum of two Fire Wardens per floor. In this example, their duties include investigating any fire alarms (see if there really is a fire and if so, its nature), ensuring the fire department is contacted, directing the evacuation of the facility, activating or delaying activation of fire suppression equipment such as halon and sprinklers (delayed in case of a false alarm), meeting the fire department and taking them to the location of the alarm or to the fire past any security or locked doors, and, if necessary, fighting the fire until the fire department arrives.


=== Firefighter safety zone guidelines ===
The U.S. Forest Service publishes guidelines for the minimum distance a firefighter should be from a flame. As stated in the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's Incident Response Pocket Guide: ""A safety zone is an area where a firefighter can survive without a fire shelter"" and should be ""...at least four times the maximum continuous flame height."" However this figure only takes into account the effects of radiant heat and does not consider topography nor wind.
Safety Zones can be natural features such as rock screes, meadows, and river bars; or human-made features such a parking lots or areas that have been cleared of vegetation through mechanical means.


== Hazards caused by fires ==


=== During a fire ===

One of the major hazards associated with firefighting operations is the toxic environment created by combusting materials. The four major hazards are:

Smoke, which is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the increased variety and amount of synthetic household materials
Oxygen deficient atmosphere (21% O2 is normal and 19.5% O2 is considered oxygen deficient)
Elevated temperatures
Toxic atmospheres
To deal with such hazards, firefighters carry a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA; an open-circuit positive pressure system) to prevent smoke inhalation. These are not oxygen tanks (oxygen as a powerful fire accelerant would represent a grave risk when combined with virtually anything combustible in the presence of fire) but use compressed air in a similar manner to SCUBA diving gear. A firefighter's SCBA usually hold 30 to 45 minutes of air, depending on the size of the tank and the rate of consumption during strenuous activities. While this gear helps to eliminate the risks, firefighters are still exposed to smoke, toxic dust, fumes and radiation that have contributed to firefighters being 14% more likely to develop cancer.
Obvious risks associated with the immense heat generated by a fire, even without direct contact with the flames (direct flame impingement), such as conductive heat and radiant heat, can cause serious burns even from great distances. There are a number of comparably serious heat-related risks, such as burns from hot gases (e.g., air), steam, and hot and/or toxic smoke. Prolonged, intense exertion in hot environments also increases firefighters' risk for heat-related illnesses, such as rhabdomyolysis. Accordingly, firefighters are equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) that includes fire-resistant clothing such as Nomex or polybenzimidazole fiber (PBI) and helmets that limit the transmission of heat towards the body. No PPE, however, can completely protect the user from the effects of all possible fire conditions.
Heat can cause flammable liquid contained in tanks to explode violently, producing what is called a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion). Some chemical products such as ammonium nitrate fertilizers can also explode, potentially causing physical trauma from blast or shrapnel injuries. Sufficient heat causes human flesh to burn as fuel, or the water within to boil, leading to potentially severe medical problems.
Furthers risks include the occurrences of backdrafts. Backdrafts occur when there is a large amount of oxygen introduced to an oxygen-depleted fire.  If a fire is compartmentalized and most or all of the oxygen has been burned up, there is a high risk of backdraft if something such as a window or door is opened. Introducing oxygen to a low burning fire can be devastating as it will ignite all of the oxygen along the way. It can also be heard from miles away as it has a concussive blast that adds to the effect. Firefighters need to have extreme communication at all times on the fire ground as one broken window at the wrong time could seriously harm anyone operating on the building.
Depending on the heat of the fire, burns can occur in a fraction of a second.
Additional risks of fire are the obscuring of vision due to
smoke, potentially causing a fall or disorientation; becoming trapped in a fire; and structural collapse.
""Three hours of fighting a fire stiffens arteries and impairs cardiac function in firefighters"" according to a study by Bo Fernhall, a professor in the department of kinesiology and community health in the College of Applied Health Sciences, and Gavin Horn, director of research at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. The conditions (observed in healthy male firefighters) are ""also apparent found in weightlifters and endurance athletes...""


=== During debris cleanup ===

Once extinguished, fire debris cleanup poses several safety and health risks for workers.
Many hazardous substances are commonly found in fire debris. Silica can be found in concrete, roofing tiles, or it may be a naturally occurring element. Occupational exposures to silica dust can cause silicosis, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, airway diseases, and some additional non-respiratory diseases. Inhalation of asbestos can result in various diseases including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Sources of metals exposure include burnt or melted electronics, cars, refrigerators, stoves, etc. Fire debris cleanup workers may be exposed to these metals or their combustion products in the air or on their skin. These metals may include beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and many more. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are carcinogenic, come from the incomplete combustion of organic materials and are often found as a result of structural and wildland fires.
Safety hazards of fire cleanup include the risk of reignition of smoldering debris, electrocution from downed or exposed electrical lines or in instances where water has come into contact with electrical equipment. Structures that have been burned may be unstable and at risk of sudden collapse.
Standard personal protective equipment for fire cleanup include hard hats, goggles or safety glasses, heavy work gloves, earplugs or other hearing protection, steel-toe boots, and fall protection devices. Hazard controls for electrical injury include assuming all power lines are energized until confirmation they are de-energized, and grounding power lines to guard against electrical feedback, and using appropriate personal protective equipment. Proper respiratory protection can protect against hazardous substances. Proper ventilation of an area is an engineering control that can be used to avoid or minimize exposure to hazardous substances. When ventilation is insufficient or dust cannot be avoided, personal protective equipment such as N95 respirators can be used.


== Reconnaissance and ""reading"" the fire ==
 
The first step in a firefighting operation is reconnaissance to search for the origin of the fire (which may not be obvious for an indoor fire, especially if there are no witnesses), to identify any specific risks, and to detect possible casualties. An outdoor fire may not require reconnaissance, but a fire in a cellar or an underground car park with only a few centimeters of visibility may require long reconnaissance to identify the source of the fire.
The ""reading"" of a fire is the analysis by firefighters of indications of thermal events such as flashover, backdraft or smoke explosion. It is performed during reconnaissance and fire suppression maneuvers.
The main signs are:

Hot zones, which can be detected with a gloved hand, for example by touching a door before opening it;
Soot on windows, which usually means that combustion is incomplete, and thus, a lack of air in the room;
Smoke pulsing in and out around a door frame, as if the fire were breathing, which usually also means a lack of air to support combustion.
Spraying water on the ceiling in short pulses of a diffused spray (e.g., a cone with an opening angle of 60°) can be undertaken to test the heat of smoke: If the temperature is moderate, the water falls down in drops with a sound like rain; if the temperature is high, the water vaporizes with a hiss—the sign of a potentially extremely dangerous impending flashover.
Ideally, part of reconnaissance is consulting a plan for the building that provides information about structures, firefighter hazards, and in some cases the most appropriate strategies and tactics for fighting a fire in that context.


== Science of extinguishment ==

There are four elements needed to start and sustain a fire and/or flame: temperature, a fuel, an oxidizing agent (oxygen), and a chemical reaction. A fire can be extinguished by taking away any of the four components.
The fuel is the substance being oxidized or burned in the combustion process. The most common fuels contain carbon along with combinations of hydrogen and oxygen. Heat is the energy component of a fire. When it comes into contact with a fuel, it provides the energy necessary for ignition, causes the continuous production and ignition of fuel vapors or gases so that the combustion reaction can continue, and causes the vaporization of solid and liquid fuels. The resulting self-sustained chemical chain reaction is complex and requires fuel, an oxidizer, and heat energy to come together in a very specific way. An oxidizing agent is a material or substance that will release gases, including oxygen, when the proper conditions exist. It is crucial to the sustainment of a flame or fire.
Using water is one common method to extinguish a fire. Water extinguishes a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water’s ability to absorb massive amounts of heat as it converts to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. Water also extinguishes a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen in the air above the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam.
Another way to extinguish a fire is fuel removal. This can be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will self-extinguish.
One final extinguishing method is chemical flame inhibition. This can be accomplished by applying dry chemical or halogenated agents that interrupt the chemical chain reaction and stop flaming. This method is effective on gas and liquid fuel because they must have flame to burn.
Sound waves have been successfully used in a device fabricated by two George Mason University senior engineering students, Viet Tran and Seth Robertson, but the procedure is still awaiting a patent (2015).


== Use of water ==

One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water. The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at 1,000 °F (538 °C) it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by ""jumping"" to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of ""asphyxia"" (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area.
Water may be accessed from a pressurized fire hydrant, pumped from water sources such as lakes or rivers, delivered by tanker truck, or dropped from water bombers, which are aircraft adapted as tankers for fighting forest fires. An armored vehicle (firefighting tank) may be used where access to the area is difficult.


=== Open air fire ===
For outdoor fires, the seat of the fire is sprayed with a straight spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the ""asphyxia"" caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. This is because water droplets, upon forming in to water mist, increase their surface area by a large magnitude, greatly increasing the endothermic cooling effect and robbing the fire of oxygen. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the seat of the fire before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack.
An outdoor fire is always fed with air, and the risk to people is limited as they can move away from it, except in the case of wildfires or bushfires where they risk being easily surrounded by the flames. It might, however, be necessary to protect specific objects like houses or gas tanks against infrared radiation, and thus to use a diffused spray between the fire and the object. Breathing apparatus is often required as there is still the risk of inhaling smoke or poisonous gases.


=== Closed volume fire ===

Until the 1970s, fires were usually attacked while they declined, using the same strategy as for open air fires. Now fires are attacked in their development phase because firefighters arrive sooner at the site of a fire and because of changes in building construction. The increasing use of thermal insulation confines the heat, and modern materials, especially polymers, produce much more heat than do traditional materials like wood, plaster, stone, and bricks. Under these conditions, there is a greater risk of backdraft and flashover.
Directly spraying the seat of the fire in enclosed areas can have unfortunate consequences: the force of water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters.
When a fire spreads beyond the building of its origin and spreads throughout the neighborhood, it is called a “conflagration.” Today, a conflagration is a large fire that is beyond the capability of the fire service to contain.
The volume of the fire must be cooled before its seat is attacked. This strategy, originally of Swedish origin (Mats Rosander & Krister Giselsson), was adapted by London Fire Officer Paul Grimwood following a decade of operational use in the busy West End of London between 1984 and 1994 and termed the three-dimensional or 3D attack.
Use of a diffuse spray was first proposed by Chief Lloyd Layman of the Parkersburg Fire Department, at the 1950 Fire Department Instructors Conference (FDIC) held in Memphis. Using Grimwood's modified 3D attack strategy, the ceiling is first sprayed with short pulses of a diffuse spray. This 
cools the smoke which is then less likely to start a fire when it moves away. As gas cools it becomes denser (Charles's law); thus, it also reduces the mobility of the smoke and avoids a ""backfire"" of water vapor. Also, the diffuse spray creates an inert ""water vapor sky"", which prevents ""roll-over"" (rolls of flames on the ceiling created by hot burning gases).
Only short pulses of water need to be sprayed, otherwise the spraying modifies the equilibrium, and the gases mix instead of remaining stratified: the hot gases (initially at the ceiling) move around the room, and the temperature rises at the ground, which is dangerous for firefighters.
An alternative is to cool all the atmosphere by spraying the whole atmosphere as if drawing letters in the air (""penciling"").
Modern methods for extinguishing an urban fire dictate the use of a massive initial water flow, e.g. 500 L/min for each fire hose. The aim is to absorb as much heat as possible at the beginning to stop the expansion of the fire and to reduce the smoke. If the flow is too low, the cooling is insufficient, and the steam that is produced can burn firefighters (the drop of pressure is too small and the vapor is pushed back in their direction).
Although it may seem paradoxical, the use of a strong flow with an efficient fire hose and an efficient strategy (diffuse spray, small droplets) requires a smaller amount of water. This is because once the temperature is lowered, only a limited amount of water is necessary to suppress the fire seat with a straight spray. For a living room of 50 m2 (60 sq yd), the required amount of water is estimated as 60 L (15 gal).
French firefighters used an alternative method in the 1970s: spraying water on the hot walls to create a water vapor atmosphere and asphyxiate the fire. This method is no longer used because it turned out to be risky; the pressure created pushed the hot gases and vapor towards the firefighters, causing severe burns, and pushed the hot gases into other rooms where they could start other fires.


== Asphyxiating a fire ==

In some cases, the use of water is undesirable. This is because some chemical products react with water to produce poisonous gases, or they may even burn when they come into contact with water (e.g., sodium), see water-reactive substances. Another problem is that some products float on water, such as hydrocarbons (gasoline, oil, and alcohol, etc.); a burning layer can then be spread by the fire. If
a pressurized fuel tank is endangered by fire it is necessary to avoid heat shocks that may damage the tank if it is sprayed with cooling water; the resulting decompression might produce a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).
Electrical fires cannot be extinguished with water since the water could act as a conductor.
In such cases, it is necessary to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires and in the absence of other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there.


== Tactical ventilation or isolation of the fire ==
One of the main risks of a fire is the smoke; because, it carries heat and poisonous gases, and obscures vision. In the case of a fire in a closed location (building), the following two different strategies may be used: isolation of the fire or ventilation.
Paul Grimwood introduced the concept of tactical ventilation in the 1980s to encourage a better thought-out approach to this aspect of firefighting. Following work with Warrington Fire Research Consultants (FRDG 6/94) his terminology and concepts were adopted officially by the UK fire services, and are now referred to throughout revised Home Office training manuals (1996–97). Grimwood's original definition of his 1991 unified strategy stated that, ""tactical ventilation is either the venting, or containment (isolation) actions by on-scene firefighters, used to take control from the outset of a fire's burning regime, in an effort to gain tactical advantage during interior structural firefighting operations.""
When properly used, ventilation improves life safety, fire extinguishment, and property conservation by 'pulling' fire away from trapped occupants and objects.
In most cases of structural firefighting, windows are broken or removed from the outside of the building to provide efficient horizontal ventilation.  A 4x4 foot opening may also be cut into the roof directly over the fire room. This allows hot smoke and gases to escape through the opening, returning the conditions inside the room to normal. It is important to coordinate the ventilation with an interior fire attack since the opening of a ventilation hole supplies more air, and thus oxygen, to the fire. Ventilation may also ""limit fire spread by channeling fire toward nearby openings and allows fire fighters to safely attack the fire"" as well as limit smoke, heat, and water damage.
Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) consists of using a fan to create excess pressure in a part of the building. This pressure pushes the smoke and heat out of the building, and thus facilitates rescue and fire fighting operations. It is necessary to have an exit for the smoke, to know the building layout well to predict where the smoke will go, and to ensure that the doors ensuring the ventilation remain open by wedging or propping them. The main risk of this method is that it may accelerate the fire, or even create a f",1
Iroko,"Iroko (Yoruba: Ìrókò) is a large hardwood tree from the west coast of tropical Africa that can live up to 500 years. This is the common name for the genus Milicia, in which there are two recognized species, which are closely related: Milicia excelsa and Milicia regia.
The genus name of Milicia is in honour of Milici (19th and 20th centuries), an administrator in Portuguese East Africa (in modern-day Mozambique) who supported the work of the author of the genus, Thomas Robertson Sim. It was first described and published in Forest Fl. Port. E. Afr. on page 97 in 1909.
The tree is known to the Yoruba as ìrókò, logo or loko and is believed to have healing properties. Iroko is known to the Igbo people as ọjị wood. It is one of the woods sometimes referred to as African teak, although it is unrelated to the teak family. The wood colour is initially yellow but darkens to a richer copper brown over time.

== Species ==
Iroko is yielded mostly (probably) by Milicia excelsa. In much of the literature on this timber the names of the trees that yields it are given as Chlorophora excelsa (syn. Milicia excelsa) and Chlorophora regia (syn. Milicia regia).
Milicia excelsa is currently listed as 'near threatened' on the IUCN Red List.
Both species are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate individuals.


== Uses ==

The timber is used for a variety of external and internal purposes including boat-building, domestic flooring, furniture and outdoor gates.  From the late 1990s, it was used as part of the txalaparta, a Basque musical instrument constructed of wooden boards, due to its lively sound. Iroko is one of the traditional djembe woods.  Iroko wood was the wood chosen for the pews in the Our Lady of Peace Basilica.
It is a very durable wood; iroko does not require regular treatment with oil or varnish when used outdoors, although it is very difficult to work with tools as it tends to splinter easily, and blunts tools very quickly.
In the UK there are no trade restrictions on the machining of this timber. The only reported adverse effects known to be caused by the dust from iroko are asthma, dermatitis and nettle rash.


== Cultural beliefs ==
The tree is feared in some cultures where it originates and hence is shunned or revered with offerings. Yoruba people believe that the tree is inhabited by a spirit, and anybody who sees the Iroko-man face to face becomes insane and speedily dies. According to the Yoruba, any man who cuts down any iroko tree causes devastating misfortune on himself and all of his family, although if they need to cut down the tree they can make a prayer afterwards to protect themselves.
They also claim that the spirit of the Iroko can be heard in houses which use iroko wood, as the spirit of the Iroko is trapped in the wood. In Nigeria the iroko wood is of much lower quality due to soil conditions as well as root-rot. Some Westerners refer to the wood as ""poor man's teak"".

Software development,"Software development is the process of creating a computer software. It includes the software release life cycle of preparing a design, coding the program, and fixing the bugs. The final goal is software release of a product that serves the wishes of users.
Software product is usually a result of research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities.
There are 3 main goals of software development:

to meet specific needs of a specific client/business;
to meet a need of some set of potential users;
for personal use.


== Process ==
A software development process (model, methodology) is a system that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing information systems. Each model is defferent, more or less structured and is considered to be suitable to only some kinds of projects.
There are several stages of software development:

Analyzing the problem
Market research
Gathering requirements for the proposed software
Devising a plan or design for the software
Implementation (coding) of the software
Testing the software
Deployment
Maintenance and bug fixing


== Activities ==


=== Understanding the need ===
There are different sources of ideas for software products like market research. The next step is market evaluation. It includes a check of cost and time assumptions, economic feasibility, fit with existing channels distribution, effects on existing product lines, required features, fit with the company's marketing objectives.
This process is also connected with non-technical activities like human resources, risk management, intellectual property, budgeting, crisis management, etc.


=== Planning ===
An important task in creating a software program is understanding the requirements. The software engineers must accept the client's idea and adapt it to the working process.


=== Designing ===
After establishing the requirements, the engineers start creating a software design document. Design of the software means the high-level design of the main modules with a full picture of how the parts fit together. The language, operating system, and hardware components should be clear at this stage.


=== Implementation, testing and documenting ===
There are 3 next processes which are combined:

implementation — programming the code for the project.
testing — looking for defects
documenting — making documents of the inner design of software, API can be also included


=== Deployment and maintenance ===
The deployment includes installation, customization, testing, and possibly a longer period of evaluation.
Software training and support are important because software is only effective if it is used rightly.
Maintaining and improving software is the stage to cope with new faults or requirements, it usually takes a lot of time and effort.

K Foundation Burn a Million Quid,"K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was a work of performance art executed and filmed on 23 August 1994 in which the K Foundation, an art duo consisting of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, burned £1 million (equivalent to £2.5 million in 2023) in the back of a disused boathouse on the Ardfin Estate on the Scottish island of Jura. The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds that had been previously earned by Drummond and Cauty as the KLF.
The event was recorded on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. On the one year anniversary of the burning, 23 August 1995, the film was released as Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid and was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging audiences in debates about the burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning for a period of 23 years; Drummond subsequently made the decision to discreetly speak about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted that he regretted burning the money. The self-imposed moratorium officially ended on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning, when Cauty and Drummond hosted a debate asking ""Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?"" during their ""Welcome to the Dark Ages"" event.
Collaborator Chris Brook edited and compiled a book, K Foundation Burn A Million Quid, which was published by Ellipsis Books in 1997. It compiles stills from the film, accounts of events and viewer reactions, and an image of the brick that was manufactured from the fire's ashes. A film consisting of a static three-minute shot of the brick, ""This Brick"", was shown at London's Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K in the same year.


== Background ==
As The KLF, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991. They had also enjoyed considerable success with their album The White Room and a number one hit single – ""Doctorin' the Tardis"" – as The Timelords. In February 1992, The KLF staged an incendiary performance at the BRIT Awards, and retired from the music industry shortly thereafter in typically enigmatic fashion.

By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian Big Issue writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the royalties they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds: I think we made about £6m. We paid nearly half that in tax and spent the rest on production costs. When we stopped, the production costs stopped too, so over the next few months we amassed a surplus of cash still coming in from record sales; this amounted to about £1.8m. After tax we were left with about £1m. This was the money that later became the K Foundation fund for the 'advancement of kreation.'
Initially The KLF's earnings were to be distributed by way of a fund for struggling artists managed by the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty's new post-KLF art project, but, said Drummond, ""We realised that struggling artists are meant to struggle, that's the whole point."" Instead the duo decided to create art with the money. Nailed to the Wall was the first piece of art produced by the Foundation, and the major piece in their planned art exhibition, Money: A Major Body of Cash. Consisting of one million pounds in cash nailed to a pine frame, the piece was presented to the press on 23 November 1993 during the buildup to the Foundation's announcement of the ""winner"" of their ""worst artist of the year award"", the K Foundation art award.


== Decision and burning ==
During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. ""'The Tate, in Liverpool, wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from [...] the gallery curator informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly"", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. ""Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do."" Cauty: ""We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare.""
The journey from deciding to burn the money to deciding how to burn the money to actually burning the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering Nailed to the Wall to the Tate Gallery as the ""1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation."" The condition was that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, the money would be burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside Power Station, ""the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the South Bank"", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF 'guerrilla communication' style, ""posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation', under which would have been an image of Nailed to the Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt.""

The K Foundation's ultimate resolution for their one-million-pound ""problem"" was rather less showbiz, but dramatic nonetheless, the Foundation having decided that making a public spectacle of the event would lessen its impact. On 22 August, Reid, Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo touched down at Islay Airport in the Inner Hebrides and took a ferry to the island of Jura, previously the scene of a wicker man burning ceremony by The KLF. Early in the morning of 23 August 1994, in an abandoned boathouse on Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated the money. The burning was witnessed by Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the act for The Observer, and it was filmed on a Hi-8 video camera by collaborator Gimpo. As the burning began Reid said he felt guilt and shock. These feelings, he reported, quickly turned to boredom.
The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. According to Drummond, only about £900,000 of the money was actually burnt, with the remainder flying straight up the chimney. Two days later, according to Reid, Jimmy Cauty destroyed all film and photographic evidence of the burning. Ten months later, Gimpo revealed to them that he had secretly kept a copy.


== Film ==
Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid starts with a short description of the event, and then consists of Drummond and Cauty throwing £50 notes onto the fire. Burning the entire amount takes around 67 minutes. NME wrote: At the start, Cauty is agitated and says he doesn't think the money will burn because it is too wet. The camera shows 20 thick bundles of £50 notes, each bundle containing £50,000 in new bank notes and sealed in cellophane. When the money ignites, Drummond starts to laugh as he and Cauty stand above a small fireplace throwing £50 notes on to the fire. Cauty constantly stokes the blaze with a large wooden plank and at one stage burns his hand on a flaming note. As the fire starts to dim, he scuttles around the floor sweeping stray notes into the flames. The cameraman shows a view from outside the building with charred £50 notes billowing out of the chimney.
In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the Omnibus documentary series about The K Foundation entitled A Foundation Course in Art (usually mislabelled as The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid online). Amongst the footage broadcast were scenes from Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. Thomas Sutcliffe, reviewing the programme in The Independent, wrote:The Omnibus film about this intriguing pair was in part a rear-guard action in their continuing battle for recognition (and a victory – for some people, after all, art is what appears on Omnibus). It was also a peculiarly modern fable about what constitutes an artist – will the artist's say-so do, or do you need the validation of the galleries? ""You can't simply decide you're going to become an artist,"" said one gallery owner haughtily, which left you wondering how else the vocation might operate. A lottery system? Secret-ballot election?
For my money (meagre though it is), the video which recorded the laborious process of immolation was a decidedly intriguing work – rather more provoking than some contemporary work I've seen. For established galleries, the medium used (video, bank-notes, fire) is obviously an embarrassment, but if poverty of material is not to disqualify artworks (bricks or lard, say) why should the expense of material?


=== Screening tour ===
The first public screening of Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was on Jura on 23 August 1995 – exactly one year after the burning. ""We feel we should face them and answer their questions"" said one of the duo. Two weeks later an advert appeared in The Guardian, announcing a world tour of the film over the next 12 months at ""relevant locations"". The second screening was at In the City music industry convention on 5 September in Manchester. After the film was shown, Drummond and Cauty held a question-and-answer session with the theme ""Is It Rock'n'Roll?"". A week later, the pair travelled as guests of alternative radio station B92 to Belgrade, where the post-screening discussion was titled ""Is it a crime against humanity?"" An unauthorised screening at the BBC Television Centre was curtailed and Drummond and Cauty were escorted from the building.
On the weekend of 3 November 1995, the film was screened at several locations in Glasgow, including at football matches involving Celtic and Rangers; a planned screening at Barlinnie prison was cancelled after the Scottish Prison Service withdrew permission. Glasgow's artistic community broadly seemed to welcome the screenings. A further public screening on Glasgow Green on 5 November was announced by various newspapers, but there is no record of the showing having ever occurred. The K Foundation disappeared from Glasgow; they later issued a statement that on 5 November 1995 they had signed a ""contract"" on the side of a Nissan Bluebird - which had then been pushed over the cliffs at Cape Wrath in northern Scotland - agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years.
Despite the K Foundation's reported moratorium, further national screenings of the film organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening, Drummond and Cauty announced they would not answer questions after the film; instead, they would ask questions of the audience. These screenings were held in Bradford, Hull, Liverpool, Jamaica Street Studios, Cheltenham Ladies College, Eton College, Aberystwyth, Glastonbury Tor, Alan Moore's front room and Brick Lane, London.
The Brick Lane screening – on 8 December 1995 – had been previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned for a car park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to the basement of the nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.


== End of the moratorium ==
Drummond and Cauty ended their self-imposed moratorium on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning. ""Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?"" was debated during ""Welcome to the Dark Ages"", a three-day festival celebrating the launch of their novel 2023: A Trilogy.


== Burning as a theme ==

Ritualistic burnings had already been a recurring aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut album—The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)—by burning them in a Swedish field. This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and celebrated in the song ""Burn the Bastards"". During the 1991 summer solstice, they burnt a 60 feet (18 m) wicker man on Jura, as chronicled in the KLF movie The Rites of Mu.
As the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty threatened to burn the K Foundation art award prize money (Gimpo was fumbling with matches and lighter fluid when, at the last moment, Rachel Whiteread accepted the prize). In the seventh K Foundation press advert they asked ""What would you do with a million pounds? Burn it?""


== Reaction and analysis ==
Jim Reid's piece appeared in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is ""one of the most peculiar stories of the year"", he cautioned readers. ""Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going to have trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth."" ""It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames"", he added. ""I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this.""
The Daily Express ran the story on 1 October 1994. They reported that charred £50 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had really taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.
The Times followed with essentially the same story on 4 October 1994, adding that the burning ""[had] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and angry"". £1,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to Islay police: ""Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with Customs and Excise, who pronounced it genuine. 'I telephoned Mr Drummond in London and told him the money had been found. I asked him if it was his. He said he would get in touch with his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not telephoned back'"".
The media returned to the story in earnest in October and November 1995, previewing and then reviewing Foundation Course in Art, and reporting on the K Foundation's tour screening Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid.
An October 1995 feature quoted Kevin Hull, the BBC documentary maker responsible for the Omnibus item, saying he had found ""the boys rather depressed, and almost in a state of shock"". ""Every day I wake up and I think 'Oh God, I've burnt a million quid and everyone thinks it's wrong'"", Cauty told him.
A piece in The Times on 5 November 1995, coinciding with the Glasgow screenings, reported that the K Foundation had no solid reason for burning the money or view of what, if anything, the act represented, but concluded ""The K Foundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly provoked thousands to question and analyse the power of money and the responsibilities of those who possess it. And what could be more artistic than that?"" In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all ""entertaining, and satirically quite sharp"", but ""the art world has chosen not to think [of it as art].... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original. Although they didn't blow their entire life's savings along the way, other artists, notably Yves Klein and Chris Burden, have been here before.""
The Guardian's TV reviewer was sceptical. ""Snag is, the K men have always dealt in myth and sown a trail of confusion, so nobody quite believes they really burned the money. And if they did, they must be nuts.""


=== Later reaction ===
In the following years, the burning was mentioned regularly in the press, with Drummond and Cauty often relegated to a cultural status of ""the men who burnt a million quid"".
A February 2000 article in The Observer newspaper again insisted that the duo really had burnt one million pounds. ""It wasn't a stunt. They really did it. If you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. 'I knew it was real,' a long-time friend and associate of his group The KLF tells me, 'because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be honest, they've never really been the same since'"".
A 2004 listener poll by BBC Radio 6 Music saw The KLF/K Foundation placed second after The Who in a list of ""rock excesses"".
Drummond's former protégé Julian Cope was unimpressed, claiming that Drummond still owed him money. ""He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry-wank stunts like that.""


== Legacy ==
On 17 September 1997, a new film, This Brick, was premiered. The film consisted of one three-minute shot of a brick made from the ashes of the money burnt at Jura. It was shown at the Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K.
On 27 September 1997, K Foundation Burn A Million Quid (ISBN 0-9541656-5-9, ISBN 1-899858-37-7 paperback) was published. The book, by Chris Brook and Gimpo, contains stills from the film and transcriptions of various Q&A sessions from the tour. It also includes a timeline of K Foundation activity and sundry essays including one from Alan Moore. Publisher Ellipsis promoted the book with an advert modelled on those of the K Foundation – ""Why did Ellipsis publish K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?"" they asked.
Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling The Observer in 2000 that he couldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless his child was ill and only ""an expensive clinic"" could cure him. By 2004, however, he had admitted to the BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. ""It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand.""

Compiler,"A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. The first language is called the source language, and the code is called source code. The second language is called the target and can usually be understood by computers. In that case, the instructions become machine code.
If a compiler can convert the same instruction text into machine code for different computers (like smartphones or video game machines), it is a 'cross-compiler'. If the compiler can make instruction text that is easier for people to read, it is a 'de-compiler'. People who write these instructions are called programmers. Some even made programs that can translate the instructions that describe how a compiler should work, into a compiler. That kind of program is called a compiler-compiler.
A compiler usually has three steps. It reads the text and makes notes about how the instructions go together. If the instructions don't make sense, it will try to tell the programmer. Then it will use what it knows about the target language to make the instructions fit better. It then writes down the instructions in the target language. If the source instructions are on different pages, it may have to compile several before it can write everything down.


== Compiling the language ==
A compiler has six parts :
The first piece, a lexical analyzer, reads a page of instruction text and splits it into words and sentences. It also marks the type for each word. For example, a word may be number, a variable, a verb, a math sign, or an adjective. The output of a lexical analyzer is a list of tokens.
int x = 5 + y;
(type, int) (unknown word, x) (math sign, =) (number, 5) (math sign, +) (word already seen, y)
A parser reads in the output of the lexical analyzer, and verifies the syntax of the language. If the input program is syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates errors and warnings. This is called semantic analysis. For example, the parser might complain about the example above, if it had not already seen y with its type adjective. The parser uses all the information to make a structure typically called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

The next piece, an optimizer rearranges the tree structure so the target language is optimized. 'Optimized' includes using fewer instructions to perform the same work. This could be important if the final program needs to check a lot of data. (Like seeing how many people, in the whole country, are fifty years old and buy medicine.) An 'optimized' result might also mean breaking long instructions into smaller ones. Unused and unaccessible code will be removed at this step.
A programmer usually tries to write instructions in small, related groups. That way, they can keep track of fewer changes in the program. But, that means the code may go on several pages. When a compiler sees that the target program uses several pages to explain the whole recipe, it may use a linker. The linker will put instructions that say where to find the code that's next. Finally, the compiler writes down the instructions in the target language.

Programmers who write compiler code try to make it as perfect as possible. If the programmer writes incorrect code, the compiler informs of them an error, but if the compiler code itself contains errors, it may be hard to tell where exactly the problem lies.


== Variants ==
At the end of each compilation step the partial finished product could be stored and then only processed later on. A language like Java uses this successfully, where they lack the final translation step to instructions the processor understands. They only do the final translation step once the Java program is running on a computer. This is either called ""interpreting"" or ""JIT""ting, depending on the technique used.


== Example ==
For example, the source code might contain an equation, such as ""x = 5*10 + 6 + 1"". The lexical analyzer would separate each number and symbol (such as ""*"" or ""+"") into separate tokens. The parser would note the pattern of tokens, as being an equation. The intermediate-code generator would write a form of coding which defines a storage variable named ""x"" and assigns the numerical product of 5*10 plus 6 and 1. The optimizer would simplify the calculation, of 5*10+6+1, as being just 57. Hence, the target machine-code generator would set a variable named ""x"" and put the value 57 into that storage place in the computer's memory, using the instructions of whichever computer chip is being used.

Light curve,"In astronomy, a light curve is a graph that shows the brightness of light from a celestial object or region, over a certain amount of time.  
The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or band. Light curves can be periodic, that is they repeat in a regular pattern. Examples are eclipsing binaries and cepheid variables. Light curves can also be aperiodic, that is they are irregular with no pattern. Examples include the light curve of a nova, a cataclysmic variable star, a supernova or other event. The study of the light curve, together with other observations, gives information about the physical process that produces it or constrains the physical theories about it.


== Planetology ==
In the study of planets (planetology), a light curve can be used to work out the rotation period of a minor planet, moon, or comet nucleus. From the Earth many objects are so small that even the most powerful telescopes are unable to see objects clearly. Because of this astronomers measure the amount of light produced by the object over a period of time, its light curve. 
The time between the peaks on the graph gives the rotational period of the object. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, the amplitude of the light curve, can be caused by either the shape of the object, or bright and dark areas on the surface. For example, an odd shaped asteroid's light curve generally has more pronounced peaks, while a more spherical object's light curve will be flatter. When the light curve covers a long period of time, it is called a secular light curve.


== Botany ==
In botany, a light curve shows the photosynthetic response of a leaf or algae to the brightness of a light. 
In low light, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the amount of chlorophyll and the efficiency of the light-dependent reactions. In higher light levels it is limited by the efficiency of RuBisCO (an enzyme) and the amount of carbon dioxide. 
The point on the graph where these two differing lines meet is called the light saturation point. This is where the light-dependent reactions are making more ATP and NADPH than can be used by the light-independent reactions.  Since photosynthesis is also limited by ambient carbon dioxide levels, light curves are often repeated at several different constant carbon dioxide concentrations.

Tomb effigy,"A tomb effigy (French: gisant (""lying"")) is a sculpted effigy of a deceased person usually shown lying recumbent on a rectangular slab, presented in full ceremonial dress or wrapped in a shroud, and shown either dying or shortly after death. Such funerary and commemorative reliefs were first developed in Ancient Egyptian and Etruscan cultures, and appear most frequently in Western European tombs from the late 11th century, in a style that continued in use through the Renaissance and early modern period, and is still sometimes used. They typically represent the deceased in a state of ""eternal repose"", with hands folded in prayer, lying on a pillow, awaiting resurrection. A husband and wife may be depicted lying side by side.
Medieval life-size recumbent effigies were first used for tombs of royalty and senior clerics, before spreading to the nobility. A particular type of late medieval effigy was the transi, or cadaver monument, in which the effigy is in the macabre form of a decomposing corpse, or such a figure lies on a lower level, beneath a more conventional effigy. Mourning or weeping figures, known as pleurants were added to important tombs below the effigy. Non-recumbent types of effigy became popular during the Renaissance. By the early Modern period, European effigies were often shown as alive, either kneeling or in a more active pose, especially for military figures. Variations show the deceased lying on their side as if reading, kneeling in prayer, or even standing. The recumbent effigy had something of a revival during the 19th-century Gothic revival, especially for bishops and other clerics.
Some of the best-known examples of the form are in Westminster Abbey in London, St Peter’s Basilica in Rome, Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice (twenty-five Doges), and the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence.


== Antiquity ==


=== Egyptian ===

The religious beliefs of the societies that produced the earliest Egyptian effigies  (which date to c. 2700–2200 BC, during the Old Kingdom) are unknown but are usually assumed by modern archeologists to have commemorated either fallen Gods or members of royalty. Their meaning can only be guessed at: modern archeologists see them as depictions intended to house the souls of the dead, intended to identify them as they travel through the realm of the dead. The earliest known tomb effigy is that of Djoser (c. 2686–2613 BC), found in the worship chamber of the Pyramid of Djoser. The effigies were typically smaller than life-size.
Funerary masks were used throughout the Egyptian periods. Examples range from the gold masks of Tutankhamun and Psusennes I to the Roman ""mummy portraits"" from Hawara and the Fayum. Whether in a funerary or religious context, the purpose of a mask was the same: to transform the wearer from a mortal to a divine state. The Romans continued this tradition of idolatry, and also created many other types of effigies. The faces are often clearly portraits of individuals.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Classical ===

Recumbent effigies were a common tradition in the funerary art of the Etruscans, an advanced civilisation and culture that developed in central Italy before 700 BC and flourished until the late second century BC. Their effigies were typically carved in high relief, and produced in a variety of materials, including ceramic, terracotta, marble, limestone and alabaster. Structurally, they fall into two categories: small squarish cinerary urns for cremation and near life-sized rectangular sarcophagi for burials, with cremation becoming more popular over the centuries. Etruscan culture viewed the dead as no less complete than the living and existing in a realm where they were forever either in despair or enjoying material comfort. From 500 BC, the effigies show the deceased as they looked while alive. They are often lavishly dressed and enjoying food and drink as if at a feast. They are typically reclining (as if alive) rather than recumbent (as if dead), with open eyes turned towards the viewer, and are often propped up on a pillow while leaning on their arm or elbow.
By the 7th century the Etruscans were depicting human heads on canopic urns. When they started to bury their dead in the late 6th century they used terracotta sarcophagi, with an image of the deceased reclining on the lid alone or with a spouse. The Etruscan style influenced late Ancient Greek, especially in the manner of showing the dead as they had been in life, typically in the stele (stone or wooden slabs usually built as funerary markers) format. Any aspects of the style were adapted by the Romans, and eventually spread as far as Western Asia.
Pre-historic Romans of Palatine Hill often cremated their dead (usually on pyres), while those of the Quirinal Hill would entomb the body. Eventually, the two practices merged, wherein the actual body was entombed, and an effigy of the deceased was burned. The Romans adopted the Etruscan tomb formats, maintaining the practice of showing the deceased as they were while alive. Roman sarcophagi were built from marble, and over time took on a more a contemplative, spiritual and redemptive iconographical tone, emphasising the deceased's former hierarchical role in society.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Medieval ==


=== Origin and characteristics ===

The spread of Christianity throughout Europe introduced new attitudes towards death and the dead, and for the first time tombs were built in places of worship, that is churches. The first medieval recumbent effigies (gisants) were produced in the 11th century, with the earliest surviving example being that of Rudolf of Rheinfelden (d. 1080) in Merseburg Cathedral in Germany. These early effigies show the deceased (usually a royal, senior cleric or aristocrat) dressed in contemporary clothing. The format proliferated across Northern Europe in the late 12th century as it became popular amongst a growing class of wealthy elites who often commissioned their tombs years before their death; often seeking to cement their historical or spiritual legacy or —especially in early examples— restore a reputation tarnished by political or military defeat.
The art historian Marisa Anne Bass summed up the function of medieval effigies by writing that ""to represent death is to make present an absence."" Historians differ as to the historical influences behind their designs. Writing in 1964, in the first major general survey of tomb sculptures, the art historian Erwin Panofsky suggested that they were based on mosaic from North African and Spanish tombs, with other art historians arguing that the primary influence was from Classical funerary monuments, particularly those from Etruscan culture. The historian Shirin Fozi recognises the influence of earlier formats, but thought that the idea of placing an ""enlivened"" representation of the dead above their grave is ""too intuitive and too obvious to be read that ancient analogues were necessarily sources of inspiration."" According to the English historian Alfred C. Fryer, a ""hastily made and lively effigy"" of the deceased ""in his very robes of estate"" became part of the funeral procession, after which the representation was left either above or near the burial spot. They were placed on many types of tombs; at first on tomb slabs before table or chest tombs (tumba) became the standard. Later, tombs built into cavities in walls became popular in France and Spain.
The Early Medieval effigies are typically made from limestone, sandstone, marble or more rarely bronze or wood (usually oak). Alabaster became popular from the early 14th century, and by 1500 in England was the most popular the core material. Bronze remained in use, however due to its intrinsic value such tombs were often dismaltled and the material sold on; today only English examples survive.
The early ""chest tombs"" were typically built from several stone panels, with a cavity (often filled with rubble) to support the effigy. They were designed to give the impression that the body had been placed within it, but the corpse was usually buried in a vault below or beside the monument. Recent excavations indicate that some 14th-century chests acted as containers for the body. However, relatively few medieval tomb monuments have been opened. Notable examples where the body was placed inside the chest include the tombs of Henry III of England (completed c. 1290) and Edward I (d. 1307), both in Westminster Abbey, London. When the latter tomb was opened in 1774, the remains were found in a marble coffin placed on a bed of rubble.


=== Romanesque (France) ===

The earliest medieval examples are German; the style was significantly developed by French sculptors during the Romanesque style between c. 1080 and c. 1160. By the 12th century, German, Dutch, Belgian, Spanish effigies largely followed the forms and iconography of the French models and had begun to adapt elements of the emerging Gothic style.
Romanesque effigies were typically carved from white marble or alabaster, and depict the deceased's body and face as they appeared in life, with no marks of illness or death. The faces are idealised rather than accurate portrayals and often show the deceased much younger than they had been at death. The effigies are always recumbent—as if dead, and by the 14th century with hands clasped in prayer. The most common material is carvings on marble, alabaster or wood, with some examples cast in bronze or brass. The faces and hands of the few surviving wooden effigies are made from wax or plaster. The effigies were usually polychromed to simulate life, but in most cases, the paint has long since worn away.
The first secular examples appeared in the 12th century following the establishment of the knightly class. These tombs were usually placed on flat marble slabs supported by tomb-style chests (also known as tumba) decorated with heraldry and architectural detailing. The earliest examples showing armour date from the 1240s, with the most numerous surviving examples in England. The two most common poses from these English types are knights pulling out their sword or lying cross-legged; particularly English motifs although there are some Polish and French examples.
While the Romanesque and Gothic tombs were produced in great numbers —especially in France and England— it is estimated that over half were destroyed during the iconoclasm in the early modern period, and more again during the French Revolution. The majority of English churches were not subject to such destruction.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Britain ===

The larger-scale production of effigies began in Britain in the middle of the 13th century, following the emergence of the knightly class. Tombs effigies are the most numerous type of surviving medieval statuary in Britain, with around 250 extant secular effigies from each of the 13th and 14th centuries alone. The most numerous early examples are representations of knights, with over 150 such effigies surviving from the 13th century and almost 200 from the 14th century. They are typically below life-sized and often show the deceased with sword drawn or their legs crossed. Many of those of knights produced during the Plantagenet reign are known as ""dying Gauls"", given they show the deceased reaching for their sword as if they are either about to commence battle or are struggling against death. 
The 13th-century knightly effigies are less rigid and statuesque than French examples, reflecting what the historian H. A. Tummers describes as a ""more worldly and less spiritual outlook"". Those in the Temple Church, London are among some of the earliest examples and include the effigy of Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex (d. 1144) and that of the Anglo-Norman statesman William Marshal (d. 1219), a benefactor of the Knights Templar who served Henry II.
The drawing of the sword is intended to show, according to the art historian Rachel Dressler, their ""physical dynamism"". The cross-legged pose is more difficult to interpret. It was long thought to indicate that the deceased had participated in the Crusades or had been a Knight Templar, but these theories now rejected by scholars. 
Britain's periods of iconoclasm were not as severe or extensive as those in northern continental Europe, and so the surviving number of examples exceeds even that of France. However a great number were destroyed during iconoclasm waves from the 14th century and the Cromwellian Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 17th century. The main period of destruction was in the 16th century, during the Reformation led by Henry VIII, when many monastic settlements were destroyed, with casualties including many English royal tombs. 
Due to the relative scarcity of appropriate stone material —especially in London and the surrounding counties— wooden effigies became common during the Romanesque period. Given wood's perishability, only five examples survive, all in oak.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Burgundy ===

The Dukes of Burgundy, who ruled in present-day Belgium, Luxembourg and northern France during the 14th and 15th centuries, were recognised throughout Europe as patrons of the arts. Through their cultivation of artists such as the sculptor Claus Sluter and the painters Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden (who is thought to have painted some of their effigies), they became key in the development of Early Netherlandish art and the wider Northern Renaissance.
The iconography of Burgundian tombs develops forms and motifs found on monuments for French Kings in the Basilica of Saint-Denis, near Paris. The now lost tomb of Joan of Brabant (c. 1457) is probably the earliest example; its rows of mourners positioned below the slab were reproduced in later Burgundian tombs, including those of Isabella of Bourbon, constructed between 1475 and 1476, where the mourners were directly copied from Joan's monument.
The style became influential across Europe with the tomb of Philip the Bold (d. 1404), built over 30 years from 1381 by the sculptors Jean de Marville (d. 1389) and Sluter (d. 1405?) for the Chartreuse de Champmol, near  Dijon, which also houses the tombs of his son John the Fearless (d. 1419) and John's wife Margaret of Bavaria (d. 1424). Philip's tomb is described by the art historian Frits Scholten as ""one of the most magnificent tombs of the Late Middle Ages"".

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

The Burgundian effigies are characterised by naturalistic faces, open eyes, angels above their heads, and animals (either dogs or lions) at their feet. Philip's is made from polychromed white marble which gives a natural pallor. His head rests on a cushion, and he has an angel on each side to watch over him, presumably guiding him into the afterlife. The open eyes are intended as an affirmation of the Resurrection, as are the prayers contained in the books held by some of the mourners in the niches.


=== Eastern Europe ===
Several 16th-century Polish tombs contained cross-legged effigies. However, the iconography is believed to differ from English examples, and rather than denoting a knight killed on the battlefield, the pose instead probably symbolizes either the princely status of the deceased or according to the historian Jan Białostocki, ""their state of quiet and blessed repose"".


== Renaissance ==
While many of the innovations in medieval tomb effigies occurred in Northern Europe, the influence of Renaissance sculpture is evident in Italy from the early 15th century and later in Spain. While the structure of the tomb monuments stayed largely faithful to the earlier Romanesque and Gothic traditions, the iconography began to reflect the societal shift in attitude towards the dead. This is seen particularly in the incorporation of secular and humanistic imagery, as earlier the religious imperatives behind tomb design, desire to licit intercessory prayer from the viewers to quicken the passage of the soul through purgatory.
The architectural settings became more elaborate, incorporating Classical elements such as putto,  sirens, centaurs and Roman-style profile heads. The tombs and their effigies incorporated and merged recent sculptural and painterly innovations with classical traditions.
Most significantly, non-recumbent effigies became more popular, with variations including the deceased lying upwards on their side, kneeling in prayer, or even standing. The upper portion of the Tomb of Valentina Balbiani (d. 1572) shows her in life, with a book and dog, reclining in a restful pose reminiscent of Etruscan effigies. A bas-relief on the tomb's base shows her decomposed corpse in the transi style.
A number of old masters were involved in their design and construction including Donatello and Bernini

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Modern ==


=== Post-French revolution ===

European tomb monuments adapted innovations from other forms of sculpture during the early modern period, including from non-European influence. However, in part driven by Enlightenment attitudes towards religion, the human body and the possibility of an afterlife, by the 1750s effigies had largely fallen out of use across Europe. Although the format remained popular in England, it became especially rare in France in the wake of the Revolution: in 1793 the leaders of the French First Republic decreed the destruction of the ""tombs and mausoleums of the former kings"" (which were mostly at the Basilica of Saint-Denis) to celebrate the first anniversary of the fall of the monarchy and the collapse of the Ancien régime system.

Individual burial in large cities was discouraged in mainland Europe, in part due to a lack of available space but also due to hygiene concerns. They were replaced by unmarked collective ossuaries such as the Paris catacombs where the dead were interred without Christian rites.
This change followed the general loss in religious belief following the revolution; Panofsky referred to European tombs after the 17th century as a ""sceptical affair"", while other art historians, including Fred Licht, noted a prevaling indifference towards funerary rites.


=== 19th-century ===
Recumbent effigies returned to vogue during the early 19th century when a series of major new cemeteries were founded, usually just outside the city bounds, the largest being Montmartre in Paris and Monument Cemetery in Milan. In France, cemeteries began to be seen as secular places where all –regardless of class– could visit their dead, and were managed by local government rather than the church. Thus effigies became commemorative rather than funerary and lost most of their religious associations. The change coincided with the transition between what the art historian Suzanne Glover Lindsay describes as the 'dramatic' baroque style to the 'cold' neoclassicism"" styles. According to the Lindsay, individual French examples came to be regarded as ""among the highest representations of modern...sculpture"" and helped increase the reputations of many individual sculptors in a period when the craft had significantly less prestige than painting or architecture.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Material ==
The vast majority of medieval effigies were made from stone, usually either marble or alabaster. Wooden effigies became popular in southern England, and there are examples of copper-alloy tombs, especially in France and the former Burgundy lands.


== Types ==


=== Double tombs ===

The practice of showing the effigies of a married couple side by side on the same plinth (or slab) began in France and Germany in the late 13th century and spread across northern Europe in the late 14th century. They can be categorised into two basic types: those where the effigies were created separately (at different dates of death) and later placed together on a single plinth, and those created at the same time from a single block of stone. In the former type, the tomb would often have been commissioned and built before the death of the remaining spouse. The practice may have begun as a device for legitimising controversial or contested royal marriages. In the same way, early Gothic double-tombs were not necessarily intended to celebrate the love between the couple, but to both reinforce the political aspect of their union.
Many late 14th- and early 15th-century examples show the couples holding hands. While the motif was undoubtedly used to reflect the affection between the couple, it also needs to be seen in contemporaneity ritual and legal context. Writing in 2021, the art historian Jessica Barker said that the gesture should be seen as analogous to a modern handshake that ""both symbolised and effected an agreement between two parties."" An early example is the now-lost tomb for Blanche of Lancaster (d. 1368) and her second husband John of Gaunt (d. 1399). The two most celebrated medieval examples are those of Richard II of England (d. 1400) and Anne of Bohemia (d. 1394), and John I of Portugal (d. 1433) and Philippa of Lancaster (d. 1415), which Barker describes as ""placing extraordinary emphasis on the love between the king and queen"". The well known Philip Larkin poem An Arundel Tomb, completed in 1964, describes and reflects on the effigies for Richard Fitzalan (d. 1376) and Eleanor of Lancaster (d. 1372) in Chichester Cathedral.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Cadaver monuments ===

The practice of showing the deceased as a decomposing corpse began in France in the late 14th century and soon spread across Northern Europe. Known as cadaver monuments (French: Transi), these effigies show the deceased as an emaciated corpse, usually with closed eyes, wearing a shroud or naked (but with their hands arranged to preserve modesty). The format is in stark contrast to gisants, which are always in full dress, with open eyes and often with hands clasped and raised in prayer. The best-known examples were produced by members of the first rank of contemporary sculptors, including Conrad Meit (d. c. 1550). A variation known as demigisant or gisant accounde (""lying on his shoulder"") shows the figure lying on its side, held up by its elbows in the Etruscan style while awaiting death, while the mourant assiste type shows the deceased alive but alone, lying on their back.
Cadaver monuments first appeared in the 1380s and remained popular for 200 years. Usually intended  as a form of memento mori, they show the human body's transition from life to decomposition, highlighting the contrast between worldly riches and elegance and the degradation of death. A c. 1435–1440 illuminated miniature of a Lady in a Tomb from ""The Dawnce of Makabre"" folios in the Additional manuscript 37049 (now in the British Library) shows the tiered (double or ""two-body"") tomb of a fashionable English lady, with her shown in life above the slab, and as a decayed corpse within the tomb chest. The verse below the illustration reads: ""Take hede un to my fygure here abowne, And se how sumtyme I was fresche and gay, Now turned to wormes mete and corrupcoun, Bot fowle erthe and stynkyng slyme and clay"". However, the art historian Kathleen Cohen notes some important differences to memento mori, primarily that Transi represent specific deceased individuals, and not death itself.

Cadaver monuments were a dramatic change from the typical practice of depicting the deceased either in life or in a more idealised form. The impulse toward graphic expression of mortality in part reflects the societal shock and trauma following the Black Death, which hit Europe in 1346 and killed up to half of the population of Eurasia in the next four years. Its aftermath saw, in 15th- and 16th-century literature, painting, manuscript illustration and sculpture, a pronounced emphasis on the macabre and memento mori, indicating a pre-occupation with the brevity and fragility of human life.
In her (incomplete but representative) 1973 survey of extant cadaver monuments, Cohen lists 200 examples, of which 82 are English (produced between 1424–1689), 61 are French (produced 1391–1613), 36 are German (1456–1594), and 20 are in the Lowlands (1387–1645). Considerable differences in style developed across regions and time. The early examples show the deceased either covered in a shroud (popular in France, Burgundy and England), as a shrivelled corpse with tightly pulled skin (especially popular in England), or a decomposing body covered by frogs and snakes (Germany and Austria). The practice of showing the body crawling with worms became popular in France.
Over the centuries, the depictions became more realistic and gruesome, while the early tendency to line the tombs with moralising inscriptions on the vanities of life was abandoned. The convention reached a peak in the late 16th century, with the more extreme effigies depicting putrefied corpses outside of the funerary monument context, and taking centre stage as stand-alone sculptures.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Historiography ==
Art-historical studies of tomb sculpture and sepulchral iconography tend to focus on case studies of single examples or regional groups rather than on a broad overview of the type's origins, development and sociological contexts. The main hindrance is the wide interdisciplinary nature required when writing broadly about the area. As Barker points out, comprehensive and authoritative knowledge of such a large topic would necessitate ""trespass[ing] on the preserves of archaeology, Egyptology, theology, the history of religion and superstition, philology, and many other [disciplines]"". A further practical difficulty is that the many surviving examples are dispersed in churches, abbeys and cathedrals across a large temporal and geographical span, making comprehensive field research especially difficult.
In 1954, Henriette s' Jacob published ""Idealism and Realism: A Study of Sepulchral Symbolism"", which focused on the various iconographical aspects of tomb imagery. This was followed in 1964 by Panofsky's influential monograph Tomb Sculpture: Its Changing Aspects from Ancient Egypt to Bernini which was based on four lectures he had given and was the broadest and most comprehensive survey to date of European funerary art. Panofsky acknowledged the challenge of scope in his introduction, admitting his reserve on impinging on the ""preserves of many adjacent disciplines"" in which he is not expert. Although broader than any earlier publications on the topic, the lectures often stray into descriptions of specific works and its scope ends in the 17th century. In a very positive contemporary review, the art historian Jan Białostocki praises Panofsky's lectures as a breakthrough but clarifies that its ""treatment of the subject is synthetic and that only the most general outlines of tomb sculpture's development, both in the field of iconography and style, are given."" The art historian Susie Nash noted in her 2016 article ""Fifty Years Since Panofsky’s 'Tomb Sculpture'"" that the topic was at the time so understudied that the reader can discern Panofsky ""attempting to codify funerary imagery by formulating its terminology"". She credits him with introducing many new terms (usually in French) into the discourse including the ""enfeu"", ""Arts Bereft"" and ""activation of the effigy"". He described double-decker cadaver tombs as tombeaux de grande cérémonie, and originated the term demi-gisants to describe effigies that show the deceased sitting up and supported by their elbows.
The most influential publications following Panofsky's survey are mostly in German and include Kurt Bauch's Das mittelalterliche Grabbild: figürliche Grabmäler des 11. bis 15. Jahrhunderts in Europa (1976) and Hans Körner's Grabmonumente des Mittelalters (1996). Nigel Llewellyn's The state of play: Reflections on the state of research into church monuments discusses the difficulties in providing a full and contextualised history of English tomb art. Writing in 2023, the art historian Joan Holladay noted that the literature on tomb art had ""exploded"" in the previous quarter century. She categorised publications into five main types; the first two being those surveying many examples from a given region or that are connected stylistically. Thirdly, she mentions publications that detail the sources of particular iconographical elements. The fourth type are those that categorise tombs into particular typologies, while finally and more rarely, are the books and papers giving broad and sweeping overviews.

Arc mapping,"Arc mapping is a technique used in fire investigation that relies on finding the locations of electrical arcs and other electrical faults that occurred during a fire; the locations of the electrical faults can then, under some circumstances, indicate the progression of the fire over time.  It is usually performed by a forensic electrical engineer.   It The technique relies on the assumption that, when heat from fire (or from hot gases caused by the fire) impinges on an electrical line (whether or not protected by a conduit), it will melt the wire insulation and cause an electrical fault at the first point that it reaches on the electrical line.  For this to occur, the electrical line must be energized at the time that fire hits it. 


== Origin of fire ==
Arc mapping often aims to determine the point of origin of the fire.   A common assumption used in reaching this goal is that the fire expands uniformly in all directions as it burns, and maintains a circular shape centered on the point of origin; therefore, when an electrical fault occurs on an electrical line, the point of origin is on a perpendicular to that point.   Contrary to this assumption, however, in many cases fire does not extend uniformly; in particular, large local fuel loads, venting, and air currents have a strong effect on fire progression.
Several other factors affect the locations where electrical faults occur.   Electrical faults do not always occur where fire first reaches a conduit, but preferentially occur at bends in a conduit or at locations where wires are pressed together.   The elevation of an electrical line has a strong effect on its exposure to heat, since temperatures in a fire are generally highest near ceiling level, except in the immediate vicinity of the point of origin.   Protection from the fire is an important consideration: being located within a wall or being covered in fiberglass insulation will offer some protection to an electrical line, and will delay electrical faults.


== Electrical faults ==
An electrical fault will only occur if an electrical line is energized - more specifically, if two conductors are at different potentials, and have the capacity to source/sink significant current.   An electrical arcing event will often (though not always) cause a loss of power downstream on the electrical line, such as by severing the conductors or tripping a circuit breaker; as a result, a significant part of arc-map analysis is determining the order in which sections of electrical lines lost power.   In most cases, the electrical faults that occurred furthest downstream occurred first.   Electrical faults can also energize conductors or components that are not normally energized, such as conduits (normally grounded).   (""Energized"" usually refers to a conductor being connected to hot power, as opposed to neutral.   More generally, electrical faults occur between points at different potentials, such as between hot and neutral, between hot and ground, or between hots of two different phases.)


== Electrical arcing ==
Investigators distinguish between electrical arcing and copper that melted due to the high temperatures of the fire.  The term ""electrical arcing"", in fire investigation, often refers to ""melted copper that indicates that electrical arcing occurred"".   ""Melted copper"" generally refers not to copper that is currently melted, but to ""previously melted, resolidified copper"".   NFPA 921 and Kirk's Fire Investigation give some guidelines and illustrations on distinguishing between electrical arcing and other melted copper; however, these strict guidelines occasion much debate.

Medical microbiology,"Medical microbiology, also known as ‘’’clinical microbiology’’’, is the study of microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, which cause human illness and their role in the disease.
The microbes and the branch of microbiology are the most studied due to their great importance to medicine.
Medical microbiology studies development and progress of the infectious disease in a patient and in human population (epidemiology). It is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology. It is a branch of medicine and microbiology and includes five sciences: bacteriology, virology, parasitology, immunology and mycology.


== History of medical microbiology ==
In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seed like entities through direct, indirect contact and contact over long distances with an infection.
Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch are the founders of medical microbiology. Louis Pasteur is famous for his experiments when he disproved the theory of spontaneous generation. He offered method for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies. Robert Koch contributed to the germ theory of disease, provided that specific diseases were caused by specific microbes. He developed criteria known as the Koch's postulates and was among first to isolate bacteria in pure culture resulting in his description of several bacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis.


== Fields in medical microbiology ==
Microbial physiology is the study of microbial growth, microbial metabolism and microbial cell structure.
Microbial genetics is the study of how genes are organized and regulated in microbes in relation to their cellular functions.
Parasitology investigates parasites. The specimen here is feces, blood, urine, sputum, and other samples.
Virology identifies viruses in specimens of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.
Immunology/Serology uses antigen-antibody interaction as a diagnostic tool, determines compatibility of transplanted organs.
A medical microbiologist is a specialist in medical (clinical) microbiology.
He provides clinical consultations on the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases. He establishes and directs infection control programs across public health care, infectious disease prevention and epidemiology.
He provides the scientific and administrative direction of a clinical microbiology laboratory. Such laboratory receives almost any clinical specimen, including swabs, feces, urine, blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, possible infected tissue. The work here is mainly concerned with cultures, to look for suspected pathogens which, if found, are identified based on biochemical tests. In addition, sensitivity testing is carried out to determine whether the pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine. Results are reported with the identified organism(s) and the type and amount of drug(s) that should be prescribed for the patient.
Medical microbiologist is also involved in teaching at all levels, and in research. It provided the development of vaccines against invading organisms. Deadly and debilitating diseases such as small pox, polio, and tuberculosis have been either eradicated or become more treatable.
There are claims that consuming probiotics (bacteria potentially beneficial to the digestive system) and/or prebiotics (substances consumed to promote the growth of probiotic microorganisms)  contributes to human health. Microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of cancer.  Strains of non-pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors, deliver therapeutic proteins.

Cursor,"A cursor is a shape on a computer screen that shows where actions made with the keyboard or mouse will make a change.  Earlier a cursor marked a point on a slide rule. 
There are 2 types of cursor that most people will use.

The Mouse cursor:  The pointer on the screen which the person using the computer can move using the computer mouse.  This cursor allows the person to select or ""click"" items with the mouse.  On most computers mouse cursors are the shape of an arrow.

The Text Cursor:  Usually seen as a vertical line or rectangle that flashes on and off. The Cursor tells the person using the computer where they are typing things on the screen.  They can type letters, numbers and symbols where the cursor is.
The computer automatically moves the cursor one space to the right when a letter, number or symbol is typed.  The cursor can be moved to the start of the next line by pressing the Enter Key.
Most keyboards also have 4 cursor keys to move the text cursor up, down, left or right.",0
Ponerology,"In theology, ponerology (from Greek πονηρός ponērós, ""evil"") is the study of evil. Major subdivisions of the study are the nature of evil, the origin of evil, and evil in relation to the Divine Government.
Karl Immanuel Nitzsch outlined his System der christlichen Lehre (System of Christian Doctrine) into three major rubrics: Agathology, or the Doctrine of the Good; Ponerology, or the Doctrine of the Bad; and Soteriology, or the Doctrine of Salvation. He further subdivided ponerology into the topics of Sin and of Death.

Revelation,"A revelation is a source of information that is given to some people and meant to share with others from a government, influential people or a supernatural deity. In monotheistic literature, a revelation is given by God to a prophet or someone God wants to make a prophet and it is supposed to be told to others. The last book in the Bible is also coincidentally called Revelation.
In Catholicism and other Christian denominations, John is also called Saint John and was Jesus Christ’s 3rd/4th called disciple. John wrote a Gospel called The Gospel according to John. He also wrote 1st, 2nd and 3rd John. The most famous verse in the Bible was written by him in John 3:16 during Christ’s conversation with the pharisee Nicodemus.


== The Book of Revelation ==

In the beginning of the New Testament book of Revelation, John was in exile in the island of Patmos, an island in the Aegean Sea and part of Greece’s territory now, because he refused to look at Emperor Domitian as Lord and God. John explains this and he also says he saw the Heavens, so we can suggest that he was writing what he saw while having his revelation or vision —whichever you choose to call it. Jesus tells him to send a message to 7 churches in Asia Minor, that is Turkey. These are Ephesus, Symrna, Pergammum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea. He explains He knows the suffering and He is watching over them.
A few chapters in and we see Apocalyptic literature. This was very common in the writing of Jews and Christians during the great persecution of Early Christians in the Roman Empire before Emperor Constantine made Christianity the state religion. You see a lot of beasts and creatures and then the greatly feared Antichrist.
The 2 witnesses will be 2 prophets who God will raise from the dead and they will preach for three and a half years when the Antichrist will come and kill them both. Then because they have been slaughtered people from all around the world will drink and exchange gifts out of merriness and joyfulness because those 2 witnesses have died and nobody can shine the light of their sins. For three and a half days, they will not be allowed to be given their final dignity and put into graves. Then after 3 and a half days, God will raise them up from the dead and everyone will be shocked (imaginable) also will be ascending into Heaven.
The Antichrist is prominent in Revelation and is spoken a lot about. Christian and Jewish elders believe it will be an influential government that will trick everyone. But for everyone else its probably a tall, well-built man who will slaughter the Jews just when he has gained their trust.",0

Camping,"Camping is a leisure activity, usually during summer when school children are on holiday, where people leave their homes and spend one or more nights outdoors. They may be tourists seeking nature, adventure, or a different environment. They may sleep in a campervan or trailer, a tent, or in the open air in good weather. Winter camping is less common but in some parts of the world, tents are people's homes year around. Rich people began camping for fun in the early 20th century. When more people could afford it, many more did it.
When camping, people usually prepare food to eat that is easy to make.  If they were hunting or fishing, they may cook the animal or fish they caught over a campfire.  
Dangers can arise, such as wild animals or illness from drinking unclean water.",0

Astronomy,"Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial bodies. Stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae are studied, as are supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Astronomy includes the development, physics, chemistry, meteorology and movement of celestial bodies. The big questions are the structure and development of the universe.
Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. The patterns of stars in the night sky were called constellations by the Arabs. They used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant crops.
Astrophysics is an important part of astronomy. A related subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the universe as a whole, and the way the universe changed over time. Astronomy is not the same as astrology, a belief that the motion of the stars and the planets may affect human lives.
There are two main types of astronomy, observational and theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy explains what we see. It predicts what might happen. Observations show whether the predictions work.  The main work of astronomy is to explain puzzling features of the Universe.  For many years the most important issue was the motions of planets. Many other topics are now studied.
Day-time astronomy is possible. First, there's the Sun, but observing directly is dangerous. It is too bright, and can burn your eyes and can cause permanent blindness. To look at the Sun you need  proper shields and equipment. Some other individual bright stars and planets can be seen during daylight hours through a telescope or a powerful pair of binoculars.


== History of astronomy ==


=== Ancient history ===
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year. Early civilisations such as the Maya people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe. For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it.  This is known as geocentrism. Astronomy is from the Greek astron (ἄστρον) meaning ""star"" and nomos (nόμος) meaning ""law"")
Ancient Greeks tried to explain the motions of the Sun and stars by taking measurements. A mathematician named Eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a sphere. A theory by another mathematician named Aristarchus was, that the Sun is the center and the Earth is moving around it. This is known as heliocentrism. Only a few people thought it was right. The rest continued to believe in the geocentric model. Most of the names of constellations and stars come from Greeks of that time.
Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the Middle Ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth.  They also learned from the ancients by translating Greek books into Arabic.


=== Renaissance to modern era ===

During the renaissance a priest named Nicolaus Copernicus thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of everything. Based on previous works, he said that the Earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the Sun. This brought back the old idea of heliocentrism. Galileo Galilei built his own telescopes, and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time. He agreed with Copernicus. The Catholic Church thought Galileo was wrong. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. Heliocentric ideas were soon improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, who invented the theory of gravity.
After Galileo, people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae.


=== Modern era ===
The 20th century after 1920 saw important changes in astronomy.
In the early 1920s it began to be accepted that the galaxy in which we live, the Milky Way, is not the only galaxy. The existence of other galaxies was settled by Edwin Hubble, who identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy. It was also Hubble who proved that the universe was expanding. There were many other galaxies at large distances and they are receding, moving away from our galaxy. That was completely unexpected.
In 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.
The opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example pulsars, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that (so it was thought) it implied an artificial source.
The period after World War II saw more observatories. Large and accurate telescopes were built and operated at good observing sites, usually by governments. For example, Bernard Lovell began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military radar equipment. By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii, a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.
The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites.
Space telescopes gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The X-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet light and parts of the infra-red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.
From 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.


== Discoveries ==
Discoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.  Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth, or a galaxy like our Milky Way.  Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.


=== Bodies ===
For convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.


==== Solar ====
Planets
Asteroids
Comets


==== Galactic ====
Stars
Diffuse Objects:

Nebulas
Clusters
Compact Stars:

White dwarf stars
Neutron stars
Black holes


==== Cosmic ====
Galaxies
Galaxy clusters
Superclusters


=== Phenomena ===
Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly.  These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a ""burst"" of energy.  They include:

Supernovas
Novas
Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way.  The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle.  Periodic phenomena include:

Pulsars
Variable stars
Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago.  The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity.  In this way, it is ""noise"", the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy.  The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions.  The principal astronomical example is: cosmic background radiation.


== Methods ==


=== Instruments ===
Telescopes are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter.
Spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light. This shows what something is made of.
Many telescopes are in satellites. They are space observatories. The Earth’s atmosphere blocks some parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but special telescopes  above the atmosphere can detect that radiation.
Radio astronomy uses radio telescopes. Aperture synthesis combines smaller telescopes to create a phased array, which works like a telescope as big as the distance between the smaller telescopes.


=== Techniques ===
There are way  astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens.  Light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera.  For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen.  One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration (which is like longer exposures in photography).


==== Integration ====
Astronomical sources do not move much: only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens. As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background, until it can be seen.
Telescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures.  Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months. In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer, which overlays the images after correcting for movement.


==== Adaptive optics ====
Adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something, to see it better.


=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it. The observation is first stored as data. This data then has various techniques used to analyse it.


==== Fourier analysis ====
Fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave).  If so, it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern, and find many things including new planets.


== Subfields of astronomy ==
Pulsars pulse regularly in radio waves.  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low-mass X-ray binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found. Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.
This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy.


=== Solar astronomy ===

Solar astronomy is the study of the Sun. The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away. It is the easiest to observe in detail. Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged particles called the Solar wind is constantly sent off from the Sun. The Solar wind hitting the Earth's magnetic field causes the northern lights.
Stellar astronomy
Stellar astronomy, sometimes stellar astrophysics is the scientific study of stars, their formation, evolution and fate (stellar evolution). In the most basic sense, Stellar Astronomy attempts to answer the questions to the universe's most common phenomena — stars. Heavily relating with Galactic and Planetary Astronomy.


=== Planetary astronomy ===
Planetary astronomy is the study of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own Solar System have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as Cassini-Huygens (Saturn) and the Voyager 1 and 2.


=== Galactic astronomy ===
Galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies.  Studying distant galaxies is a good way of learning about our own galaxy, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe.  Galactic astronomers try to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed by using different types of telescopes and computer simulations.


=== Gravitational wave astronomy ===
Gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the Universe in the gravitational wave spectrum.  So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum.  Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include white dwarves, neutron stars and black holes.  Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been limited.


== Unsolved problems ==
Great discoveries also produce unsolved problems. This is just a short-list:

Dark matter and dark energy: what are they?
Ultimate fate of the Universe? What will it be?
Why is lithium 4 times less than predicted?
Origin of supermassive black holes.
The source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
The existence of life elsewhere.

Heart pine,"Heart pine refers to the heartwood of the pine tree, which is the non-living center of the tree trunk, while the sapwood is the outer living layer which transports nutrients. 

The heartwood from the pine tree, heart pine, is preferred by woodworkers and builders over the sapwood, due to its strength, hardness and golden red coloration. The longleaf pine, the favored tree for heart pine, nearly went extinct due to logging.  Before the 18th century, in the United States, longleaf pine forests, covered approximately 30-60 million acres along the coastal plain from Virginia's southern tip to eastern Texas. These pine trees, 80 to 120 feet tall, require 100 to 150 years to become full size and can live up to 500 years. An inch of heart pine requires 30 years growth. Due to deforestation and over-harvesting since colonial days, only about 3% of the original Longleaf Pine forest remains.
The source of much of the available heart pine found on the market is longleaf pine from old buildings.  Before 1900 it was a source for poles, pilings, posts, sawlogs, flooring, plywood, pulpwood and naval stores (tapped for turpentine).
Currently heart pine for building and woodworking is procured by reclaiming old lumber and recovering logs, felled pre-1900, from rivers.

Thermite,"Thermite is an incendiary mixture. It is not an explosive material, but can burn very fast and very hot.
It is made of an oxide of a less reactive metal mixed with a more reactive metal. One of the most common mixtures is iron(III) oxide-aluminium. The iron(III) oxide oxidizes the aluminium, being reduced to iron in the process. The aluminium is oxidized to aluminium oxide.
Many other metal oxides and metals can be used for thermite. Some metals that can be used are boron, magnesium, calcium, titanium, zinc, or silicon. Some metal oxides that can be used are copper(II) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, silicon dioxide, boron trioxide, or lead(II,IV) oxide. A metal cannot be used with its metal oxide. The metal has to be more reactive than the metal in the oxide, or the thermite will not work.


== Reaction and ignition ==
The reaction for an aluminium-iron(III) oxide thermite is this:

2 Al + Fe2O3 → Al2O3 + 2 Fe
It is difficult to ignite thermite. It needs to be very hot. Ribbons of magnesium metal are used. A mixture of potassium permanganate and glycerin can be used to ignite thermite. It can be ignited by a flint lighter or a child's sparkler. It can be mixed with sulfur to make thermate, which makes it easier to melt the iron.
Contrary to popular opinion, metals can burn. Common metals need to be powdered, though, or they will conduct the heat away too fast to start a fire.


== History ==
The thermite (thermit) reaction was discovered in 1893. German chemist Hans Goldschmidt patented it in 1895. People called it the ""Goldschmidt reaction"" or ""Goldschmidt process"". Goldschmidt was trying to make very pure metals without the use of carbon in smelting. He soon discovered the value of thermite in welding. It started to be used in the early 1900s to weld train tracks.


== Uses ==
Thermite is used for its original purpose, welding railroad rails together. It is also used to weld wires. Thermite is also used to make some metals. Chromium can be made by a thermite reaction between chromium(III) oxide and aluminium. The first uranium was made by a thermite. Thermite may also be used in fireworks to ignite other incendiaries.
Thermite was used in the military as an incendiary weapon. It is mainly used to destroy buildings and equipment as it melts the metal easily. Barium nitrate can be added to thermite to make an easier-burning mixture. Especially during World War II, militaries dropped thousands of bombs containing thermite on cities, starting fires everywhere.


== Safety ==
Thermite is not safe to make at home. It releases ultraviolet light which can damage the eyes. It also makes a very hot flame that can melt iron. It is extremely difficult to extinguish. Streams of molten iron can flow out of a thermite mixture, igniting everything it touches. Some metals can boil and burst into flames when placed in thermite, such as zinc. If it is preheated then ignited, thermite can burn very fast, releasing a huge amount of heat and light. If it is dropped in water it can boil water very fast, making an explosion. Dropping it on ice can make the ice explode, however it is safe to drop it into a three-liter beaker filled with lightly moist sand.

Flammability limit,"Mixtures of dispersed combustible materials (such as gaseous or vaporised fuels, and some dusts) and oxygen in the air will burn only if the fuel concentration lies within well-defined lower and upper bounds determined experimentally, referred to as flammability limits or explosive limits. Combustion can range in violence from deflagration through detonation.
Limits vary with temperature and pressure, but are normally expressed in terms of volume percentage at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure. These limits are relevant both in producing and optimising explosion or combustion, as in an engine, or to preventing it, as in uncontrolled explosions of build-ups of combustible gas or dust. Attaining the best combustible or explosive mixture of a fuel and air (the stoichiometric proportion) is important in internal combustion engines such as gasoline or diesel engines.
The standard reference work is still that elaborated by Michael George Zabetakis, a fire safety engineering specialist, using an apparatus developed by the United States Bureau of Mines.


== Violence of combustion ==
Combustion can vary in degree of violence. A deflagration is a propagation of a combustion zone at a velocity less than the speed of sound in the unreacted medium. A detonation is a propagation of a combustion zone at a velocity greater than the speed of sound in the unreacted medium. An explosion is the bursting or rupture of an enclosure or container due to the development of internal pressure from a deflagration or detonation as defined in NFPA 69.


== Limits ==


=== Lower flammability limit ===
Lower flammability limit (LFL): The lowest concentration (percentage) of a gas or a vapor in air capable of producing a flash of fire in the presence of an ignition source (arc, flame, heat). The term is considered by many safety professionals to be the same as the lower explosive level (LEL). At a concentration in air lower than the LFL, gas mixtures are ""too lean"" to burn. 
Methane gas has an LFL of 4.4%. If the atmosphere has less than 4.4% methane, an explosion cannot occur even if a source of ignition is present. From the health and safety perspective, the LEL concentration is considered to be Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH), where a more stringent exposure limit does not exist for the flammable gas.
Percentage reading on combustible air monitors should not be confused with the LFL concentrations. Explosimeters designed and calibrated to a specific gas may show the relative concentration of the atmosphere to the LFL—the LFL being 100%. A 5% displayed LFL reading for methane, for example, would be equivalent to 5% multiplied by 4.4%, or approximately 0.22% methane by volume at 20 degrees C. Control of the explosion hazard is usually achieved by sufficient natural or mechanical ventilation, to limit the concentration of flammable gases or vapors to a maximum level of 25% of their lower explosive or flammable limit.


=== Upper flammability limit ===
Upper flammability limit (UFL): Highest concentration (percentage) of a gas or a vapor in air capable of producing a flash of fire in the presence of an ignition source (arc, flame, heat). Concentrations higher than UFL or UEL are ""too rich"" to burn. Operating above the UFL is usually avoided for safety because air leaking in can bring the mixture into combustibility range.


=== Influence of temperature, pressure and composition ===
Flammability limits of mixtures of several combustible gases can be calculated using Le Chatelier's mixing rule for combustible volume fractions

and similar for UFL.
Temperature, pressure, and the concentration of the oxidizer also influences flammability limits. Higher temperature or pressure, as well as higher concentration of the oxidizer (primarily oxygen in air), results in lower LFL and higher UFL, hence the gas mixture will be easier to explode.
Usually atmospheric air supplies the oxygen for combustion, and limits assume the normal concentration of oxygen in air. Oxygen-enriched atmospheres enhance combustion, lowering the LFL and increasing the UFL, and vice versa; an atmosphere devoid of an oxidizer is neither flammable nor explosive for any fuel concentration (except for gases that can energetically decompose even in the absence of an oxidizer, such as acetylene). Significantly increasing the fraction of inert gases in an air mixture, at the expense of oxygen, increases the LFL and decreases the UFL.


== Controlling explosive atmospheres ==


=== Gas and vapor ===
Controlling gas and vapor concentrations outside the flammable limits is a major consideration in occupational safety and health. Methods used to control the concentration of a potentially explosive gas or vapor include use of sweep gas, an unreactive gas such as nitrogen or argon to dilute the explosive gas before coming in contact with air. Use of scrubbers or adsorption resins to remove explosive gases before release are also common. Gases can also be maintained safely at concentrations above the UEL, although a breach in the storage container can lead to explosive conditions or intense fires.


=== Dusts ===
Dusts also have upper and lower explosion limits, though the upper limits are hard to measure and of little practical importance. Lower flammability limits for many organic materials are in the range of 10–50 g/m3, which is much higher than the limits set for health reasons, as is the case for the LEL of many gases and vapours. Dust clouds of this concentration are hard to see through for more than a short distance, and normally only exist inside process equipment.
Flammability limits also depend on the particle size of the dust involved, and are not intrinsic properties of the material. In addition, a concentration above the LEL can be created suddenly from settled dust accumulations, so management by routine monitoring, as is done with gases and vapours, is of no value. The preferred method of managing combustible dust is by preventing accumulations of settled dust through process enclosure, ventilation, and surface cleaning. However, lower flammability limits may be relevant to plant design.


=== Volatile liquids ===
Situations caused by evaporation of flammable liquids into the air-filled void volume of a container may be limited by flexible container volume or by using an immiscible fluid to fill the void volume. Hydraulic tankers use displacement of water when filling a tank with petroleum.


== Examples ==
The flammable/explosive limits of some gases and vapors are given below. Concentrations are given in percent by volume of air.

Class IA liquids with a flash point less than 73 °F (23 °C) and boiling point less than 100 °F (38 °C) have a NFPA 704 flammability rating of 4
Class IB liquids with a flash point less than 73 °F (23 °C) and a boiling point equal to or greater than 100 °F (38 °C) and class IC liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than 73 °F (23 °C), but less than 100 °F (38 °C) have a NFPA 704 flammability rating of 3
Class II liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than 100 °F (38 °C), but less than 140 °F (60 °C) and class IIIA liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than 140 °F (60 °C), but less than 200 °F (93 °C) have a NFPA 704 flammability rating of 2
Class IIIB liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than 200 °F (93 °C) have a NFPA 704 flammability rating of 1


== ASTM E681 ==

In the U.S. the most common method of measuring LFLs and UFLs is ASTM E681. This standard test is required for HAZMAT Class 2 Gases and for determining refrigerant flammability classifications. This standard uses visual observations of flame propagation in 5 or 12 L spherical glass vessels to measure the flammability limits. Flammable conditions are defined as those for which a flame propagates outside a 90° cone angle.

Language event,"Language event (German: Sprachereignis) is an act or instance of written or spoken communication. In the 1920s earliest use of the word was found in Journal of Philosophy. In theology this word was used by Ernest Fuchs, relating to New Hermeneutic. Fuchs' doctrine of language helped to inspire a ""new quest"" for the historical Jesus because it could now be said that Jesus' words and deeds constituted that ""language event"" in which faith first entered into language, thereby becoming available as an existential possibility within language, the ""house of being"" (Heidegger). Conversely, the reality of God's love is verbalized in Jesus' words and deeds recorded in the Gospels and is thus preserved as language gain (German: Sprachgewinn). In the freedom of proclamation God's presence in the gospel as the ""Yes of love"" happens again-that is, comes to be as language, opening up the future to authentic existence (faith, hope, and love)


== Paul ==
According to the Epistles of Paul, the proclaimed Word of God effects and creates faith. Faith is thus the creature of the word (""creatura verbi""). So it says in Paul's letter to the Romans (Rom 10,17 EU):
""Faith thus comes from preaching, but preaching by the word of Christ.""
Thus, for Paul, faith arises from hearing the apostolic message of faith. Yet this ""fides ex auditu"" is a gift from God.


== Martin Luther ==
Martin Luther defines the believing people as ""homo audiens"".  According to him, listening to the Word requires faith in man.  This ""verbality"" of faith is central to his theology. Again and again, this emphasizes the vocabulary of faith and that the word should be praised as a means of grace. Faith embraces the word that is offered to it. So it is z. E.g. in his second Psalm lecture (1519/20) on Ps 18.45 VUL:
""Actum igitur credendi (ut vocant) nescio quibus verbis possis aptius eloqui quam ista periphrasi divina:"" auditu auris audivit mihi "", hoc est, stultus sibi fuit populus gentium, ut mihi crederet in his, quae non videret nec caperet.""
- Martin Luther: WA 5, 537, 3
""Therefore, I do not know with which words you could pronounce the event of faith (as they call it) more fittingly than by this divine description:"" It [the people] hears me with obedient ears "", that is to say, simple is for themselves the people of People so that it believed me in things that neither saw nor grasped. ""
By referring to the passage as a ""transcription"", Luther means the ""inner"" and ""spiritual"" hearing  through which the act of believing (actum credendi) is characterized. In accordance with such a Lutheran understanding of the word, Fuchs will later develop his theory of the language event.


== Ernst Fuchs ==
Ernest Fuchs insisted that speeches from the language event is in the Pauline-Lutheran tradition. For Fuchs, word and faith essentially belong together: faith has its essence from its relationship to the word. Faith is the listening to the word that meets it, by which he means the Gospel concretely. For this reason, Fuchs sees the speech event as the unfolding of faith: it causes the listener to change the situation from ""not-being"" to being in the existence of God. This understanding of speech thus represents a fundamental category of his hermeneutics. Fuchs is keen to emphasize the passivity of man. For this he uses the term of silence. Man does not move in her, but is moved by the speech event. Language live on the silence.
In the language event, the language itself leads to that silence of which it lives. In addition, Fuchs sees his statements of eloquent and significant language parallel to the distinction between being and being (see also Heidegger). While merely indicative language offers only an expression of beings, a speech event justifies being and allows it to be present. Fuchs applies his doctrine of the linguistic event to various theological disciplines, namely, the preaching of Jesus, the theology of Paul and the Easter event.


== Gerhard Ebeling ==
Gerhard Ebeling continues to use the concept of the language event as a demarcation to dogmatic doctrine. Ebeling understands the sacrament as ""language event"".


== Eberhard Jüngel ==
Eberhard Jüngel, theologically influenced by Ernest Fuchs, proved to be a proponent of the language event. He took it over in his book ""Paul and Jesus"" as a demarcation to Rudolf Bultmann.

Judgment,"The word judgment (also spelled judgement) means making a decision carefully, after studying and comparing all evidence that is available. A judgment may be about what is the best thing to do, or how to do it, or how to classify something or someone, or what to think about something.  
Judgment may differ according to the topic:

In law it is a decision made by a judge, about whether a crime was committed and, if so, whether punishment should be given.
In psychology it is a decision based on wisdom. It is about making sensible decisions.
In religion it is about reward and punishment from  a god.  This is often called ""Divine Judgment"".
The word can be used in the sense of ""opinion"": ""In my judgment....""

Renaissance in Ferrara,"The Renaissance in Ferrara began with the signoria of Leonello d'Este around the mid-15th century. Under Leonello's patronage, Ferrara became a hub for the arts and intellectual thought, attracting prominent artists and scholars of the time. A significant contribution came from the school of painters, including Cosmè Tura, Francesco del Cossa, and Ercole de' Roberti. These artists were known for their innovative use of color, intricate detail, and emotive expressions, helping to define early Italian Renaissance art. 
The 16th century saw the emergence of another influential school led by Dosso Dossi, who was known for his imaginative and often fantastical landscapes and subjects. In addition to painting, Ferrara was a vibrant center for literature, music, and architecture, contributing to its reputation as a cultural powerhouse during the Renaissance. The Este family, as patrons of the arts, played a crucial role in fostering this environment, supporting not only visual artists but also poets and musicians, creating a rich tapestry of Renaissance culture that still resonates today.


== History ==

The house of Este in Ferrara had been present in northern Italy since the late 14th century, when Niccolò d'Este funded the University of Ferrara and started the construction of the Castello Estense. Courtly culture played a significant role, as evidenced by the library's collection of chivalric stories reflecting interest in the medieval fable world. Additionally, materials on astrology and esotericism were prominent. Artistic pursuits flourished under the patronage of the Este. Pisanello, who produced several medals for Lionello d'Este, was a highly regarded artist. The Este court also supported both the ornate international style, exemplified by Belbello da Pavia (creator of the Bible of Niccolò d'Este), and the humanist style, represented by Taddeo Crivelli (creator of the Bible of Borso d'Este). 
Leonello d'Este's reign further expanded the cultural influence of the House of Este. His patronage encompassed a wide range of emerging artistic movements, fostering a unique environment within Italy. Educated by the humanist Guarino Veronese, Leonello cultivated relationships with prominent artists of the time, including Leon Battista Alberti, Jacopo Bellini, Piero della Francesca, and Andrea Mantegna (present in Ferrara between 1449 and 1451) and Pisanello. He also established a collection of antiquities and a tapestry manufactory, strengthening ties with Flanders. Several transalpine artists, such as Rogier van der Weyden and Jean Fouquet, resided in Ferrara during this period. The Este collections, containing works by these artists, attracted the attention of visiting Italian artists, facilitating a cross-pollination between the two artistic schools.


== Painting ==
The reign of Borso d'Este (1450–1471) witnessed the development of a distinct style in Ferrarese painting, which incorporated influences from diverse sources. Courtly culture played a role, alongside elements derived from the works of Piero della Francesca, particularly his use of perspective and light. The meticulous realism of Early Netherlandish painters and the influence of Donatello are also evident. Artists trained by the workshop of Francesco Squarcione further contributed to this artistic movement. Ferrarese artists elaborated upon this approach, integrating characteristics such as defined lines, heightened emotional expression, and a fusion of elegance and expressiveness.


=== The Studiolo di Belfiore ===

The development of the school of Ferrara is exemplified by the surviving decorations from the Studiolo di Belfiore. Commissioned by Lionello d'Este, the Studiolo was completed during the reign of Borso following the dismantling of the Delizia di Belfiore palace. These decorations included intarsia work by the da Lendinara brothers and a cycle of paintings depicting the Muses on panel, which were dispersed or destroyed after the disappearance of the palace.
Michele Pannonio's Thalia exemplifies the stylistic features of the Ferrarese school. The painting demonstrates connections to International Gothic, evident in the slender and elegant figure with flowing drapery that breaks at the knee. Additionally, elements of the Paduan Renaissance are incorporated, such as the expansive treatment of the throne and the inclusion of decorative details that evoke an earlier artistic style.
Polyhymnia, formerly attributed to Francesco del Cossa and now believed to be created by an anonymous Ferrarese artist, shows instead the influence of Piero della Francesca's style, particularly in its composition, which is set against a distinct, open panorama.
Cosmè Tura's Calliope incorporates several features that became characteristic of the Ferrarese school. These include a strong compositional foundation established through clear perspective, a vantage point positioned below the figure, and an elaborately rendered throne. Additionally, the work integrates elements associated with the Paduan style of Francesco Squarcione, particularly in the use of light, which further accentuates a sense of heightened tension.


=== Cosmè Tura ===

Cosmè Tura is considered the founder of the Ferrarese school. He was later joined by Francesco del Cossa and Ercole de' Roberti. Despite distinct artistic personalities, their works share a common preference for meticulously rendered figures, sharply defined profiles, and the use of chiaroscuro, which creates an illusion of materials resembling embossed metal or polished stone.
Cosmè Tura's artistic style is demonstrably present in the Ferrara Cathedral Organ Case, completed in 1469. This double-sided work depicts the Annunciation when opened and Saint George and the Princess when closed. The architectural elements within the Annunciation scene exhibit stylistic similarities to the work of Andrea Mantegna, particularly evident in the rendering of draperies and the inclusion of layered rock formations in the background landscape. Additionally, the work incorporates naturalistic elements, such as meticulously rendered details. Notably, the bas-reliefs positioned beneath the arches, depicting the Planets, allude to the courtly world. Tura skillfully integrates these diverse artistic influences into a cohesive artwork. The Saint George and the Princess panel features a dynamic composition characterized by clear and sharp outlines, contrasting highlights, and a heightened level of emotional expression achieved through the use of exaggerated facial features and animal figures


=== Francesco del Cossa ===

Francesco del Cossa initially trained under Cosmè Tura but developed a distinct artistic approach. His work placed a greater emphasis on the teachings of Piero della Francesca, resulting in more composed and solemn figures. While his participation in the decoration of the Studiolo of the Palazzo Belfiore remains uncertain, he demonstrably contributed to the other major Ferrarese painting project, the Salone dei Mesi in Palazzo Schifanoia. This large cycle of frescoes involved the collaboration of several artists, probably under the direction of Cosmè Tura. The iconographic program, devised by Pellegrino Prisciano, drew upon astronomical, philosophical, and literary references. Originally, the decoration comprised twelve sections, one for each month, of which only seven survive today. Each section is divided into three tiers: the upper tier depicts the patron deity of the month surrounded by figures engaged in typical activities associated with that month. The central tier, featuring a blue background, displays the zodiac sign and three decans (astrological subdivisions). The lower tier showcases scenes related to the figure of Borso d'Este. By praising the Este lord and his ideals, the entire artwork served to celebrate the state of Ferrara, encompassing its various functions, from representation to governance.
Francesco del Cossa's contribution to the Salone dei Mesi exemplifies this distinction. The March section, attributed to him, features solid, simplified forms, luminous colors, and a meticulously constructed perspective. This approach contrasts with Cosmè Tura's work, which often employs more stylized, almost crystallized figures.


=== Ercole de' Roberti ===

The third prominent figure of the Ferrarese school is Ercole de' Roberti, who also contributed to the Salone dei Mesi. His section, September, exhibits a distinct stylistic approach characterized by geometrically stylized forms and figures imbued with a heightened sense of dynamism. This dynamic effect is achieved through the use of taut and angular contours, resulting in a portrayal that departs from naturalism but possesses a powerful expressive force.
Ercole de' Roberti's panels depicting the Stories of Saint Vincent Ferrer (1473, Pinacoteca Vaticana) showcase an evolution in his artistic style. The architectural elements within these works exhibit a more rationalized organization compared to his earlier work. However, certain stylistic elements persist, including the use of fragmented figure outlines, forcefully rendered drapery, and dreamlike landscapes. These characteristics collectively contribute to a sense of unease, reflecting the anxieties of the period that ultimately led to a questioning of Renaissance ideals at the century's end.
The Pala di Santa Maria in Porto (1479–1481), created for the church of Santa Maria in Porto, near Ravenna, exemplifies a contrasting approach. In this work, the expressive tensions are confined to a few bas-reliefs adorning the base of the Virgin's throne. The overall composition prioritizes a sense of serene and balanced harmony, achieved through the use of symmetrical color arrangements. The dynamic architecture of the throne adds a lively element, while simultaneously revealing an open panorama at its base. This lower section alludes to the mythical foundation of the church and features small columns meticulously rendered with sensitivity to the light effects on marble.


=== The 16th century ===

The artistic lineage established by the 15th-century masters of the Ferrarese school waned by the 1590s, with a decline in the production of high-caliber artworks. At the turn of the 16th century, the House of Este began to patronize artists with diverse training backgrounds. These artists were familiar with the latest artistic developments of the Roman and Venetian Renaissance. Local artists sought out Venice as a result of the alliances established by the House of Este and their preferences. The works of Titian, who visited Ferrara on several occasions, exerted a significant influence on these artists. They incorporated elements of his style, particularly his use of imaginative narratives, which resonated with the city's cultivated literary environment.
The major court painters of this period were Il Garofalo, Ludovico Mazzolino, and Dosso Dossi. The presence of writers such as Ludovico Ariosto cultivated an atmosphere that favored fantastical imagery, a trend particularly evident in the design of Alfonso II d'Este's extraordinary studiolo and the camerini d'alabastro which was destroyed in 1598. Directed by Dosso Dossi, the decoration of the camerini included a series of remarkable Baccanali canvases by various artists including Giovanni Bellini and Titian. Dosso's style demonstrably absorbed certain elements from Titian, such as a rich color palette and expansive landscapes. However, Dosso also incorporated an inventive approach, particularly in his depictions of literary and mythological subjects. These mythological motifs by Dosso remained influential even for early 17th-century Emilian painters, such as Annibale Carracci.
Lorenzo Costa, another prominent painter, established himself as the court painter in Mantua following the death of Andrea Mantegna.
The latter half of the 16th century witnessed a period of artistic transition in Ferrara. Following the passing of Dosso Dossi and the decline in commissions from the Este court, the artistic community maintained a degree of vitality. This was due in part to the presence of the Filippi family. Among them, Sebastiano Filippi, also known as Bastianino, achieved recognition for his Last Judgment adorning the apse of Ferrara Cathedral. Later, the local artistic scene benefited from the contributions of Carlo Bononi. However, with the annexation of Ferrara by the Papal States and the subsequent transfer of the Este capital to Modena, the city's prominence as a leading artistic center diminished. This decline coincided with the dismantling of the famed camerini d'alabastro, resulting in the dispersal of its decorative elements to various museums.


== Architecture and urban planning ==

In 1443, Leonello d'Este commissioned Leon Battista Alberti to design the bell tower of the Duomo and to arrange the base of the equestrian monument to Niccolò III. However, Alberti's influence on the city's architectural landscape remained limited. The overall character of Ferrara's architecture continued to be defined by the late 14th-century tradition, particularly evident in the use of decorative terracotta. Due to defensive needs and the growing demand for housing, the interventions in the city by the Este focused mainly on urban planning issues rather than the construction of individual buildings. Ferrara was a medieval city with a core of narrow, winding streets, with squares and enclosed to the south by the Po di Volano and to the north by the Giovecca canal, with the only landmarks being the Duomo, the Este residence and the Castle of San Michele.

The mid-15th century witnessed the city's first significant expansion under the rule of Borso d'Este. However, it was Ercole I who spearheaded a transformative urban planning project heavily influenced by the Renaissance concept of the ""ideal city."" This project, known today as the Erculean Addition, is recognized as one of the earliest examples of its kind in Europe and has contributed to Ferrara's designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ercole commissioned the architect Biagio Rossetti to design a doubling of the city according to a new rational scheme, the Erculean Addition.
The Giovecca canal was filled in and transformed into a wide avenue, the Corso della Giovecca. This thoroughfare served as a vital connection between the new and old quarters of the city. Regular extensions were designed at the intersections with existing medieval streets, facilitating a smooth merging of the old and new urban fabric. Drawing on the principles outlined by the Roman architect Vitruvius, the new city area was laid out in an orthogonal grid pattern. This rational approach resulted in a network of streets that intersected at right angles. The orthogonal grid was further defined by two principal axes: Via degli Angeli (today Corso Ercole I), which traced an earlier route connecting the castello and Belfiore, and Via dei Prioni, which ran from the Po Gate to the Sea Gate in an east-west direction. This particular axis, which was completely new and fully ""public"" in flavor (as opposed to the other axis that remained linked to the passage of the dukes), was particularly emphasized with a large square: Piazza Ariostea.

Biagio Rossetti, the architect behind the Erculean Addition, incorporated several features to ensure a harmonious integration with the existing city. He strategically placed areas of green space throughout the new district. These green spaces functioned as transitional zones, easing the visual and spatial shift between the orthogonal grid of the new layout and the organic street patterns of the older city. The overall design of the Erculean Addition prioritized the creation of contained and visually engaging architectural experiences rather than grand, open vistas at street ends. This approach fostered a sense of intimacy and encouraged exploration within the new city district. The intersection of the two main axes, Via degli Angeli and Via dei Prioni, is known as the ""Quadrivio degli Angeli"" and serves as a key example of Rossetti's design principles in action. Rossetti's most prominent structure within the Quadrivio is the Palazzo dei Diamanti, which derives its name from its unique facade, adorned with characteristic pointed stonework that creates a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. The corner facing the crossroads features ornately decorated slabs depicting candelabras and a projecting balcony. The architectural style of the surrounding buildings is less ostentatious. However, architects employed various elements such as large portals and corner pilasters to introduce subtle variations and visual interest within the overall urban fabric.
The urban layout implemented during the construction of the Erculean Addition garnered significant recognition for its innovative and enduring qualities. When compared to other Italian and European cities of the period, Ferrara's urban fabric presented a distinct character. Unlike many contemporary urban centers, Ferrara lacked a clear spatial segregation between the areas controlled by the ruling class and those inhabited by the general population. This absence of a rigidly defined social hierarchy within the urban layout stands in contrast to cities like Mantua or Pienza, where a clear division between dominant and subordinate spaces existed. Ferrara's approach instead emphasized a harmonious integration of these sectors, allowing each to retain its own distinctive character. While the full development of the Erculean Addition may have been envisioned for a later stage, factors such as limited population growth and a dynastic shift ultimately halted its complete realization. Despite this, the innovative and well-organized nature of the initial design has proven remarkably adaptable. Over the centuries, this new area of the city has successfully accommodated various urban changes, ensuring its continued relevance.

Modern sculpture,"Modern sculpture is generally considered to have begun with the work of Auguste Rodin, who is seen as the progenitor of modern sculpture. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works. He ""dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void"". Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like Edgar Degas and Paul Gauguin, Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, ""arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century"".
Modernist sculpture movements include Art Nouveau, Cubism, Geometric abstraction, De Stijl, Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Formalism Abstract expressionism, Pop-Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Land art, Conceptual art, and Installation art among others.


== Modernism ==

The modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the Rodin exhibit at the Universal Exhibition held in Paris in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his Burghers of Calais, Balzac, Victor Hugo statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his Gates of Hell which included The Thinker.
Cubist sculpture, in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with cubist painting, and the formal experiments of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using collage, sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze Head of a Woman as the first cubist sculpture. 

Artists like Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and Alexander Archipenko, who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 Walking Woman were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead. Joseph Csaky, a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and Ossip Zadkine and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.
In the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, Pablo Picasso revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his constructions fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the collage in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was construction a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of Surrealism led to things occasionally being described as ""sculpture"" that would not have been so previously, such as ""involuntary sculpture"" in several senses, including coulage. In later years Picasso became a prolific potter, leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of  ceramic art, with figures such as George E. Ohr and subsequently Peter Voulkos, Kenneth Price, and Robert Arneson. Marcel Duchamp originated the use of the ""found object"" (French: objet trouvé) or readymade with pieces such as Fountain (1917).
Similarly, the work of Constantin Brâncuși at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his Bird in Space series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture. In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.
Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as Gaston Lachaise, Sir Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, Joan Miró, Ásmundur Sveinsson, Julio González, Pablo Serrano, Jacques Lipchitz and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by Alexander Calder, Len Lye, Jean Tinguely, and Frederick Kiesler who were pioneers of Kinetic art.


== Post-1950s ==
Since the 1950s Modernist trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge, 50-foot (15 m)-high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.
In the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.
By the 1960s Abstract expressionism, Geometric abstraction and Minimalism, which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features,  predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of Sir Anthony Caro, as well as welded sculpture by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of John Chamberlain, and environmental installation scale works by Mark di Suvero. Other Minimalists and Postminimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, Ronald Bladen, Giacomo Benevelli, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Eva Hesse, Christo, Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, and others like John Safer who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line, led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: George Segal, Claes Oldenburg, Arman, Leonard Baskin, Ernest Trova, Marisol Escobar, Paul Thek, Manuel Neri and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were Robert Graham in a classic articulated style and Fernando Botero bringing his painting's ""oversized figures"" into monumental sculptures. Ceramic sculpture as practiced by Pablo Picasso, Peter Voulkos, Stephen De Staebler, Kenneth Price, and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.

=== Contemporary movements ===
Site specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Andy Goldsworthy, Walter De Maria, Richard Long, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey, and Christo and Jeanne-Claude-led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the ""land art in the American West"" group of projects. These land art or ""earth art"" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater). Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, and Bruce Nauman, among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.
Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Eduardo Paolozzi, Chryssa, Walter De Maria, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through video art, environment, light sculpture, and installation art in new ways.
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include One and Three Chairs, 1965, by Joseph Kosuth, and An Oak Tree, 1973, by Michael Craig-Martin, and those of Joseph Beuys and James Turrell among others.
Postmodern sculpture occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. Rosalind Krauss identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of Land art, Minimalist sculpture, and site-specific art into the category of ""sculpture"":

Site-Construction: the intersection of landscape and architecture
Axiomatic Structures: the combination of architecture and not-architecture
Marked sites: the combination of landscape and not-landscape
Sculpture: intersection of not-landscape and not-architecture

==== Contemporary genres ====
Modern sculpture is often created outdoors, as in environmental art and environmental sculpture, often in full view of spectators. Light sculpture and site-specific art also often make use of the environment. Site-specific artwork is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors Patricia Johanson, Dennis Oppenheim, Athena Tacha, and others. Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic Lucy Lippard. Land art, Earthworks, (Earth art) is an art movement that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of nature generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, soil, rocks, logs, branches, leaves, and water, as well as man made materials like Chain-link fencing, barbed wire, rope, rubber, glass, concrete, metal, asphalt, and mineral pigments. Ice sculpture is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. Kinetic sculptures are sculptures that are designed to move, which include mobiles. Snow sculptures are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to 15 feet (4.6 m) on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.
Sound sculptures take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. Art toys have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by Takashi Murakami and Kid Robot, designed by Michael Lau, or hand-made by Michael Leavitt.

Mahogany,"Mahogany is a hard tropical wood from the Americas. It was discovered by Europeans early in the 16th century (~1514). The wood comes from a tree, Swietenia mahagoni. The tree is native to southern Florida  and islands in the Caribbean including the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.
At first, mahogany was used by the Spanish and English to build ships. 
Mark Catesby's Natural History explains why: 
""[Mahogany] has properties for that use excelling oak, and all other wood, viz. durableness, resisting gunshots, and burying the shot without splintering"".
The second use for mahogany was to make furniture. The Spanish were first to do this, but in the 18th and early 19th century it was much used by English workshops. This period is called ""Age of Mahogany"". Also much furniture in mahogany was made in France and other European countries.
It has a few special characteristics that make mahogany a helpful wood. It is strong and durable but easy to bend so is especially helpful for carpenters. Mahogany trees, although endangered, grow very tall and are so may be cut into large sheets. Also, mahogany is resistant to stains.

Work of art,"A work of art, artwork, art piece, piece of art or art object is an artistic creation of aesthetic value. Except for ""work of art"", which may be used of any work regarded as art in its widest sense, including works from literature and music, these terms apply principally to tangible, physical forms of visual art: 

An example of fine art, such as a painting or sculpture.
Objects in the decorative arts or applied arts that have been designed for aesthetic appeal, as well as any functional purpose, such as a piece of jewellery, many ceramics and much folk art.
An object created for principally or entirely functional, religious or other non-aesthetic reasons which has come to be appreciated as art (often later, or by cultural outsiders).
A non-ephemeral photograph or film.
A work of installation art or conceptual art.
Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:

A fine work of architecture or landscape design
A production of live performance, such as theater, ballet, opera, performance art, musical concert and other performing arts, and other ephemeral, non-tangible creations.
This article is concerned with the terms and concepts as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as aural-music and written word-literature have similar issues and philosophies.  The term objet d'art is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical).  The term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career.


== Definition ==
A work of art in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent aesthetic function.  A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger art movement or artistic era, such as: a genre, aesthetic convention, culture, or regional-national distinction. It can also be seen as an item within an artist's ""body of work"" or oeuvre. The term is commonly used by museum and cultural heritage curators, the interested public, the art patron-private art collector community, and art galleries.
Physical objects that document immaterial or conceptual art works, but do not conform to artistic conventions, can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some Dada and Neo-Dada conceptual and readymade works have received later inclusion. Also, some architectural renderings and models of unbuilt projects, such as by Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Frank Gehry, are other examples.
The products of environmental design, depending on intention and execution, can be ""works of art"" and include: land art, site-specific art, architecture, gardens, landscape architecture, installation art, rock art, and megalithic monuments.
Legal definitions of ""work of art"" are used in copyright law; see Visual arts § United States of America copyright definition of visual art.


== History ==


== Theories ==
Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something. A prime example of this theory are the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp. Marcel Duchamp criticized the idea that the work of art must be a unique product of an artist's labour or skill through his ""readymades"": ""mass-produced, commercially available, often utilitarian objects"" to which he gave  titles, designating them as artwork only through these processes of choosing and naming.
Artist Michael Craig-Martin, creator of An Oak Tree, said of his work – ""It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual oak tree is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water.""


== Distinctions ==
Some art theorists and writers have long made a distinction between the physical qualities of an art object and its identity-status as an artwork.  For example, a painting by Rembrandt has a physical existence as an ""oil painting on canvas"" that is separate from its identity as a masterpiece ""work of art"" or the artist's magnum opus.  Many works of art are initially denied ""museum quality"" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the Impressionists and non-representational abstract artists are examples. Some, such as the readymades of Marcel Duchamp including his infamous urinal Fountain, are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.
Research suggests that presenting an artwork in a museum context can affect the perception of it.
There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between ""fine art"" objects made by ""artists""; and folk art, craft-work, or ""applied art"" objects made by ""first, second, or third-world"" designers, artisans and craftspeople. Contemporary and archeological indigenous art, industrial design items in limited or mass production, and places created by environmental designers and cultural landscapes, are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.

Variegated ebony,"Variegated ebony is a group of valuable hardwood varieties, generally obtained from several species in the genus Diospyros, related to genuine ebony. The wood has been used for furniture but also in carpentry, luthiery, and sculpture. 


== Coromandel wood ==
Coromandel or calamander is a valuable hardwood obtained from the species Diospyros quaesita, native to India and Sri Lanka. It is variegated with stripes of deep black and hazel-brown, and is very heavy and hard relative to most other woods. The name ""calamander"" comes from coromandel, referring to the Coromandel Coast in India from where it was first exported.
Although objects made of calamander are still extant, the trees from which the wood was obtained were logged to near-extinction, and those remaining are a protected vulnerable species. Calamander furniture is so expensive and prized that recycling it is an unlikely proposition.


== Macassar ebony ==

Macassar ebony is obtained from Diospyros celebica, endemic to the island of Sulawesi. It is named after the city of Makassar, involved in the export of this wood.
A substitute, Macassar ebony, has similar characteristics and to the untrained eye is nearly identical, though the colour lacks the depth seen in genuine calamander.

Flame maple,"Flame maple (tiger maple), also known as flamed maple, curly maple, ripple maple, fiddleback or tiger stripe, is a feature of maple in which the growth of the wood fibers is distorted in an undulating chatoyant pattern, producing wavy lines known as ""flames"". This effect is often mistakenly said to be part of the grain of the wood; it is more accurately called ""figure"", as the distortion is perpendicular to the grain direction. Prized for its beautiful appearance, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of fine furniture and musical instruments, such as violins, guitars, and bassoons.
During the westward expansion of early settlers and explorers into the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains, curly maple was often used for making the stocks used on Kentucky rifles.


== About the Wood ==

When wood from a tree with undulating grain is split, the wood splits along the undulations, so that the split log shows, and one can feel, the physical waviness.

When the wood is sawn flat, effectively cutting off the ""tops"" of the ""waves"", the result is an alternating pattern of end grain and flat grain. As end grain naturally absorbs more stain than flat grain, staining the sawn wood accentuates the striped pattern.

Spiral arm,"Spiral arms are a defining feature of spiral galaxies. They manifest as spiral-shaped regions of enhanced brightness within the galactic disc. Typically, spiral galaxies exhibit two or more spiral arms. The collective configuration of these arms is referred to as the spiral pattern or spiral structure of the galaxy.
The appearance of spiral sleeves is quite diverse. Grand design spiral galaxies exhibit a symmetrical and distinct pattern, comprising two spiral arms that extend throughout the galaxy. In contrast, the spiral structure of flocculent galaxies comprises numerous small fragments of arms that are not connected to each other. The appearance of spiral arms varies across the electromagnetic spectrum.
In addition to increased brightness, spiral arms are characterised by an increased concentration of interstellar gas and dust, bright stars and star clusters, active starburst, a bluer colour, and an enhanced magnetic field strength in galaxies. The contribution of spiral arms to the total galaxy luminosity can reach 40–50% for some galaxies. The characteristics of spiral arms are correlated with other properties of galaxies, for example, the twist angle of spiral arms is related to parameters such as the mass of the supermassive black hole at the centre and the contribution of the bulge to the total luminosity.
Two main theories have been proposed to explain the origin of spiral arms: the stochastic self-propagating star formation model and the density wave theory. These theories describe different variants of the spiral structure and do not exclude each other. In addition to these theories, there are other theories that can explain the appearance of spiral structure in some cases.
The spiral structure was first identified in 1850 by Lord Rosse in the galaxy M51. The nature of spiral structure in galaxies remained unresolved for a considerable period of time.


== General characteristics ==

Spiral arms are a defining feature of the structural composition of spiral galaxies, which are situated within discs and exhibit heightened brightness relative to their surrounding environment. Such structures take the form of spirals, which in unbarred galaxies usually originate from a region near the centre of the galaxy, whereas in barred galaxies they originate at the ends of the bar. The spiral arms do not extend over the entire radius of the disc and cease at the distance at which the disc can still be discerned. A galaxy typically comprises two or more spiral arms. The collective configuration of these arms within a galaxy is referred to as a spiral pattern or spiral structure.
Around two thirds of all massive galaxies are spiral galaxies. Spiral arms have been observed in galaxies at redshifts up to 
  
    
      
        z
        ≈
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle z\approx 1}
  
, and on occasion even at greater distances, which corresponds to a time when the age of the Universe was less than half of the present one. This suggests that the spiral structure is a long-lived phenomenon.
The spiral arms exhibit considerable variation in their appearance. In general, they are characterized by an increased concentration of gas and dust, active starburst, and a greater prevalence of star clusters, H II regions, and bright stars than in the remainder of the disk. While spiral arms are primarily identifiable due to their young stellar population, there also exists an increased concentration of old stars within them.

The appearance and expression of spiral branches in a galaxy may vary depending on the part of the electromagnetic spectrum in which it is observed. In the blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum, the spiral arms are well defined due to the presence of blue supergiants. In the red and near-infrared, older stars contribute more, which makes the spiral arms appear smoother, but less contrasted. Radiation from interstellar dust makes the spiral arms bright in the far infrared, while radiation from neutral hydrogen and molecules makes them bright at radio band. The greatest contrast and amount of fine detail in spiral arms can be seen when observed in emission spectral lines produced by emission nebulae, as well as in polyaromatic hydrocarbon lines produced by cold gas clouds.

The appearance of spiral arms is one of the criteria for galaxy morphological classification. For example, in Hubble's classification scheme, spiral galaxies are divided into types Sa, Sb, Sc. Barred spiral galaxies are divided into types SBa, SBb and SBc. The spiral arms of early type Sa and SBa galaxies are tightly wound and smooth, while those of late type Sc and SBc galaxies are knotty and loosely wound. Types Sb and SBb exhibit intermediate characteristics.

=== Morphology ===
The spiral structure of galaxies exhibits considerable diversity in appearance. Grand design spiral galaxies exhibit a symmetrical and clear pattern comprising two spiral arms that extend throughout the galaxy. They account for 10% of the total number of spiral galaxies. In contrast, the spiral structure of flocculent galaxies consists of numerous small fragments of arms that are not connected to each other. Among spiral galaxies, the fraction of such galaxies is equal to 30%.

The remainder of the galaxies are of an intermediate type, referred to as ""multi-armed"", which exhibit the proberties of both the flocculent and grand design galaxies. For example, they may appear to be grand design galaxies, yet possess more than two arms. Alternatively, they may exhibit a more ordered two-arm structure in the interior, which becomes irregular at the periphery. Nevertheless, in almost all cases, both types of structure are present in the spiral structure. Even grand design galaxies have details that do not fit into the spiral pattern. Additionally, there are galaxies that exhibit different types of spiral structure when observed across different spectral ranges. The distinction between the two main types of spiral arms appears to be related to fundamental physical differences between them.

Additionally, spiral arms are subdivided into two categories: massive and filamentary. In the first instance, the spiral arms are wide, diffuse, and do not contrast significantly with the space between them. In contrast, in the second instance, the spiral arms are narrow and clearly defined.

=== Shape and pitch angle ===

The shape of the arm is usually parameterised by the pitch angle 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  
. The pitch angle is the angle between the tangent to spiral arm at a given point and the perpendicular to the radius drawn to that point. In the majority of spiral galaxies, the average pitch angle lies within the range of 5° to 30°. Spiral arms with a small pitch angle are called tightly wound, while those with a larger pitch angle are called open.

The shape of spiral arms is often described in a simplified manner as a logarithmic spiral. However, spiral arms may also be described as an Archimedean or hyperbolic spiral. In the case of the logarithmic spiral, the pitch angle is constant. It decreases with increasing distance from the centre in the Archimedean spiral and increases in the hyperbolic spiral. The measurements of twist angles in galaxies indicate that only a minority of spiral galaxies have pitch angles of the arms that are close to constant. More than two-thirds of galaxies have pitch angles that vary by more than 20%. The average twist angle is found to correlate with a number of different galaxy parameters. For example, the spiral arms of galaxies with brighter bulges tend to be wound tighter.
	Several galaxies for which measurements of the pitch angle were made, SDSS images (the obtained values of 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  
 are given in brackets)
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

Spiral arms may additionally be categorized as either trailing or leading. In the case of trailing spiral arms, their outer tips point in the direction opposite to the direction of galaxy rotation. In the case of leading arms, their outer tips point in the same direction in which the galaxy rotates. In practice, it is challenging to ascertain whether the arms of a given galaxy are leading or trailing. To observe the spiral structure, the galaxy should not be tilted excessively towards the picture plane. However, a slight tilt is necessary to determine the direction of rotation. Additionally, the side of the galaxy closer to the observer needs to be identified. A review of the observational data indicates that the majority of galaxies exhibit trailing spiral arms, with leading arms being relatively uncommon. For instance, among the two hundred galaxies studied in this manner, only two may have leading arms. In some instances, galaxies exhibit both leading and trailing spiral arms, as exemplified by NGC 4622. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that leading spiral arms can emerge in specific circumstances. One such instance is when the dark matter halo rotates in opposition to the galaxy disk.
The width of spiral arms in the majority of galaxies increases with increasing distance from the centre. Grand design galaxies exhibit the greatest width of spiral arms.


=== Luminosity and colour ===

The ratio of the luminosity of the spiral structure to the luminosity of the entire galaxy is greatest for grand design spiral galaxies. For these galaxies, this ratio is 21% on average, with some reaching as high as 40-50%. For flocculent and multi-arm galaxies, the ratio is 13% and 14%, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of spiral arms in the total luminosity increases in later morphological types. For Sa-type galaxies, this proportion averages 13%, while for Sc-type galaxies it averages 30%.
The colour of the spiral arms becomes increasingly blue for galaxies of late morphological types. The colour index g-r for Sc-type galaxies is approximately 0.3-0.4m, while for Sa-type galaxies it is 0.5-0.6m.
Additionally, there are anemic galaxies (anemic spirals). These galaxies are distinguished by a diffuse, faint spiral pattern, which is attributed to a reduced quantity of gas and, consequently, a diminished star formation rate in comparison to normal spiral galaxies of the same morphological type. Anemic galaxies are more prevalent in galaxy clusters. Apparently, the galaxies in these clusters are subject to ram pressure, which results in the rapid loss of gas. It is hypothesized that this type of galaxy may be in-between spiral and lenticular galaxies.


=== Magnetic field ===
Stronger magnetic fields are observed in the spiral arms than in the remainder of the galaxy. The average value of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies is 10 microgauss, while in their spiral arms it is 25 microgauss. In galaxies with a pronounced spiral pattern, the magnetic fields are orientated along the arms. However, in some cases, the magnetic field may form a separate spiral structure that runs in the space between the visible spiral arms. Conversely, magnetic fields can influence the movement of gas within the galaxy and contribute to the formation of spiral arms. However, they are insufficiently strong to play a dominant role in the formation of spiral arms.


=== Correlation between spiral arm parameters and other galaxy properties ===
The parameters of spiral arms correlate with other galaxy properties. For instance, it is established that galaxies with a greater pitch angle typically exhibit a lower mass of the supermassive black hole at their centre and a smaller galaxy mass in general. Additionally, their bulge contributes less to the total luminosity, they have a lower velocity dispersion in the centre, and their rotation curves appear to be more increasing. However, these dependencies are not particularly pronounced. Although the pitch angle of the spiral arms was originally introduced into the galaxy morphological classification as one of the classification criteria, subsequent analysis has revealed that this value correlates with the morphological type to a lesser extent than, for example, the indicator of the colour of the spiral arms. The correlation between the pitch angle and the aforementioned parameters can be theoretically explained. The described quantities are related to the mass distribution within the galaxy, which affects the manner in which the density wave propagates within the galaxy disc.
In more massive galaxies with a more ordered structure, spiral arms are observed to be more pronounced and contrasting. Additionally, the contrast between spiral arms is more pronounced in galaxies with a pronounced bar, although this correlation is relatively weak. In general, flocculent galaxies have a lower mass and a later morphological type than grand design galaxies.


== Spiral structure of the Milky Way ==

It is challenging to ascertain the presence of spiral arms in the disc of our galaxy through optical observation, given that the Sun is situated within the plane of the Milky Way disc, and the light is being absorbed by interstellar dust. Nevertheless, spiral arms can be observed, for instance, when mapping the distribution of neutral hydrogen or molecular clouds.
The precise location, length, and number of spiral arms remain uncertain. However, the prevailing view is that the Milky Way contains four major spiral arms: two main ones - the Scutum-Centaurus and Perseus arms, and two secondary ones - the Norma and Sagittarius arms. Their pitch angle is approximately 12°, and their width is estimated at 800 parsecs. In addition to the large arms, smaller, similar formations, such as the Orion arm, are also distinguished.


== Theories on the spiral structure origin ==
The prevalence of spiral galaxies indicates that spiral structure is a long-lived phenomenon. However, since galaxies themselves rotate differentially rather than as solid bodies, any structure in the disc should curve significantly and disappear in approximately one to two revolutions. The two most prevalent solutions to this issue are the stochastic self-propagating star formation model (SSPSF) and the density wave theory, which describe disparate variants of the spiral structure. The first explanation posits that spiral arms are perpetually forming and dissipating without sufficient time to undergo significant twisting – such spiral arms are designated as material arms. The density wave theory posits that the spiral pattern is a density wave, thereby rotating independently of the disc as a solid body. Consequently, spiral arms are designated as wave arms. It is possible for these types of spiral arms to occur simultaneously within the same galaxy.
Tidal tails observed in interacting galaxies are also considered material spiral arms. Due to the low velocity of matter at a distance from the galaxy, tidal tails appear to persist for an extended period of time.


=== SSPSF model ===

The SSPSF model posits that spiral arms emerge when starburst becomes active within a region of the galaxy. The presence of young, bright stars in this region has the effect of influencing the surrounding interstellar medium. For instance, a supernova explosion generates a shockwave in the gas, thereby facilitating the spread of star formation across the galactic disk. In a period of less than 100 million years, the brightest stars in this region have time to extinguish. This is less than the time required for one revolution of the galaxy. The differential rotation of this region allows it to stretch into a short arc. Given that starburst is a continuous process occurring in different regions of the disc, there are numerous such arcs at different times throughout the disc, which can be observed as a flocculent spiral pattern. Given that such spiral arms are only visible due to young stars, they have a minimal impact on the mass distribution within the galaxy and are rarely observed in the infrared.


=== Density wave theory ===

In the context of density wave theory, spiral arms are understood to emerge when mechanical oscillations occur within a disc, giving rise to a density wave - the stars move within the disc in such a way that they converge in specific regions and become more concentrated. The density wave exerts a governing influence not only on the stars but also on the gas, thereby promoting a more active starburst in regions where the concentration of stars is higher. Concurrently, at various points in time, different stars emerge within the spiral arm, resulting in the density wave moving at a different speed than the stellar disc. Consequently, the density wave is not subject to twisting. The influence of this mechanism results in the formation of a large-scale, ordered spiral structure, which is also observed in the infrared. The concentration of stars in the spiral arm increases by a mere 10-20%, yet this relatively modest change in gravitational potential has a profound impact on the gas dynamics. The gas accelerates, and shock waves can occur in it, appearing as dark dust lanes in the arms.
It is challenging to confirm the presence of a density wave in practice. However, it is possible to do so, for instance, by detecting a specific corotation radius, which is a region where the spiral arm moves at the same speed as the stars. It can be identified by observing colour gradients within the arms. Since the stellar population forms within an arm and subsequently reddens over time, a colour gradient should be observed across the arm if its velocity differs from that of the arm. It is hypothesised that density waves are created and maintained by the bars of galaxies or by tidal force of their satellites.

The density wave theory postulates that only trailing spiral arms are stable, and that any leading structure must at some point transition into a trailing one. Concurrently, the structure itself is amplified for a period following the transformation, which is called swing amplification.

=== Alternative theories ===
Some theories propose alternative mechanisms for the appearance of spiral arms that differ from the density wave theory and the SSPSF model. These theories are not intended to replace the aforementioned theories entirely, but rather to explain the appearance of spiral arms in specific cases. For instance, the manifold theory is applicable only to barred spiral galaxies. According to this theory, the gravitational influence of the bar causes the orbits of the stars to be arranged in a certain way, creating spiral arms and moving along them. The name of the theory is related to the fact that in this model the stars moving in spiral arms form a manifold in phase space. In contrast to the density wave theory, the manifold theory does not posit the emergence of colour gradients in spiral arms, which are in fact observed in numerous galaxies. The fact that in galaxies with a bar, spiral arms originate from a region proximate to the bar may suggest a correlation between these structures and the manifold theory. However, this is not the sole theory that explains the genesis of arms due to bars.


== Research history ==

The spiral arms were first discovered in the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51), in which Lord Rosse identified the spiral structure in 1850.
In 1896, the problem of twisting was formulated. If spiral arms were material entities, due to differential rotation, they would twist very rapidly to the point where they would be impossible to observe. Consequently, the question of the nature of the spiral structure remained unresolved for a considerable period of time. Since 1927, this question has been addressed by Bertil Lindblad, who in 1961 correctly concluded that the spiral arms arise due to gravitational interaction between the stars in the disc. Subsequently, in 1964, Chia-Chiao Lin and Frank Shu proposed the theory that spiral arms can be conceptualised as density waves. The SSPSF model was first proposed in 1978, although the concept of a supernova explosion stimulating starburst in neighbouring regions was first proposed by Ernst Opik as early as 1953. This observation formed the basis of the subsequent theory.
In 1953, the distances to the various stellar associations in our galaxy were measured with a high degree of accuracy. This enabled the discovery of a spiral structure in the Milky Way.
The classification of galaxies into flocculent, multi-armed, and grand design categories is derived from a more complex morphological classification scheme involving 10 classes that describe the type of spiral pattern. The classification scheme was developed by Debra and Bruce Elmegreen in 1987. Subsequently, they proposed a simplified scheme, which is the one that is currently in use.
Despite the considerable successes of the density wave theory, the physical nature of spiral arms remains a topic of debate, with no clear consensus yet reached.

Software engineering,"Software engineering is a field of engineering, for designing and writing programs for computers or other electronic devices.  A software engineer, or programmer, writes software and compiles the software to make instructions the computer can follow. 
Good quality software is easier to fix and add new features. Good documentation and good design are parts of good software. Becoming a software engineer requires experience and practice writing code. Software engineering may be very difficult work.   The software release life cycle includes getting the requirements, planning, writing, documenting and testing the software before it is released. When it is released, it is given to other people to use, who are called the ""end users"". Good software should be user friendly, which means it is easy to use.


== Steps in creating software ==
Software engineering can broadly be split into the following steps:

Requirements say what the software should do.
Software design is usually done on paper. It says what the different parts of the software are, and how they talk to each other.
After the design phase is done, each component (part) of the software is coded.  Code is what tells the computer exactly what to do at each step.
Testing is done to see if the components meet the requirements and that the system as a whole meet the requirements.
Part or all of this process can be repeated if software bugs are found or new requirements are needed.


== Tools used in creating software ==
Software engineers use many tools and practices in making software.  Some of the most common are:

Flowcharts
UML diagram
Debugging tools
Compiler
Text editor, usually part of an IDE - Integrated Development Environment
Database

Hardwood,"Hardwood is wood from angiosperm trees. These are usually found in broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests. In temperate and boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduous, but in tropics and subtropics mostly evergreen. Hardwood (which comes from angiosperm trees) contrasts with softwood (which is from gymnosperm trees).


== Characteristics ==

Hardwoods are produced by angiosperm trees that reproduce by flowers, and have broad leaves. Many species are deciduous. Those of temperate regions lose their leaves every autumn as temperatures fall and are dormant in the winter, but those of tropical regions may shed their leaves in response to seasonal or sporadic periods of drought.  Hardwood from deciduous species, such as oak, normally shows annual growth rings, but these may be absent in some tropical hardwoods.
Hardwoods have a more complex structure than softwoods and are often much slower growing as a result. The dominant feature separating ""hardwoods"" from softwoods is the presence of pores, or vessels. The vessels may show considerable variation in size, shape of perforation plates (simple, scalariform, reticulate, foraminate), and structure of cell wall, such as spiral thickenings.
As the name suggests, the wood from these trees is generally harder than that of softwoods, but there are significant exceptions.  In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, with the range in density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods; some hardwoods (e.g., balsa) are softer than most softwoods, while yew is an example of a hard softwood.


== Chemistry ==
The structural polymers of hardwoods are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The constituents of hardwood lignin differs from those included in softwood. Sinapyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol are the main monomers of hardwood lignin.
Hardwoods contain less amount of non-structural constituents, named extractives, than softwoods. These extractives are usually categorized into three broad groups: aliphatic compounds, terpenes and phenolic compounds. Aliphatic compounds found in hardwoods include fatty acids, fatty alcohols and their esters with glycerol, fatty alcohols (waxes) and sterols (steryl esters), hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, sterols, such as sitosterol, sitostanol and campesterol. The terpene content of the hardwood significantly differs from the softwood, and mainly consists of triterpenoids, polyprenols and other higher terpenes. Triterpenoids commonly purified from hardwoods include cycloartenol, betulin and squalene. Hardwood polyterpenes are rubber, gutta percha, gutta-balatá and betulaprenols. Although in small quantities, hardwoods also contain mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes, such as α- and β-pinenes, 3-carene, β-myrcene, limonene, hinokitiol, δ-cadinene, α- and δ-cadinols, borneol. Hardwood is rich in phenolic compounds, such as stilbenes, lignans, norlignans, tannins, flavonoids.


== Applications ==
Hardwoods are employed in a large range of applications, including fuel, tools, construction, boat building, furniture making, musical instruments, flooring, cooking, barrels, and manufacture of charcoal. Solid hardwood joinery tends to be expensive compared to softwood. In the past, tropical hardwoods were easily available, but the supply of some species, such as Burma teak and mahogany, is now becoming scarce due to over-exploitation. Cheaper ""hardwood"" doors, for instance, now consist of a thin veneer bonded to a core of softwood, plywood or medium-density fibreboard (MDF). Hardwoods may be used in a variety of objects, but are most frequently seen in furniture or musical instruments because of their density which adds to durability, appearance, and performance. Different species of hardwood lend themselves to different end uses or construction processes. This is due to the variety of characteristics apparent in different timbers, including density, grain, pore size, growth and fibre pattern, flexibility and ability to be steam bent. For example, the interlocked grain of elm wood (Ulmus spp.) makes it suitable for the making of chair seats where the driving in of legs and other components can cause splitting in other woods.


=== Cooking ===
There is a correlation between density and calories/volume. This makes the denser hardwoods like oak, cherry, and apple more suited for camp fires, cooking fires, and smoking meat, as they tend to burn hotter and longer than softwoods like pine or cedar whose low-density construction and highly-flammable pitch make them burn quickly and without producing quite as much heat.

Crayola,"Crayola is an American brand of crayons and other writing and drawing utensils, such as markers, chalk and colored pencils. The company used to be called ""Binney & Smith Company"". It is based in Northampton, Massachusetts. Since 1984, it has been owned by the company Hallmark Cards.


== Colors ==

Crayola is brand of crayons and other writing and drawing utensils, such as markers, chalk and colored pencils made by the Binney & Smith Inc. company, which is part of the card company Hallmark.


== History ==
Binney and Smith made industrial products before 1900, but in 1903 started to make Crayola crayons. The name came from a word used by the wife of Mr. Binney. The first box had eight colors: blue, green, red, yellow, black, brown, orange and violet. They became well known because they were the best crayons at that time. Later, the company made more products, including boxes of 48, 64, 96, 120 and 200 Crayons, colored pencils and markers.


== Colors ==


=== Colored pencils ===
The following is a list of colors included in the 12, 24, 36, 50 and 64 packs of Crayola's standard colored pencils. Color values are approximate. Colored Pencils from ""Guppie Green"" to ""UFO Green"" are 14 of the ultra-cool and super-hot colored pencils that were issued in July 2010.
The following is a complete list of colors included in the 12, 24, 36, 50, 60, and 100 packs of Crayola's standard colored pencils. Color values are approximate.

The year of the introduction of the 12, 24, 36, 50, 60, and 100 packs of colored pencils is unknown.
The current 100 pack has the 60 pack colors with 40 colors doubled, but 100 packs produced in 2014 or earlier include the 45 additional colors, but 5 colors are removed: Gold, Silver, Metallic Blue, Metallic Bronze, and Metallic Copper.


=== Markers ===
98 colors are on this list, there may be a few missing, but the list is mostly complete. Just like with the crayons, some colors have since been retired.

Voluntarism (philosophy),"Voluntarism is ""any metaphysical or psychological system that assigns to the will (Latin: voluntas) a more predominant role than that attributed to the intellect"", or equivalently ""the doctrine that will is the basic factor, both in the universe and in human conduct"". Voluntarism has appeared at various points throughout the history of philosophy, seeing application in the areas of metaphysics, psychology, political philosophy and theology.
The term voluntarism was introduced by Ferdinand Tönnies into the philosophical literature and particularly used by Wilhelm Wundt and Friedrich Paulsen.


== Theological voluntarism ==


=== Medieval theological voluntarism ===
Associated with Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (two of the foremost medieval scholastic philosophers), medieval theological voluntarism (not to be confused with meta-ethical theological voluntarism) is generally taken to be the philosophical emphasis on the divine will and human freedom over and above the intellect (voluntas superior intellectu). For example, Scotus held that morality comes from God's will and choice rather than his intellect or knowledge. Accordingly, God should be defined as an omnipotent being whose actions should not and cannot be ultimately rationalized and explained through reason. As such, voluntarism is usually contrasted with intellectualism, championed by the scholastic Thomas Aquinas.


=== Theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy ===
Theological voluntarism also refers to theological commitments—that is, specific interpretations of doctrines of Christianity—arguably held by certain early modern natural philosophers such as Pierre Gassendi, Walter Charleton, Robert Boyle, Isaac Barrow and Isaac Newton. It resulted in an empirical approach associated with early modern science.  Voluntarism therefore allows that faith or belief in God can be achieved by will as opposed to requiring a prior divine gift of faith to the individual. This notion holds at least in so far as it has found favor among some historians and philosophers (e.g. the historian Francis Oakley and the philosopher Michael B. Foster). A 20th-century theologian of voluntarism was James Luther Adams.


== Metaphysical voluntarism ==
A proponent of metaphysical voluntarism is 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In his view, the will is not reasoning, but an irrational, unconscious urge in relation to which the intellect represents a secondary phenomenon. The will is actually the force at the core of all reality. This putting out of the drive–intention–vital dynamics later influenced Friedrich Nietzsche (will to power), Philipp Mainländer (will to die), Eduard von Hartmann, Julius Bahnsen and Sigmund Freud (will to pleasure).


== Epistemological voluntarism ==
In epistemology, epistemological voluntarism is the view that belief is a matter of the will rather than one of simply registering one's cognitive attitude or degree of psychological certainty with respect to a stated proposition. If one is a voluntarist with respect to beliefs, it is coherent to simultaneously feel very certain about a particular proposition P and assign P a very low subjective probability. This is the basis of Bas van Fraassen's reflection principle. See also: Doxastic voluntarism.


== Political voluntarism ==
Political voluntarism, or voluntaryism, is the view that understands political authority to be will-based. This view which was propounded by theorists like Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and many members of the German idealist tradition understands political authority as emanating from a will.


== Marxist context ==
In Marxist discourse, voluntarism was used to designate a connection between a philosophical commitment to metaphysical voluntarism (especially Machism) and a political commitment to extreme revolutionary tactics, particularly associated with Alexander Bogdanov.
The Soviet Union promoted shock work during the First Five-Year Plan period in an effort to increase productivity through human effort in the absence of more developed machinery.: 57 
The Cuban Revolutionary Offensive sought to encourage voluntary labor in the countryside both to accelerate development of the socialist economy and to encourage the development of the socialist New Man ethos.: 37–38 


== Critical voluntarism ==
Hugo Dingler's critical voluntarism in the philosophy of science is a form of conventionalism which posits that theorizing in the sciences starts with an unavoidable free decision of the will. The successor school of Dingler's critical voluntarism is the  methodical constructivism of the Erlangen School (cf. also the methodical culturalism of the Marburg School).

Software incompatibility,"Software incompatibility is a characteristic of software components or systems which cannot operate satisfactorily together on the same computer, or on different computers linked by a computer network. They may be components or systems which are intended to operate cooperatively or independently. Software compatibility is a characteristic of software components or systems which can operate satisfactorily together on the same computer, or on different computers linked by a computer network. It is possible that some software components or systems may be compatible in one environment and incompatible in another.


== Examples ==


=== Deadlocks ===
Consider sequential programs of the form:

Request resource A
Request resource B
Perform action using A and B
Release resource B
Release resource A

A particular program might use a printer (resource A) and a file (resource B) in order to print the file.
If several such programs P1,P2,P3 ... operate at the same time, then the first one to execute will block the others until the resources are released, and the programs will execute in turn. There will be no problem. It makes no difference whether a uni-processor or a multi-processor system is used, as it's the allocation of the resources which determines the order of execution.
Note, however, that programmers are, in general, not constrained to write programs in a particular way, or even if there are guidelines, then some may differ from the guidelines. A variant of the previous program may be:

Request resource B
Request resource A
Perform action using A and B
Release resource A
Release resource B

The resources A and B are the same as in the previous example – not simply dummy variables, as otherwise the programs are identical.
As before, if there are several such programs, Q1,Q2,Q3 which run at the same time using resources as before, there will be no problem.
However, if several of the Ps are set to run at the same time as several of the Qs, then a deadlock condition can arise. Note that the deadlock need not arise, but may.

P: Request resource A
Q: Request resource B
Q: Request resource A (blocked by P)
P: Request resource B (blocked by Q)
...

Now neither P nor Q can proceed1.
This is one kind of example where programs may demonstrate incompatibility.


=== Interface incompatibility ===
Another example of a different kind would be where one software component provides service to another. The incompatibility could be as simple as a change in the order of parameters between the software component requesting service, and the component providing the service. This would be a kind of interface incompatibility. This might be considered a bug, but could be very hard to detect in some systems. Some interface incompatibilities can easily be detected during the build stage, particularly for strongly typed systems, others may be hard to find and may only be detected at run time, while others may be almost impossible to detect without a detailed program analysis.
Consider the following example:

 Component P calls component Q with parameters x and y. For this example, y may be an integer.

 Q returns f(x) which is desired and never zero, and ignores y.

A variant of Q, Q' has similar behaviour, with the following differences:

 if y = 100, then Q' does not terminate.

If P never calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q' instead is a compatible computation.
However if P calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q' instead will lead to a non-terminating computation. 
If we assume further that f(x) has a numeric value, then component Q'' defined as:

 Q'' behaves as Q except that
 if y = 100 then Q'' does not terminate
 if y = 101 then Q'' returns 0.9 * f(x)
 if y = 102 then Q'' returns a random value
 if y = 103 then Q'' returns 0.

may cause problem behaviour. If P now calls Q'' with  = 101, then the results of the computation will be incorrect, but may not cause a program failure. If P calls Q'' with y = 102 then the results are unpredictable, and failure may arise, possibly due to divide by zero or other errors such as arithmetic overflow.
If P calls Q'' with y= 103 then in the event that P uses the result in a division operation, then a divide by zero failure may occur.
This example shows how one program P1 may be always compatible with another Q1, but that there can be constructed other programs Q1' and Q1'' such that P1 and Q1' are sometimes incompatible, and P1 and Q1'' are always incompatible.


=== Performance incompatibility ===
Sometimes programs P and Q can be running on the same computer, and the presence of one will inhibit the performance of the other. This can particularly happen where the computer uses virtual memory. The result may be that disk thrashing occurs, and one or both programs will have significantly reduced performance. This form of incompatibility can occur if P and Q are intended to cooperate, but can also occur if P and Q are completely unrelated but just happen to run at the same time. An example might be if P is a program which produces large output files, which happen to be stored in main memory, and Q is an anti-virus program which scans many files on the hard disk. If a memory cache is used for virtual memory, then it is possible for the two programs to interact adversely and the performance of each will be drastically reduced.
For some programs P and Q their performance compatibility may depend on the environment in which they are run. They may be substantially incompatible if they are run on a computer with limited main memory, yet it may be possible to run them satisfactorily on a machine with more memory. Some programs may be performance incompatible in almost any environment.

Ignition Component,"The Ignition Component (IC) is a number which relates the probability that a fire will result if a firebrand is introduced into a fine fuel complex. It is a component of the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS).


== Meaning ==
The ignition component can range from 0 when conditions are cool and damp, to 100 on days when the weather is dry and windy.
Theoretically, on a day when the ignition component value is 0 a single firebrand will not start a Wildland fire requiring suppression action. A value of 50, there is a 50% probability a single firebrand could start a wildfire requiring suppression action. And when the value is 100, there is a 100% probability a wildfire will result from a single firebrand that will require suppression action to stop the fire from spreading in wildland fuels.
In relation to fire danger, IC of 100 means that every firebrand will cause an actionable fire if it contacts receptive fuel, extreme. Likewise, IC of 0 no firebrand would cause an actionable fire under those conditions, low fire danger.

Barrier-grid animation and stereography,"Barrier-grid animation or picket-fence animation is an animation effect created by moving a striped transparent overlay across an interlaced image. The barrier-grid technique originated in the late 1890s, overlapping with the development of parallax stereography (Relièphographie) for 3D autostereograms. The technique has also been used for color-changing pictures, but to a much lesser extent.
The development of barrier-grid technologies can also be regarded as a step towards lenticular printing, although the technique has remained after the invention of lenticular technologies as a relatively cheap and simple way to produce animated images in print.


== Concept ==
The barrier-grid technique uses a grid of barriers to control images reaching the viewer's eyes. The grid consists of a series of vertical or horizontal strips that can be either opaque or transparent. Typically, the barriers (opaque strips) alternate with transparent regions. 


=== Animation ===
In barrier-grid animation, several images are cut into strips and interleaved. The barrier grid allows the strips from one of the interleaved images to be seen at a time. Movement of the grid relative to the interleaved image causes the viewer to see each of the images in succession.


=== Stereography ===
In parallax stereography, a barrier grid is placed in front of an image or a screen, with the distance between the grid and the image chosen such that the strips of image visible to each eye do not overlap. The images presented to each eye are slightly different, and are constructed such that the brain can combine them to create the illusion of depth via stereopsis. This allows viewing of 3D images without the need for specialized glasses, making it a practical and convenient solution for a wide range of applications.


== History ==

Using screens for photographic printing was suggested by William Fox Talbot as ""photographic screens or veils"" in an 1852 patent. This resulted in several halftone processes in the next decades. For color photography the use of colored line sheets had been suggested by Louis Arthur Ducos du Hauron in 1869. Several halftone printing and color photography processes, including the 1895 Joly colour screen with >0.1 mm RGB lines, inspired the use of line screens for autostereoscopic images.


=== Motograph ===
W. Symons received British Patent No. 5,759 on March 14, 1896 for a technique that was used about two years later for the oldest known publication that used a line-sheet to create the illusion of motion in pictures.
The Motograph Moving Picture Book was published in London at the start of 1898 by Bliss, Sands & Co. It came with a ""transparency"" with black stripes to add the illusion of motion to the pictures in the book (13 in the original black and white edition and 23 in the later color edition). The illustrations were credited to ""F.J. Vernay, Yorick, &c."".
The pictures feature different hatching patterns, causing moiré type effects when the striped transparency is moved across it. It creates a vibrant type of motion illusion with revolving wheels, billowing smoke, ripples in water, etc.
The expanded ""new edition"" of the book had a cover design ""specially drawn for the book"" by famous French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, depicting a woman viewing pictures with the transparency (accompanied by a girl, a man and three different pets).


=== Auguste Berthier's autostereograms ===

In May 1896 Auguste Berthier published an article about the history of stereoscopic images in French scientific magazine Le Cosmos, which included his method of creating an  autostereogram. Alternating strips from the left and right image of a traditional stereoscopic negative had to be recomposed as an interlaced image, preferably during the printing of the image on paper. A glass plate with opaque lines had to be fixed in front of the interlaced print with a few millimeters in between, so the lines on the screen formed a parallax barrier: from the right distance and angle each eye could only see the photographic strips shot from the corresponding angle. The article was illustrated with a diagram of the principle, an image of the two parts of a stereoscopic photograph divided into exaggerated wide bands, and the same strips recomposed as an interlaced image. Berthier's idea was hardly noticed. After Frederic Ives' similar autostereograms were presented at the French Academy of Sciences in 1904, Berthier reminded the institute about his autostereograms that he in the meantime had also managed to create in color.


=== Frederic Ives' parallax stereogram & changeable picture ===
On December 5, 1901 American inventor Frederic Eugene Ives presented his ""parallax stereogram"" at the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania. He claimed that he first had the idea 16 years earlier while working with the line screen in a study of ""the dioptrics of half-tone screen photography"". At the time he didn't think it was important enough to spend his time on. In 1901 Ives realized that he could easily adapt his Kromolinoskop color photo camera to create the stereogram and thought it would be an interesting scientific novelty worthy of presentation at the Franklin Institute. The ""parallax stereogram"" was a photo shot through two apertures behind the lens with a ""transparent-line screen, consisting of opaque lines with clear spaces between them"" in front of the sensitive plate, slightly separated from it. The line screen had 200 parallel lines per inch (79/cm) and was contact-printed from an original factory halftone screen. The technique received U.S. patent 725,567 on April 14, 1903 (application filed on September 25, 1902).
On October 11, 1904 Ives received U.S. patent 771,824 (application filed on October 27, 1903) for a ""Changeable sign, picture, &c."". This was basically the same technique but with interlaced different images instead of a stereoscopic image. Shifting from one angle to the other, by passing the image or by a vibration of the image, the image would change from one to the other.


=== Eugène Estanave's animated autostereograms ===
In 1904 Léon Gaumont came across Ives' pictures at the World's Fair in St. Louis and had them presented at the French Academy of Sciences in October and the Société Française de Physique in November. Gaumont gave two parallax stereograms to the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers in 1905 and two others became part of the collection of the Société française de photographie.
French mathematician Eugène Estanave was encouraged by Gaumont to investigate the parallax stereogram and started working with the technique late in 1905. On January 24, 1906, Estanave filed for French patent 371.487 for a stereophotography device and stereoscopy using line sheets. It included his ""changing"" pictures that applied the principle of Ives' ""Changeable sign"" to animated photography, for instance the portrait of a woman with eyes open or closed depending on the viewing angle. On February 3, 1910 he requested an addition to his patent to include animated stereoscopic photography. This system used line sheets with vertical and horizontal lines, and combined four images: two stereoscopic pairs of two different moments. August 1, 1908 Estanave was granted French patent N° 392871 for an autostereoscopic photographic plate. This plate was exposed and developed to create a positive stereoscopic image, avoiding the trouble of aligning the interlaced photograph with a line screen. In the same year he was awarded a special prize at the French Academy of Sciences by Gabriel Lippmann for an x-ray stereogram. In 1911 Estanave discovered another variation: the Joly colour screen (with lines in three colors) could be adapted to create color photographs with the hues shifting when the viewing angle was changed. Fifteen examples of Estanave's stereograms are known to have survived. He seems not have commercialized any of his methods. Others marketed very similar animated portraits, usually with plastic line sheets, with some success in the 1910s and 1920s.

Magic moving pictures were composed of images containing black vertical and regularly interlaced stripes, alternating between two or three phases of a depicted motion or between distinctly different pictures. A little transparent sheet with regular vertical black stripes was glued beneath a window in a cardboard envelope holding the picture card. The card was pulled out and pushed back in to produce the illusion of change or motion.
The technique was patented in the United States on August 28, 1906, by Alexander S. Spiegel as a nameless ""display device"" (application date November 29, 1905). Spiegel patented several improvements, the last in 1911. Initially the pictures were drawings; later photographs were used. The postcards were marketed under Spiegel's patent as Magic moving pictures by G. Felsenthal & Co and as Magic moving picture card by the Franklin Postcard Company, both from Chicago. The latter produced a card in 1912 which enabled the viewer to choose among the portraits of three presidential candidates during that year's U.S. presidential election.
Similar cards have been published in Japan around 1920 as Cinematograph by SK and in France around 1940 as Mon cinema chez moi.


=== Ombro-Cinéma ===

Ombro-Cinéma toys operated on rotating scrolls of paper with sequences of images printed as interlaced two-frame animations: thin regularly-spaced vertical stripes of one frame of the animation were alternated with stripes of the next frame, alternately hidden by regularly-spaced black vertical stripes on a transparent viewing pane. In some versions the stripes on the viewing pane were disguised as a picket fence. Ombro-Cinema toys had of a wooden or cardboard chassis with a rack and hand-crank for cycling the image scroll across the viewing pane. In some versions a wind-up clockwork mechanism transferred the scroll while operating a music box.
The Ombro-Cinéma toy was produced by Saussine Ed. in Paris and patented in 1921 and six months later received a gold medal at the 19th Concours Lépine. Saussine had previously published versions with regular non-animated silhouettes on the scroll, as Ombres Chinoises (Chinese Shadows), patented in 1897. Both toys were named after and inspired by the Ombres Chinoises shadow play that had been very popular in France since 1772. Some of the animated Ombro-Cinéma toys are found with the same oriental design and Ombres Chinoises or Theatre Ombres title, but most had a design with Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character and Charles Prince's Rigadin (also interpreted as Fatty Arbuckle) on the proscenium and box. The Ombro-Cinéma received a gold medal.

At least fourteen different ""films"" with twelve images each were available, ten in black and white and four in color. The strips varied in length from circa 2.5 meters to more than 4 meter.

French circular disc versions inside children's picture books were produced in the 1940s as Album télévision and Livre de Télévision.
A French version from around 1950 was named Ciné Enfantin.
Similar wind-up musical toy ""televisions"" have been produced until late in the 20th century.


=== Maurice Bonnet's relièphographie ===
Many inventors tried to expand the number of images that could be used in line screen technology, which was mostly limited to how wide the lines could be without making the image too dark. French inventor Maurice Bonnet (1907-1994) made several patented improvements with his Relièphographie system of the same name. He used a camera with a horizontal row of eleven lenses (French patent N° 774145, June 5, 1934), followed by one with 33 lenses in 1937 (French patent n°833891, July 2, 1937). The darkness of the images is remedied with a lightbox frame. While the pictures of Estanave could only be seen from the right viewpoint, the multiple images that formed the Relièphographs ensured a clear 3D image when viewed from different angles. Bonnet was the only creator of autostereograms with line sheet technology who managed to successfully market his technique, for which he founded his ""La Relièphographie"" company in 1937. About 13 extant Relièphographie pictures by Bonnet are known, including three advertisements, two portraits and eight medical subjects. With their 30x40 cm format these are the largest preserved line sheet autostereograms. Despite the success Bonnet abandoned line sheet technology after he developed a lenticular sheet around 1940.


=== Autostereoscopic cinema ===
Russian inventor Semyon Ivanov invented an autostereoscopic cinema system in 1935. In December 1940 the 180-seat theater Moscow Stereokino was built especially for autostereoscopic movies with a rear projection screen (14×19 feet) that used 50 kilometres of fine copper wire as a barrier grid on a metal framework weighing six tons. It opened to public on February 4, 1941, premiering stereoscopic concert film Kontsert (Zemlya molodosti) by Aleksandr Andrievskiy. In 1947 Ivanov helped make the first autostereoscopic feature film Robinzon Kruzo. Moscow Stereokino showed autostereoscopic movies for 18 years and four more stereokino theatres were built in Russia. Ivanov would later work on lenticular techniques. Sergei Eisenstein wrote in 1947, relating to Ivanov's work: “To doubt that stereoscopic cinema has its tomorrows, is as naïve as doubting whether there will be tomorrows at all.”
François Savoye's first Cyclostéréoscope system with a rotating grid was shown to audiences around 1945–46 at the Paris Luna Park. An improved version was shown in the Clichy Palace in Paris in 1953. The size and weight of the required installation and the limited viewing zone to view barrier-grid movies were problems that probably made most barrier-grid cinema systems financially unviable.


=== Kinegram ===
Visual artist Gianni A. Sarcone has produced animations that he calls kinegrams since 1997. He describes his animations as ""optic kinetic media"" that ""artfully combine the visual effects of moiré patterns with the zoetrope animation technique"". Sarcone also created rotating animations that use a transparent disc with radial lines that has to be spun around its center to animate the picture.


=== Scanimation ===
""Scanimation"", incorporating sliding striped acetate sheets into book pages or folding cards to produce barrier-grid animations of six phases or more at each page, was produced by Rufus Butler Seder starting in 2007. The first book Gallop! was followed by Swing!, Kick, Waddle!, Santa and licensed scanimation books of Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz and Peanuts.

GPTZero,"GPTZero is a software used on a computer. It tries to tell if a human wrote a text or a robot, like ChatGPT. The software was made by Edward Tian, a computer science student at Princeton University. The software looks at various linguistic features and patterns to tell how likely it is that a text was produced by a human or an AI.
GPTZero became popular because of the use of AI for making content, which has raised concerns about authenticity, originality, and potential misuse.

Sacred language,"A sacred language, holy language or liturgical language is a language that is cultivated and used primarily for religious reasons (like church service) by people who speak another, primary language in their daily lives.
Some religions, or parts of them, regard the language of their sacred texts as in itself sacred. These include Hebrew in Judaism, Arabic in Islam and Sanskrit in Hinduism, and Punjabi in Sikhism. By contrast Christianity and Buddhism do not generally regard their sacred languages as sacred in themselves. Akkadian was a long used liturgical language.


== Concept ==

A sacred language is often the language which was spoken and written in the society in which a religion's sacred texts were first set down; these texts thereafter become fixed and holy, remaining frozen and immune to later linguistic developments. (An exception to this is Lucumí, a ritual lexicon of the Cuban strain of the Santería religion, with no standardized form.)
Once a language becomes associated with religious worship, its believers may ascribe virtues to the language of worship that they would not give to their native tongues. In the case of sacred texts, there is a fear of losing authenticity and accuracy by a translation or re-translation, and difficulties in achieving acceptance for a new version of a text. A sacred language is typically vested with a solemnity and dignity that the vernacular lacks. Consequently, the training of clergy in the use of a sacred language becomes an important cultural investment, and their use of the tongue is perceived to give them access to a body of knowledge that untrained laypeople cannot (or should not) access.
Because sacred languages are ascribed with virtues that the vernacular is not seen to have, these typically preserve characteristics lost in the course of language development. In some cases, the sacred language is a dead language, while in others, it may simply reflect archaic forms of a living language. For instance, 17th-century elements of the English language remain current in Protestant Christian worship through the use of the King James Bible from 1611, or older versions of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. In more extreme cases, the language has changed so much from the language of the sacred texts that the liturgy is barely comprehensible without special training. For example, the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church remained in Latin after the Council of Tours in 813 ordered preaching in local Romance or German, because Latin was no longer understood. Similarly, Old Church Slavonic is incomprehensible to speakers of modern Slavic languages, unless they study it.
Sacred languages are distinct from divine languages, which are languages ascribed to the divine (i.e. God or gods) and may not necessarily be natural languages. The concept, as expressed by the name of a script, for example in Dēvanāgarī, the name of a script that roughly means ""[script] of the city of gods"", and is used to write many Indian languages.


== Buddhism ==
When the Buddha's sutras were first written down, probably in Pali, there were around 20 schools, each with their own version derived from the original. The present Pāli Canon originates from the Tamrashatiya school. The Chinese and Tibetan canons mainly derive from the Sarvastivada, originally written in Sanskrit, of which fragments remain. The texts were translated into Chinese and Tibetan.
Theravada Buddhism uses Pali as its main liturgical language and prefers that scripture be studied in the original Pali. Pali is derived from Sanskrit. In Thailand, Pali is transliterated into the Thai alphabet, resulting in a Thai pronunciation of the Pali language. Something similar also happens in Myanmar, where Pali is also transliterated into the Burmese alphabet, also resulting in a Burmese pronunciation of Pali.
Mahayana Buddhism, now only followed by a small minority in South Asia makes little use of its original language, Sanskrit, mostly using versions of the local language. In East Asia, Classical Chinese is mainly used. In Japan, texts are written in Chinese characters and read out or recited with the Japanese pronunciations of their constituent characters.
In Vajrayana Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism is the main surviving school, and Classical Tibetan is the main language used for study, although the Tibetan Buddhist canon was also translated into other languages, such as Mongolian and Manchu. Many items of Sanskrit Buddhist literature have been preserved because they were exported to Tibet, with copies of unknown ancient Sanskrit texts surfacing in Tibet as recently as 2003. Sanskrit was valued in Tibet as the elegant language of the gods. Although in Tibetan Buddhist deity yoga the rest of the sadhana is generally recited in Tibetan, the mantra portion of the practice is usually retained in its original Sanskrit.
In Nepal, the Newar Buddhist form of Vajrayana is a storehouse of ancient Sanskrit Buddhist texts, many of which are now only extant in Nepal. Whatever language is used, Judith Simmer-Brown explains that a tantric Vajrayana text is often written in an obscure twilight language so that it cannot be understood by anyone without the verbal explanation of a qualified teacher.
Old Tamil was used for Sangam epics of Buddhist and Jain philosophy.


== Christianity ==

Christian rites, rituals, and ceremonies are not celebrated in one single sacred language. Most churches which trace their origin to the Apostles continue to use the standard languages of the first few centuries AD. Many Christian churches make a distinction between a sacred language, a liturgical language, and a vernacular language. The three most important languages in the early Christian era were Latin, Greek, and Syriac (a dialect of Aramaic).
The phrase ""Jesus, King of the Jews"" is reported in the Gospel of John as having been inscribed upon the cross in three different languages, thereby sanctifying them as the first languages to proclaim Christ's divinity. These are:

Greek, the language in which the New Testament of the Christian Bible was originally written, as well as the Septuagint (a pre-Christian translation of the Hebrew Bible). This was the lingua franca of much of the Levant in the first century AD.
Hebrew, the dominant language of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible). This was the language commonly used among most Jews in the area.
Latin, the language of the Roman Empire, which soon became an important language of the Christian Church, especially in the western provinces of the Roman Empire as well as being the language of the ""First Among Equals"", the Pope, in the Christian Pentarchy.
Liturgical languages are those which hold precedence within liturgy due to tradition and dispensation. Many of these languages have evolved from languages which were at one point vernacular, while some are intentional constructions by ecclesial authorities.
These include:

Ecclesiastical Latin in the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church.
(Old) Church Slavonic in several of the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches and sui iuris Eastern Catholic Churches
Koine Greek as well as the liturgical language of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek Catholic Church.
Old Georgian in the Georgian Orthodox Church and the Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholic Church.
Classical Armenian in the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Armenian Catholic Church.
Coptic in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Coptic Catholic Church.
Geʽez in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Eritrean Orthodox Church, Ethiopian Catholic Church and Eritrean Catholic Church.
Syriac in Syriac Christianity represented by the Syriac Orthodox Church, Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Maronite Church and Saint Thomas Christian Churches.
The extensive use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy has continued, in theory; it was used extensively on a regular basis during the Papal Mass, which has not been celebrated for some time. By the reign of Pope Damasus I, the continuous use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy had come to be replaced in part by Latin. Gradually, the Roman Liturgy took on more and more Latin until, generally, only a few words of Hebrew (e.g. Dominus Deus sabaoth) and Greek (e.g. Kyrie eleison) remained. The adoption of Latin was further fostered when the Vetus Latina (old Latin) version of the Bible was edited and parts retranslated from the original Hebrew and Greek by Saint Jerome in his Vulgate. Latin continued as the western Church's language of liturgy and communication.
In the mid-16th century the Council of Trent rejected a proposal to introduce national languages as this was seen, among other reasons, as potentially divisive to Catholic unity.
During the Reformation in England, when the Protestant authorities banned the use of Latin liturgy, various schools obtained a dispensation to continue to use Latin, for educational purposes.
From the end of the 16th century, in coastal Croatia, the local vernacular language began to replace Church Slavonic as the liturgical language. This change occurred because Church Slavonic, which had been used in the glagolitic liturgical books published in Rome, was becoming increasingly difficult to understand. This difficulty arose from linguistic reforms that adapted the Church Slavonic of Croatian recension used in Croatia to the norms of Church Slavonic used in Russia. For example, the vernacular was used to ask the bride and groom if they accepted their marriage vows.
Jesuit missionaries to China initially obtained permission to translate the Roman Missal into Classical Chinese, a scholarly form of the language. However, this permission was later revoked amid the Chinese Rites controversy. In contrast, among the Algonquin and Iroquois peoples, missionaries were allowed to translate certain parts of the Mass into their native languages.
In the 20th century, Pope Pius XII granted permission for a few vernaculars to be used in a few rites, rituals, and ceremonies. This did not include the Roman Liturgy of the Mass.
The Catholic Church, long before the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), had accepted and promoted the use of the non-vernacular liturgical languages listed above; while vernacular (i.e. modern or native) languages were also used liturgically throughout history; usually as a special concession given to religious orders conducting missionary activity.
In the 20th century, Vatican II set out to protect the use of Latin as a liturgical language. To a large degree, its prescription was disregarded and the vernacular not only became standard, but was generally used exclusively in the liturgy. Latin, which remains the chief language of the Latin liturgical rites and of Catholic canon law, but the use of liturgical Latin is now discouraged. The use of vernacular language in liturgical practice after 1964 created controversy, and opposition to liturgical vernacular is a major tenet of the Catholic Traditionalist movement. Meanwhile, the numerous Eastern Catholic Churches in union with Rome each have their own respective parent-language. 
Eastern Orthodox churches vary in their use of liturgical languages. Koine Greek and Church Slavonic are the main sacred languages used in communion. Other languages are also permitted for liturgical worship, and each country often has the liturgical services in their own language. This has led to a wide variety of languages used for liturgical worship, but there is still uniformity in the liturgical worship itself.
Liturgical languages used in the Eastern Orthodox Church include (but are not limited to): Koine Greek, Church Slavonic, Romanian, Georgian, Arabic, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, English, German, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, Albanian, Finnish, Swedish, Chinese, Estonian, Korean, Japanese, and multiple African languages.
Oriental Orthodox churches outside their ancestral lands regularly pray in the local vernacular, but some clergymen and communities prefer to retain their traditional language or use a combination of languages.
Many Anabaptist groups, such as the Amish, use High German in their worship despite not speaking it amongst themselves.


== Hinduism ==
Hinduism is traditionally considered to have Sanskrit as its primary liturgical language.


=== Sanskrit ===
Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, Bhagavad Gita, Puranas like the Bhagavatam, the Upanishads, the epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata, and various other liturgical texts such as the Sahasranama, Chamakam, and Rudram.
Sanskrit is also the tongue of Hindu rituals. It also has secular literature along with its religious canon. Most Hindu theologians of later centuries continued to prefer to write in Sanskrit even when it was no longer spoken as a day-to-day language. Sanskrit remains as the only liturgical link language which connects the different strains of Hinduism that are present across India. The de facto position that Sanskrit enjoyed, as the principal language of Hinduism, enabled its survival not only in India, but also in other areas, where Hinduism thrived like Southeast Asia.


=== Old Tamil ===
Old Tamil is the language of the Shaiva (Devaram) and Vaishnava (Divya Prabhandham) scriptures. 


=== Early Telugu ===
Most of Carnatic Music is in Telugu.
Amaravati Stupa. It is dated to 2nd century BCE and is probably, the name of a stonemason. Its structural and grammatical analysis played a key role in studying Indus script by Iravatham Mahadevan.
Several personal names and place names traceable to Telugu roots are found in various Sanskrit and Prakrit inscriptions of 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. 
Many Hindu epics were also composed in Telugu. Some examples are the Amukthamalayada, Basava Purana, Andhra Mahabharatam, and the Ranganatha Ramayanamu.


=== Others ===
Apart from Sanskrit, several Hindu spiritual works were composed in the various regional languages of India such as Hindi, Assamese, Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Odia, Maithili, Punjabi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tulu, as well as Old Javanese, and Balinese of Southeast Asia.


== Islam ==
Classical Arabic, or Qur'anic Arabic, is the language of the Qur'an. Muslims believe the Qur'an as divine revelation—it is a sacred and eternal document, and as such it is believed to be the direct word of God. Thus Muslims hold that the Qur'an is only truly the Qur'an if it is precisely as it was revealed—i.e., in Classical Arabic. Translations of the Qur'an into other languages are therefore not treated as the Qur'an itself; rather, they are seen as interpretive texts, which attempt to communicate a translation of the Qur'an's message. Salah and other rituals are also conducted in Classical Arabic for this reason. Scholars of Islam must learn and interpret the Qur'an in classical Arabic. According to the four accepted Sunni schools of jurisprudence, it is a requirement for sermons (khutbah) to be delivered completely in classical Arabic.


== Judaism ==


=== Hebrew ===
The core of the Hebrew Bible is written in Biblical Hebrew, referred to by some Jews as Lashon Hakodesh (לשון הקודש, ""Language of Holiness""). Hebrew (and in the case of a few texts such as the Kaddish, Aramaic) remains the traditional language of Jewish religious services. Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic are used extensively by the Orthodox for writing religious texts.


=== Ladino ===
Among the Sephardim, Ladino was used for translations such as the Ferrara Bible. It was also used during the Sephardi liturgy. Ladino is also often referred to as Judeo-Spanish, as it is a dialect of Castilian used by Sephardim as an everyday language until the 20th century.

Old Tamil is the language of the Shaiva (Devaram) and Vaishnava (Divya Prabhandham) scriptures. 
Classical Tibetan, known as Chhokey in Bhutan, the sacred language of Tibetan Buddhism.
Yoruba (known as Lucumi in Cuba), the language of the Yoruba people, brought to the New World by African slaves, and preserved in Santería, Candomblé, and other transplanted African religions. The Yoruba descendants in these communities, as well as non-descendants that have adopted one of the Yoruba-based religions in the diaspora, no longer speak any of the Yoruba dialects with any level of fluency.  And the liturgical usage also reflects the compromise of the language whereby there isn't an understanding of correct grammar nor proper intonation.  Spirit possession by the Yoruba deities in Cuba shows that the deity manifested in the devotee at a Cuban orisa ceremony delivers messages to the faithful in Bozal, a type of Spanish-based creole with some words of Yoruba language as well as those of Bantu origin with an inflection similar to the way Africans would speak as they were learning Spanish during enslavement.

Kinetic typography,"Kinetic typography—the technical name for ""moving text""—is an animation technique mixing motion and text to express ideas using video animation. This text is presented over time in a manner intended to convey or evoke a particular idea or emotion.


== History ==
With the advent of film and graphic animation, the possibility of matching text and motion emerged. Examples of animated letter-forms appeared as early as 1899 in the advertising work of Georges Méliès. Early feature films contained temporal typography, but this was largely static text, presented sequentially and subjected to cinematic transitions. It was not until the 1960s that opening titles began to feature typography that was truly kinetic. Scholars recognize the first feature film to extensively use kinetic typography as Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959). This film's opening title sequence—created by Saul Bass—contained animated text, featuring credits that ""flew"" in from off-screen, and finally faded out into the film itself. A similar technique was also employed by Bass in Psycho (1960).
Since then, the use of kinetic typography has become commonplace in film introductory titles and television advertisements. More recently, it has been a central feature of numerous television idents, notably Martin Lambie-Nairn's first ident for the British Channel 4 television network in use from 1982.


== Categories ==
Y. Y. Wong has proposed that it is important to distinguish between the properties of form (e.g. colour and font) and of behaviour (e.g. qualities of movement) in temporal typography. It is necessary to make this distinction in order to classify kinetic typography in ways that acknowledge their difference to static type (which may share  properties of form, but not kinetic behaviours). Kinetic typography is therefore categorised according to behaviours or action, rather than appearance.
In classification, kinetic typography is a form of temporal typography (typography that is presented over time). It is distinct from other forms of temporal typography including 'serial presentation', which involves the sequential presentation of still typographic compositions.


=== Layouts ===
Barbara Brownie's model of temporal typography divides kinetic typography into 'motion typography' (subdivided into 'scrolling typography', 'dynamic layout') and 'fluid typography'.


==== Motion typography ====

In dynamic layout, text elements move in relation to one another. Letters and words may move away from one another on a 2D plane, or in three-dimensional space. Likewise, scrolling typography can scroll across the flat screen, or can appear to recede or advance.
An iconic example is the Star Wars opening crawl inspired by the Flash Gordon serials.


==== Fluid typography ====
In fluid typography, letterforms change and evolve without necessarily changing location.
An example is the subtitles of the international release of Night Watch:
In a scene in which a character is being called by a vampire, he is in a pool and the camera is underwater.
The caption appears as blood red text that dissolves as blood would in water.


== Production ==
Kinetic typography is often produced using standard animation programs, including Adobe Flash, Adobe After Effects, and Apple Motion. The effect is most often achieved by compositing layers of text such that either individual letters or words can be animated separately from the rest.

ANSI art allowed for animation based on text characters.

Every story is not only cute, but also deep. The view of the world is pop, but people appear to have an ugly attitude. Also it has a parody of a movie. For example, Back to the future. These are the reasons more people attract. [2] An animation history researcher mentioned that molcar's appearance, the story and heartwarming attitude made it interesting and popular.
An educational critic mentioned that the animation has no conversation, so understanding of the story in music, moving facial experiences are good for children to create imagination. Also mentioned, because of the pandemic people have more time to stay at home. That is why this animation is more popular. [3]

OpenVPN,"OpenVPN is a Virtual private network protocol that is open-source. This means the source code is openly available for anyone to access and develop.  It creates secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.
An active community has formed around the OpenVPN project, which has kept it up-to-date and provided regular security audits to ensure it’s viability.
It is particularly known for its security and privacy as well as its adjustability.
OpenVPN typically works on any port and has five encryption algorithms to such as SSL, IPSec or SSH. AES 256-bit encryption is  the best security and privacy as it is essentially unbreakable. A TCP 443 port  will make a connection similar to an https connection. It is essentially a secure connection which can help prevent website blocking and bypass censorship.
For greater speed, it is recommended to use UDP ports, using the default, Blowfish-128 cipher.  This isn’t the absolute highest level of security, but for most people, it will suffice and will operate significantly faster than AES 256 on TCP.

Instrumental magnitude,"Instrumental magnitude refers to an uncalibrated apparent magnitude, and, like its counterpart, it refers to the brightness of an astronomical object, but unlike its counterpart, it is only useful in relative comparisons to other astronomical objects in the same image (assuming the photometric calibration does not spatially vary across the image; in the case of images from the Palomar Transient Factory, the absolute photometric calibration involves a zero point that varies over the image by up to 0.16 magnitudes to make a required illumination correction).  Instrumental magnitude is defined in various ways, and so when working with instrumental magnitudes, it is important to know how they are defined.  The most basic definition of instrumental magnitude, 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
, is given by

where 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 is the intensity of the source object in known physical units.  For example, in the paper by Mighell, it was assumed that the data are in units of electron number (generated within pixels of a charge-coupled device).  The physical units of the source intensity are thus part of the definition required for any instrumental magnitudes that are employed.  The factor of 2.5 in the above formula originates from the established fact that the human eye can only clearly distinguish the brightness of two objects if one is at least approximately 2.5 times brighter than the other.
The instrumental magnitude is defined such that two objects with a brightness ratio of exactly 100 will differ by precisely 5 magnitudes, and this is based on Pogson's system of defining each successive magnitude as being fainter by

The approximate value of 2.5 is used as a convenience, its negative sign assures that brighter objects will have smaller and possibly negative values, and tabulated values of base-10 logarithms were available more than three centuries before the advent of computers and calculators.

Pyrophobia,"Pyrophobia  is a fear of fire, which can be considered irrational if beyond what is considered normal. This phobia is ancient and primordial, perhaps since humanity's discovery of fire. Usually pertaining to humans' comprehensible reaction to fire itself, the fear of fire by other animals cannot be considered pyrophobic, as they are thought not to understand its purpose beyond general danger.


== Signs and symptoms ==
When witnessing fire or smoke (even if the fire poses no threat, such as a candle), suspecting a fire is nearby, or (in some cases) visualizing fires, pyrophobes exhibit typical psychological and physiological symptoms of fear and panic: acute stress, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, tightness in chest, sweating, nausea, shaking or trembling, dry mouth, needing to go to the bathroom, dizziness and/or fainting. A pyrophobe may also attempt to avoid or flee from fires, and avoid situations where harmless fire may be present (such as a barbecue or a campfire). The severity of pyrophobia can range from inconvenient to disturbing a person's daily functioning.


== Causes ==
The most common cause of pyrophobia is that fire poses a potential threat to life safety (which is identical in animals). However, people who are intensely pyrophobic cannot even get close to or tolerate even a small controlled fire, such as fireplace, bonfire or lit candle. In many cases a bad childhood experience with fire may have triggered the condition.


== Treatment ==
Exposure therapy is the most common way to treat pyrophobia. This method involves showing patients fires in order of increasing size, from a lit cigarette up to a stove or grill flame.
Another method of treatment is talk therapy, in which a patient tells a therapist about the cause of this fear. This can calm the patient to make them less afraid of controlled fire.
People can relieve pyrophobia by interacting with other pyrophobes to share their experiences that caused fear. Alternatively, pyrophobia can be treated using hypnosis.
Medication can also be used to treat pyrophobic people, although since it has side effects, the method is not highly recommended.

Sanctification in Christianity,"Sanctification (or in its verb form, sanctify) literally means ""to set apart for special use or purpose"", that is, to make holy or sacred (compare Latin: sanctus).  Therefore, sanctification refers to the state or process of being set apart, i.e. ""made holy"", as a vessel, full of the Holy Spirit of God.  The concept of sanctification is widespread among religions, including Judaism and especially Christianity. The term can be used to refer to objects which are set apart for special purposes, but the most common use within Christian theology is in reference to the change brought about by God in a believer, begun at the point of salvation and continuing throughout the life of the believer. Many forms of Christianity believe that this process will only be completed in Heaven, but some (particularly the Methodist and Quaker traditions, inclusive of the Holiness movement) believe that complete entire sanctification is possible in this life.


== Christianity ==
In the various branches of Christianity sanctification usually refers to a person becoming holy, with the details differing in different branches.
Sanctification means that self (attitudes, desires, self-will, etc.) is crucified and that you are no longer carnal(in your thoughts, actions, or mind). So, you get filled with the Holy Ghost. This is also known as the second work of grace. In sanctification it is higher level of purging God does because you're no longer carnal. Also, God will still show you things about yourself, but it should never be carnal.


=== Roman Catholicism ===
The Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of sanctification, teaching that:

Sanctifying grace is that grace which confers on our souls a new life, that is, sharing in the life of God. Our reconciliation with God, which the redemption of Christ has merited for us, finds its accomplishments in sanctifying grace. Through this most precious gift we participate in the divine life; we have the right to be called children of God. This grace is the source of all our supernatural merits and bestows upon us the right of eternal glory.
Saint Paul of the Cross stated that ""Prayer, good reading, the frequent reception of the sacraments, with the proper dispositions, and particularly the flight of idleness—these are, believe me, the means of sanctifying yourself.""
According to the Catholic Encyclopedia ""sanctity"" differs for God, individual, and corporate body. For God, it is God's unique absolute moral perfection. For the individual, it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection. It is essentially of God, by a divine gift. For a society, it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members, who display a real, not merely nominal, holiness. The Church's holiness is beyond human power, beyond natural power.


=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
Orthodox Christianity teaches the doctrine of theosis, whereby humans take on divine properties, and in a particular sense, participate in the being of God. A key scripture supporting this is 2 Peter 1:4. In the 4th century, Athanasius of Alexandria taught that God became Man that man might become God. Essentially, man does not become divine, but in Christ can partake of divine nature. This Church's version of salvation restores the likeness of God in man. One such theme is release from mortality caused by desires of the world.


=== Lutheranism ===
Martin Luther taught in his Large Catechism that Sanctification is only caused by the Holy Spirit through the powerful Word of God. The Holy Spirit uses churches to gather Christians together for the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.

Sanctification is the Holy Spirit's work of making us holy. When the Holy Spirit creates faith in us, he renews in us the image of God so that through his power we produce good works. These good works are not meritorious but show the faith in our hearts (Ephesians 2:8-10, James 2:18).  Sanctification flows from justification.  It is an on-going process which will not be complete or reach perfection in this life.
Luther also viewed the Ten Commandments as means by which the Holy Spirit sanctifies. ""Thus we have the Ten Commandments, a commend of divine doctrine, as to what we are to do in order that our whole life may be pleasing to God, and the true fountain and channel from and in which everything must arise and flow that is to be a good work, so that outside of the Ten Commandments no work or thing can be good or pleasing to God, however great or precious it be in the eyes of the world...whoever does attain to them is a heavenly, angelic man, far above all holiness of the world. Only occupy yourself with them, and try your best, apply all power and ability, and you will find so much to do that you will neither seek nor esteem any other work or holiness.""
Pietistic Lutheranism heavily emphasizes the ""biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living, or sanctification.""


=== Anabaptism ===
Anabaptist belief emphasizes that sanctification is initiated by being born again by the Spirit of God and then practiced by following or being a disciple of Christ. The role of the Spirit, Word of God, suffering, self-denial as well as the community of believers in sanctification is also considered essential. Sanctification is believed to be a process that begins with conversion and continues throughout the Christian life. Perfectionism or eradication of the flesh is rejected and it is considered necessary to take up the cross and deny yourself daily to truly be a disciple of Christ. When a believer steps out of the sanctification process, his salvation is seen as jeopardized. Sanctification is seen as mortifying the deeds of the flesh, cleansing impure motives and thoughts of the mind and heart as well as glorifying the Father through worship, obedience and faith working in love.


=== Anglicanism ===
A 2002 Anglican publishing house book states that “there is no explicit teaching on sanctification in the Anglican formularies”. A glossary of the Episcopal Church (USA) gives some teaching: “Anglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God's work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life.” Outside official formularies sanctification has been an issue in the Anglican Communion since its inception.
The 16th  century Anglican theologian Richard Hooker (1554-1600) distinguished between the “righteousness of justification” that is imputed by God and the “righteousness of sanctification” that comprises the works one does as an “inevitable” result of being justified.
Jeremy Taylor (1613-1667) argued that justification and sanctification cannot be separated; they are “two steps in a long process”.
A 19th century Church of England work agreed with Jeremy Taylor that justification and sanctification are “inseparable”. However, they are not the same thing. Justification is “found in Christ's work alone”. “Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, and is a progressive work.”


=== Baptist ===
Baptists believe in progressive sanctification, the work of sanctification of the believer through grace and the decisions of the believer after the new birth.


=== Reformed ===
It is not clear that John Calvin, in his Institutes of the Christian Religion, conceives of sanctification as a doctrine separate from justification. There is no separate treatment there of a doctrine of sanctification. Instead, the clearest references he makes to the process of the Christian's growth in holiness appear in Book III of the Institutes, which concerns the work of the Holy Spirit. There he intermixes the grace by which justification is accomplished and the grace that empowers the Christian toward moral reform. Following Augustine, Calvin embraces a non-perfectionist account of sanctification as progressive but incomplete until eschatological consummation:""I insist not that the life of the Christian shall breathe nothing but the perfect Gospel, though this is to be desired, and ought to be attempted. I insist not so strictly on evangelical perfection, as to refuse to acknowledge as a Christian any man who has not attained it. In this way all would be excluded from the church, since there is no man who is not far removed from this perfection, while many, who have made but little progress, would be undeservedly rejected.""  Against those who ""maintain the perfection of holiness in the present life,"" Calvin replies:""...we deem it sufficient briefly to reply with Augustine, that the goal to which all the pious ought to aspire is, to appear in the presence of God without spot or blemish; but as the course of the present life is at best nothing more than progress, we shall never reach the goal until we have laid aside the body of sin, and been completely united to the Lord.""  But the imperfection of sanctification in this life is not, for Calvin, an excuse for slackness in the search thereof. The grace of justification is not separable from the grace that makes one perform good works and the grace that perfects what is deficient in the works of the regenerate:“Justification, moreover, we thus define: the sinner being admitted into communion with Christ is, for his sake, reconciled to God; when purged by his blood he obtains the remission of sins, and clothed with righteousness, just as if it were his own, stands secure before the judgment seat of heaven. Forgiveness of sins being previously given, the good works which follow have a value different from their merit, because whatever is imperfect in them is covered by the perfection of Christ, and all their blemishes and pollutions are wiped away by his purity, so as never to come under the cognizance of the divine tribunal. The guilt of all transgressions, by which men are prevented from offering God an acceptable service, being thus effaced, and the imperfection which is wont to sully even good works being buried, the good works which are done by believers are deemed righteous, or, which is the same thing, are imputed for righteousness.” 


=== Methodist ===
In Wesleyan–Arminian theology, which is upheld by the Methodist Churches (inclusive of the holiness movement), Methodism teaches that sanctification has three components—initial, progressive, and entire:

We believe that sanctification is that work of the Holy Spirit by which the child of God is separated from sin unto God and is enabled to love God with all the heart and to walk in all His holy commandments blameless. Sanctification is initiated at the moment of justification and regeneration. From that moment there is a gradual or progressive sanctification as the believer walks with God and daily grows in grace and in a more perfect obedience to God. This prepares for the crisis of entire sanctification which is wrought instantaneously when believers present themselves as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God, through faith in Jesus Christ, being effected by the baptism with the Holy Spirit who cleanses the heart from all inbred sin. The crisis of entire sanctification perfects the believer in love and empowers that person for effective service. It is followed by lifelong growth in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The life of holiness continues through faith in the sanctifying blood of Christ and evidences itself by loving obedience to God’s revealed will. —Articles of Religion, The Wesleyan Church
As such, ""sanctification, the beginning of holiness, begins at the new birth"". With the Grace of God, Methodists ""do works of piety and mercy, and these works reflect the power of sanctification"". Examples of these means of grace (works of piety and works of mercy) that aid with sanctification include frequent reception of the sacrament of Holy Communion (work of piety), and visiting the sick and those in prison (work of mercy). Wesleyan covenant theology also emphasizes that an important aspect of sanctification is the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments. As such, in ""sanctification one grows to be more like Christ."" This process of sanctification that begins at the new birth (first work of grace) has its goal as Christian perfection, also known as entire sanctification (second work of grace), which John Wesley, the progenitor of the Methodist faith, described as a heart ""habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor"" and as ""having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked"".  To John Wesley the work of entire sanctification was distinctly separate from regeneration, and was ""wrought instantaneously, though it may be approached by slow and gradual steps."" A more complete statement of Wesley's position goes like this:""It is that habitual disposition of soul which, in the sacred writings, is termed holiness; and which directly implies, the being cleansed from sin, 'from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit;' and, by consequence, the being endued with those virtues which were also in Christ Jesus; the being so 'renewed in the spirit of our mind,' as to be 'perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect.'""This is the doctrine that by the power of God's sanctifying grace and attention upon the means of grace may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of original sin in this life. It is expounded upon in the Methodist Articles of Religion: 
Sanctification is that renewal of our fallen nature by the Holy Ghost, received through faith in Jesus Christ, whose blood of atonement cleanseth from all sin; whereby we are not only delivered from the guilt of sin, but are washed from its pollution, saved from its power, and are enabled, through grace, to love God with all our hearts and to walk in his holy commandments blameless.
Terming the experience of entire sanctification the baptism of the Holy Spirit, John William Fletcher, the systematic theologian of Methodism, emphasized that the experience of entire sanctification through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit cleanses the believer from original sin and empowers the believer for service to God.
Justification is seen as an initial step of acknowledging God's holiness, with sanctification as, through the grace and power of God, entering into it.  A key scripture is Hebrews 12:14:  ""Follow after...holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord."" The importance of ""growth in grace"", according to Methodist doctrine, is important before and after entire sanctification:

In order to maintain right relationship with God; it is necessary that we grow in grace (Eph. 4:15, 16; Col. 2:6, 7: I Pet. 1:5-10; II Pet. 3:18), both before and after sanctification. There is, however, a more abundant growth with increased fruitage after sanctification (John 15:2). To keep sanctified the soul must continually seek God's face and strength (Luke 21:36; Psalm 105:4). This is the maturing process of all Spirit-filled saints. 
—Articles of Religion, Immanuel Missionary Church
In the same vein, in addition to entire sanctification, the Kentucky Mountain Holiness Association affirms a belief in ""the progressive growth in grace toward Christian maturity through a consistent Christian life of faith and good works.""
Methodist theology teaches that the state of entire sanctification can be lost through willful sin:

After we have received the Holy Ghost, any careless attitude toward the covenant we entered into when we were sanctified shall cause us to depart from grace given, and to fall into sin. Only through deep repentance, which God may permit, shall we then turn to God and receive forgiveness of our sins. ―Principles of Faith, Emmanuel Association of Churches
If a person backslides but later decides to return to God, he or she must confess his or her sins and be entirely sanctified again (see conditional security).
John Wesley taught outward holiness as an expression of ""inward transformation"" and theologians in the Wesleyan/Methodist tradition have noted that the observance of standards of dress and behaviour should follow the New Birth as an act of obedience to God.


=== Pentecostalism ===
There are two Pentecostal positions on sanctification, entire sanctification and progressive sanctification.
Entire sanctification as a second work of grace, is the position of Pentecostal denominations that originally had their roots in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, such as Apostolic Faith Church, Calvary Holiness Association, International Pentecostal Holiness Church, Church of God (Cleveland) and Church of God in Christ. These denominations differ from the Methodist Churches (inclusive of the Holiness Movement) in that they teach the possibility of a third work of grace—glossolalia.
Progressive sanctification is the work of sanctification of the believer through grace and the decisions of the believer after the new birth. This is the position of other Pentecostal denominations, such as Assemblies of God and The Foursquare Church.


=== Quakerism ===
George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, taught Christian perfection, also known in the Friends tradition as ""Perfectionism"", in which the Christian believer could be made free from sin. In his Some Principles of the Elect People of God Who in Scorn are called Quakers, for all the People throughout all Christendome to Read over, and thereby their own States to Consider, he writes in section ""XVI. Concerning Perfection"":

HE that hath brought Man into Imperfection is the Devil, and his work who led from God; for Man was Perfect before he fell, for all God's Works are Perfect; So Christ that destroyes the Devil and his works, makes man Perfect again, destroying him that made him Imperfect, which the Law could not do; so by his Blood doth he cleanse from all Sin; And by one offering, hath he Perfected for ever them that are Sanctified; And they that do not Believe in the Light which comes from Christ, by which they might see the Offering, and receive the Blood, are in the unbelief concerning this.
And the Apostles that were in the Light, Christ Jesus, (which destroyes the Devil and his works) spoke Wisdom among them that were Perfect, though they could not among those that were Carnal; And their Work was for the perfecting of the Saints, for that cause had they their Ministry given to them until they all came to the Knowledge of the Son of God, which doth destroy the Devil and his works, And which ends the Prophets, first Covenant, Types, Figures, Shadowes; And until they all came to the Unity of the Faith which purified their hearts, which gave them Victory over that which seperated [sic] from God, In which they had access to God, by which Faith they pleased him, by which they were Justified; And so until they came unto a Perfect Man, unto the Measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ; and so the Apostle said, Christ in you we Preach the hope of Glory, warning every man, that we might present every Man Perfect in Christ Jesus.
The early Quakers, following Fox, taught that as a result of the New Birth through the power of the Holy Spirit, man could be free from actual sinning if he continued to rely on the inward light and ""focus on the cross of Christ as the center of faith"". George Fox emphasized ""personal responsibility for faith and emancipation from sin"" in his teaching on perfectionism. For the Christian, ""perfectionism and freedom from sin were possible in this world"".
Some Quaker denominations were founded to emphasize this teaching, such as the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends.


=== Keswickianism ===
Keswickian theology, which emerged in the Higher Life Movement, teaches a second work of grace that occurs through ""surrender and faith"", in which God keeps an individual from sin. Keswickian denominations, such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, differ from the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in that the Christian and Missionary Alliance does not see entire sanctification as cleansing one from original sin, whereas holiness denominations espousing the Wesleyan-Arminian theology affirm this belief.


=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctification is viewed as a process and gift from God which makes every willing member holy, according to their repentance and righteous efforts, through the Savior Jesus Christ's matchless grace. To become Sanctified, or Holy, one must do all that he can to live as Christ lived, according to the teachings of Christ. One must strive to live a holy life to truly be considered Holy. In the Church's scriptural canon, one reference to sanctification appears in Helaman 3:35, in the Book of Mormon:Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God. Elder Dallin H. Oaks, then of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, also expounded on the meaning of sanctity.

Nomogram,"A nomogram, alignment chart or abaque is a graph for calculation. It is a two-dimensional diagram which gives a computation of a mathematical function. 
The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne (1862–1938). It was used for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.
A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. 
The result is got by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth.


== Use ==
Nomograms were widely used for about 75 years. They allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are got quickly and reliably by drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a slide rule, or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. 
Nomograms have domain knowledge into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. 
Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device. Like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned.A slide rule is a general-purpose calculator, but a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation. Nomograms can still be used to check an answer from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation.

Individuals and organizations that consume energy may conserve energy to reduce costs and promote economic, political and environmental sustainability.  Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximize profit.
On a larger scale, energy conservation is an energy policy.  In general, energy conservation  reduces the energy consumption and energy demand per capita.  This reduces the rise in energy costs, and can reduce the need for new power plants, and energy imports.  The reduced energy demand can provide more flexibility in choosing the methods of energy production.
By reducing emissions, energy conservation helps to prevent climate change.  Energy conservation makes it easier to replace non-renewable resources with renewable energy.  Energy conservation is often the most economical solution to energy shortages.


== Energy efficiency trends in the United States ==
The U.S. is the largest consumer of energy, although at current levels of growth, China may become the leading energy consumer. The U.S. Department of Energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors: transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial.
Energy usage in the transportation and residential sectors (about half of U.S. energy consumption) is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers.  Commercial and industrial energy usage are controlled by businesses.  National energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors.


=== Transportation sector ===
The transportation sector includes all vehicles used for personal or freight transportation. Of the energy used in this sector, about 65% is used by gasoline-powered vehicles, mostly personally owned. Diesel-powered transport (trains, merchant ships, heavy trucks, etc.) consumes about 20%, and air traffic consumes most of the remaining 15%.
The oil supply crises of the 1970s spurred the creation, in 1975, of the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, which required auto manufacturers to meet progressively higher fleet fuel economy targets.  The next decade saw dramatic improvements in fuel economy, mostly the result of reductions in vehicle size and weight. These gains eroded somewhat after 1990 due to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans, which fall under the more lenient ""light truck"" CAFE standard.
In addition to the CAFE program, the U.S. government has tried to encourage better vehicle efficiency through tax policy.  Since 2002, taxpayers have been eligible for income tax credits for gas/electric hybrid vehicles. A ""gas-guzzler"" tax has been assessed on manufacturers since 1978 for cars with exceptionally poor fuel economy.  While this tax remains in effect, it currently generates very little revenue as overall fuel economy has improved.
Another focus in gasoline conservation is reducing the number of miles driven. An estimated 40% of American automobile use is associated with daily commuting. Many urban areas offer subsidized public transportation to reduce commuting traffic, and encourage carpooling by providing designated high-occupancy vehicle lanes and lower tolls for cars with multiple riders. In recent years telecommuting has also become a viable alternative to commuting for some jobs. 
A vehicle's gas mileage normally decreases rapidly at speeds above 55 miles per hour.  A car or truck moving at 55 miles an hour can get about 15 percent better fuel economy than the same car going 65 mph. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), as a rule of thumb, each 5 mph you drive over 60 mph is similar to paying an additional $1.20 per gallon for gas (at $3.10 per gallon).


=== Residential sector ===
The residential sector refers to all private residences, including single-family homes, apartments, manufactured homes and dormitories.  Energy use in this sector varies significantly across the country, due to regional climate differences and different regulation.  On average, about half of the energy used in the U.S. homes is expended on space conditioning (i.e. heating and cooling).
The efficiency of furnaces and air conditioners has increased steadily since the energy crises of the 1970s. The 1987 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act authorized the Department of Energy to set minimum efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment and other appliances each year, based on what is ""technologically feasible and economically justified"".
Despite technological improvements, many American lifestyle changes have put higher demands on heating and cooling resources.  The average size of homes built in the United States has increased significantly, from 1500 ft² in 1970 to 2300 ft² in 2005.  The single-person household has become more common, as has central air conditioning: 23% of households had central air conditioning in 1978, that figure rose to 55% by 2001.
As a cheaper alternative to the purchase of a new furnace or air conditioner, most public utilities encourage smaller changes the consumer can make.  Consumers have also been asked to adopt a wider indoor temperature range (e.g. 65 °F in the winter, 80 °F in the summer).


==== Home energy consumption averages: ====
space conditioning (includes both heating and air conditioning) 44%
water heating, 13%
lighting, 12%
refrigeration, 8%
home electronics, 6%
laundry appliances, 5%
kitchen appliances, 4%
other uses, 8%
Energy usage in some homes may vary widely from these averages. In most residences no single appliance dominates, and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas in order to achieve substantial energy savings.  However, ground source heat pump systems are the more energy efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective space conditioning systems available (Environmental Protection Agency). They can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 70%.


==== Best building practices ====
Current best practices in building design and construction result in homes that are much more energy conserving than average new homes.  See Passive house, Superinsulation, Self-sufficient homes, Zero energy building, Earthship, Straw-bale construction, MIT Design Advisor, Energy Conservation Code for Indian Commercial Buildings.
Smart ways to construct homes such that minimal resources are used to cooling and heating the house in summer and winter respectively can significantly reduce energy costs!


=== Commercial sector ===
The commercial sector consists of retail stores, offices (business and government), restaurants, schools and other workplaces.  Energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector, in slightly different proportions. Space conditioning is again the single biggest consumption area, but it represents only about 30% of the energy use of commercial buildings.  Lighting, at 25%, plays a much larger role than it does in the residential sector.  Lighting is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use.  A number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of over-illumination can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings.
Commercial buildings can greatly increase energy efficiency by thoughtful design, with today's building stock being very poor examples of the potential of systematic (not expensive) energy efficient design (Steffy, 1997).  Commercial buildings often have professional management, allowing centralized control and coordination of energy conservation efforts.
Solar heat loading through standard window designs usually leads to high demand for air conditioning in summer months.  An example of building design overcoming this excessive heat loading is the Dakin Building in Brisbane, California, where fenestration was designed to achieve an angle with respect to sun incidence to allow maximum reflection of solar heat; this design also assisted in reducing interior over-illumination to enhance worker efficiency and comfort.


=== Industrial sector ===
The industrial sector represents all production and processing of goods, including manufacturing, construction, farming, water management and mining.  Increasing costs have forced energy-intensive industries to make substantial efficiency improvements in the past 30 years.  For example, the energy used to produce steel and paper products has been cut 40% in that time frame, while petroleum/aluminum refining and cement production have reduced their usage by about 25%.  These reductions are largely the result of recycling waste material and the use of cogeneration equipment for electricity and heating.
The energy required for delivery and treatment of fresh water often constitutes a significant percentage of a region's electricity and natural gas usage (an estimated 20% of California's total energy use is water-related.)  In light of this, some local governments have worked toward a more integrated approach to energy and water conservation efforts.
Unlike the other sectors, total energy use in the industrial sector has declined in the last decade.  While this is partly due to conservation efforts, it's also a reflection of the growing trend for U.S. companies to move manufacturing operations offshore.
The usage of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many Americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.

Byzantine art,"Byzantine art is a form of Christian Greek art of the Eastern Roman Empire (now called the Byzantine Empire) from about the 5th century to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.
However, the term can also be for other the art of countries who shared their culture with the Byzantine Empire, including Bulgaria, Serbia and Rus. The Republic of Venice and Kingdom of Sicily can also be included even though they were part of Western European culture. Art that was produced by Balkan and Anatolian Christians who lived in the Ottoman Empire is often called ""post-Byzantine."" Certain traditions that began in the Byzantine Empire, particularly icon painting and church architecture, are still current in Greece, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries.

Sapele,"Entandrophragma cylindricum is a tree of the genus Entandrophragma of the family Meliaceae. It is commonly known as sapele or sapelli ( sə-PEE-lee) or sapele mahogany, as well as aboudikro, assi, and muyovu.


== Origin of the name ==

The name sapele comes from that of the city of Sapele in Nigeria, where there is a preponderance of the tree. African Timber and Plywood (AT&P), a division of the United Africa Company, had a factory at this location where the wood, along with Triplochiton scleroxylon, Obeche, mahogany, and Khaya was processed into timber which was then exported from the Port of Sapele worldwide.
The name of the city itself is said to be an anglicisation of the Urhobo word Uriapele, commemorating a local deity. It is believed the British colonial authorities changed the name of the then hamlet to Sapele as it was easier to pronounce.


== Description ==
Entandrophragma cylindricum is native to tropical Africa. There are protected populations and felling restrictions in place in various countries.
The species grows to a height of up to 45 m. In Ghana it has been reported to reach 198 feet (sixty meters) in height. The leaves are deciduous in the dry season, alternately arranged, pinnate, with 5-9 pairs of leaflets, each leaflet about 10 cm long. The flowers are produced in loose inflorescences when the tree is leafless, each flower about 5 mm diameter, with five yellowish petals. The fruit is a pendulous capsule about 10 cm long and 4 cm broad; when mature it splits into five sections to release the 15-20 seeds.


== Uses ==

This commercially important hardwood is reminiscent of mahogany, and is a part of the same Meliaceae family. It is darker in tone and has a distinctive figure, typically applied where figure is important. Sapele is particularly prized for a lustrous iridescence with colors that range from light pink to brown and gold to red. It has a high density range of 640-750kg/m3 and interlocked grain, which can make machining somewhat difficult. Demand for sapele increased as a mahogany substitute in recent years due to genuine mahogany becoming a CITES Appendix II listed species. It is used in the manufacture of furniture, joinery, veneers, luxury flooring, musical instruments, and boat building.
Among its more exotic uses is in musical instruments. It is used for the back and sides (and sometimes top) of acoustic guitar bodies, as well as the bodies of electric guitars. It is also used in manufacturing the neck piece of ukuleles and 26- and 36-string harps. In the late 1990s, it started to be used as a board for Basque percussion instruments txalaparta.

Crown gear,"A crown gear is a gear where the teeth of the gear are not flat, but at an angle. The most common such angle is a right angle (90 degrees). The name crown gear comes from the facr that these gears look like crowns. Crown gears were widely used in antiquity and the Middle Ages. In modern times they were replaced by bevel gear. This is mainly because with bevel gear, the calculations are easier.",0
Adverse effect (medicine),"In medicine, an adverse effect is a harmful and undesired effect that results from a therapy like medication, chemotherapy, surgery or other intervention. An adverse effect may be called a ""side-effect"" (when it is less important than the therapeutic effect).
It may result from an unsuitable or incorrect dosage or procedure (which could be caused by medical error). Some adverse effects happen only at the beginning or a change of a treatment.  Medical error was the third most common cause of death in the United States in 2019.


== Reporting systems ==
In many countries, adverse effects have to be reported and researched in clinical trials and included into the patient information accompanying medical devices and drugs for sale to the public.  This is called pharmacovigilance.

Gnosis,"Gnosis is the common Greek noun for knowledge (γνῶσις, gnōsis, f.). The term was used among various Hellenistic religions and philosophies in the Greco-Roman world. It is best known for its implication within Gnosticism, where it signifies a spiritual knowledge or insight into humanity's real nature as divine, leading to the deliverance of the divine spark within humanity from the constraints of earthly existence.


== Etymology ==
Gnosis is a feminine Greek noun which means ""knowledge"" or ""awareness."" It is often used for personal knowledge compared with intellectual knowledge (εἴδειν eídein), as with the French connaître compared with savoir, the Portuguese conhecer compared with saber, the Spanish conocer compared with saber, the Italian conoscere compared with sapere, the German kennen rather than wissen, or the Modern Greek γνωρίζω compared with ξέρω.
A related term is the adjective gnostikos, ""cognitive"", a reasonably common adjective in Classical Greek. The terms do not appear to indicate any mystic, esoteric or hidden meaning in the works of Plato, but instead expressed a sort of higher intelligence and ability analogous to talent.

Plato The Statesman 258e
In the Hellenistic era the term became associated with the mystery cults.
In the Acts of Thomas, translated by G.R.S. Mead, the ""motions of gnosis"" are also referred to as ""kingly motions"".
Irenaeus used the phrase ""knowledge falsely so-called"" (pseudonymos gnosis, from 1 Timothy 6:20) for the title of his book On the Detection and Overthrow of False Knowledge, that contains the adjective gnostikos, which is the source for the 17th-century English term ""Gnosticism"".


== Comparison with epignosis ==
The difference and meaning of epignosis (Greek: ἐπίγνωσις) contrasted with gnosis is disputed. One proposed distinction is between the abstract and absolute knowledge (gnosis) and a practical or more literal knowledge (epignosis). Other interpretations have suggested that 2 Peter is referring to an ""epignosis of Jesus Christ"", what J. B. Lightfoot described as a ""larger and more thorough knowledge"". Conversion to Christianity is seen as evidence of the deeper knowledge protecting against false doctrine.


== Gnosticism ==

Gnosticism originated in the late 1st century CE in non-rabbinical Jewish and early Christian sects. In the formation of Christianity, various sectarian groups, labeled ""gnostics"" by their opponents, emphasised spiritual knowledge (gnosis) of the divine spark within, over faith (pistis) in the teachings and traditions of the various communities of Christians. Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God, and the Demiurge, ""creator"" of the material universe. The Gnostics considered the most essential part of the process of salvation to be this personal knowledge, in contrast to faith as an outlook in their worldview along with faith in the ecclesiastical authority.
In Gnosticism, the biblical serpent in the Garden of Eden was praised and thanked for bringing knowledge (gnosis) to Adam and Eve and thereby freeing them from the malevolent Demiurge's control. Gnostic Christian doctrines rely on a dualistic cosmology that implies the eternal conflict between good and evil, and a conception of the serpent as the liberating savior and bestower of knowledge to humankind opposed to the Demiurge or creator god, identified with the Hebrew God of the Old Testament. Gnostic Christians considered the Hebrew God of the Old Testament as the evil, false god and creator of the material universe, and the Unknown God of the Gospel, the father of Jesus Christ and creator of the spiritual world, as the true, good God. In the Archontic, Sethian, and Ophite systems, Yaldabaoth (Yahweh) is regarded as the malevolent Demiurge and false god of the Old Testament who generated the material universe and keeps the souls trapped in physical bodies, imprisoned in the world full of pain and suffering that he created.
However, not all Gnostic movements regarded the creator of the material universe as inherently evil or malevolent. For instance, Valentinians believed that the Demiurge is merely an ignorant and incompetent creator, trying to fashion the world as good as he can, but lacking the proper power to maintain its goodness. All Gnostics were regarded as heretics by the proto-orthodox Early Church Fathers.


=== Mandaeism ===

In Mandaeism, the concept of manda (""knowledge"", ""wisdom"", ""intellect"") is roughly equivalent to the Gnostic concept of gnosis. Mandaeism ('having knowledge') is the only surviving Gnostic religion from antiquity.: 15  Mandaeans formally refer to themselves as Nasurai (Nasoraeans) meaning guardians or possessors of secret rites and knowledge. The Mandaeans emphasize salvation of the soul through secret knowledge (gnosis) of its divine origin. Mandaeism ""provides knowledge of whence we have come and whither we are going."": 531 


== Christian usage ==
Despite rejection of Gnosticism, Christianity has sometimes used the term or derivatives of it in a laudatory rather than lambasting sense. 


=== New Testament ===
The New Testament uses the term γνῶσις (Strong's G1108, Transliteration gnōsis) 28 times.


=== Patristic literature ===
The Church Fathers used the word gnosis (knowledge) to mean spiritual knowledge or specific knowledge of the divine. This positive usage was to contrast it with how gnostic sectarians used the word. Cardiognosis (""knowledge of the heart"") from Eastern Christianity related to the tradition of the starets and in Roman Catholic theology is the view that only God knows the condition of one's relationship with God.
Boston College Catholic philosopher Dermot Moran notes that

...even in early Christianity, matters were complex, such that an anti-gnostic writer like Clement of Alexandria can regularly invoke the notion of gnostike theoria in a positive sense.


=== Eastern Orthodox thought ===
Gnosis in Orthodox Christian (primarily Eastern Orthodox) thought is the spiritual knowledge of a saint (one who has obtained theosis) or divinely-illuminated human being. Within the cultures of the term's provenance (Byzantine and Hellenic) Gnosis was a knowledge or insight into the infinite, divine and uncreated in all and above all, rather than knowledge strictly into the finite, natural or material world. Gnosis is transcendental as well as mature understanding. It indicates direct spiritual, experiential knowledge and intuitive knowledge, mystic rather than that from rational or reasoned thinking. Gnosis itself is gained through understanding at which one can arrive via inner experience or contemplation such as an internal epiphany of intuition and external epiphany such as the theophany.
In the Philokalia, it is emphasized that such knowledge is not secret knowledge but rather a maturing, transcendent form of knowledge derived from contemplation (theoria resulting from practice of hesychasm), since knowledge cannot truly be derived from knowledge, but rather, knowledge can only be derived from theoria (to witness, see (vision) or experience). Knowledge, thus plays an important role in relation to theosis (deification/personal relationship with God) and theoria (revelation of the divine, vision of God). Gnosis, as the proper use of the spiritual or noetic faculty plays an important role in Orthodox Christian theology. Its importance in the economy of salvation is discussed periodically in the Philokalia where as direct, personal knowledge of God (noesis) it is distinguished from ordinary epistemological knowledge (episteme—i.e., speculative philosophy).


== Islam ==


=== Sufism ===

Knowledge (or gnosis) in Sufism refers to knowledge of Self and God. The gnostic is called al-arif bi'lah or ""one who knows by God"". The goal of the Sufi practitioner is to remove inner obstacles to the knowledge of God. Sufism, understood as the quest for Truth, is to seek for the separate existence of the Self to be consumed by Truth, as stated by the Sufi poet Mansur al-Hallaj, who was executed for saying ""I am the Truth"" (ana'l haqq).


== Jewish usage ==


=== Hellenistic Jewish literature ===
The Greek word gnosis (knowledge) is used as a standard translation of the Hebrew word ""knowledge"" (דעת da'ath) in the Septuagint, thus:

The Lord gives wisdom [ħokhma] (sophia), from his face come knowledge [da'ath] (gnosis) and understanding [tevuna] (synesis)""
Philo also refers to the ""knowledge"" (gnosis) and ""wisdom"" (sophia) of God.

Birch bark,"Birch bark or birchbark is usually the bark of the paper birch tree or sometimes of similar trees such as gray (wire) birch.
Birch bark is useful because it is strong and water-resistant. It is similar in some ways to cardboard. And can be easily cut, bent and sewn. Because of this it has been very valuable for building, crafting, and writing material ever since ancient times.  Birch bark also contains substances that are used in medicines and chemicals.


== Uses ==

Birch bark was valuable throughout the world where birch trees were available:

In North America, the native people used birch bark for canoes and wigwams and more.
In Scandinavia and Finland, it had many uses, including roofs, boxes, casks and buckets.
In Russia, many birch bark documents have survived from the Middle Ages.
In the Indian civilisation birch-bark, along with dried palm leaves,  replaced parchment for writing.
Birch bark is can also be used as a tinder. It is very good tinder as the inner layers will stay dry even through heavy rainstorms.  To make birch bark useless as tinder, it must be soaked in water for a very long time.

Animated sitcom,"An animated sitcom is a subgenre of a television sitcom that is animated instead of being filmed live-action, and is generally made or created for adult audiences in most cases. The Simpsons, SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park, and Family Guy are four of the longest-running animated sitcoms.


== History ==


=== Early history ===

The Flintstones, which debuted in 1960, is considered the first example of the animated sitcom genre. A similar cartoon, The Jetsons, which took place in the future rather than the past, followed in 1962. Marc Blake argued it started the ""science fiction sitcom sub genre"".
Animated sitcoms have been more controversial than traditional cartoons from the onset. The Flintstones was originally oriented at parents, as an animated version of The Honeymooners, though it was primarily popular with children. David Bennett argued that when it was originally released, it was aimed at an adult audience, and called it the ""direct ancestors"" of current adult animation, because it covered adult subjects. Bennett stated that it specifically influenced The Simpsons, along with animations on Adult Swim and Netflix. His argument was confirmed by the fact that The Huckleberry Hound Show, created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, became a ""surprise hit with adult audiences."" Even though some argued that The Flintstones later influenced The Simpsons, other scholars said that although the show caused a boom in primetime animation and ""subverted conventional TV"", the result would be driving animation out of primetime ""for almost three decades"". Despite this, scholar John Libbey argued that the show utilized ""subversive qualities of animation.""
From 1972 to 1974, Hanna-Barbera produced Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of All in the Family. The series dealt with subjects such as feminism and the generation gap.


=== The Simpsons and expansion of the genre ===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of animated television programs appeared which challenged the Standards & Practices guidelines, including The Simpsons, Beavis and Butt-Head, The Critic, The Brothers Grunt, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Rocko's Modern Life, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel, SpongeBob SquarePants, Duckman, and All Grown Up!. In 1987, The Simpsons shorts debuted on Fox's The Tracey Ullman Show. This show aired in prime time, meaning it was not self-censored as much as programs intended to air on Saturday mornings. As such, the show would have brief nudity and mild language, while dealing with mature themes and subjects such as death, gambling addiction, religion, and suicide. The first full-length episode, ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"", debuted on December 17, 1989. It is the first American animated sitcom not to have a laugh track, unlike other animated sitcoms prior. It remained the sole English-language mainstream adult-oriented animated sitcom until the 1990s, which saw the debuts of Beavis and Butt-Head, King of the Hill, South Park, Daria, Family Guy and Futurama. Some scholars argued that Matt Groening emulated the sci-fi genre shown in The Jetsons. Futurama would be complimented for its ""intelligent, scientifically accurate, and humanized"" approach to adventures, romances, and parodies of sci-fi. This included the growing relationship between Fry and Leela and an ""alien relationship"" (Kif and Amy).
John Evershed, formerly showrunner on Happy Tree Friends and current founder of Mondo Media, argued that the ""enduring popularity"" of this genre is a result of The Simpsons, a massive ""animation franchise,"" and said this proves ""the time-tested formula"" of the genre works, even though it was ""controversial"" when it was released. Evershed also said that the show made clear that animation is ""more than just kids content."" Others also argued that the show marked a turning point in U.S. attitudes ""toward cartoons written primarily for adult audiences"" The Simpsons would later win the Guinness World Records award for ""Longest-running animated sitcom (by episode count)."" Chris Turner, author of Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation, argued that culture and events of 1990s ""can all be understood through a Simpsons prism.""  Some critics argued that The Simpsons was responsible for ""popularizing adult animation"" while influencing ""satirical cartoons"" like South Park and Family Guy. Others even said that The Simpsons opened the ""door for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim"" and praised it for being ""extremely unique and ... constantly evolving."" Andrew J. Crow of Time magazine noted the influence of The Simpsons on adult animation, with Family Guy, King of the Hill, and Bob's Burgers, among others, featuring some version of the same structure, while ""non-family-based shows"" have drawn from ""Matt Groening's hyper-referential style, irreverence and slapstick humor."" He quoted Alex Hirsch, creator of Gravity Falls, as describing adult animation as an ""arms race of different ways to copy The Simpsons."" Two of Hirsch's friends from CalArts, Pendleton Ward (creator of Adventure Time) and J. G. Quintel (creator of Regular Show) were also inspired by The Simpsons. In 1989, The Simpsons began airing on Fox Broadcasting Company in prime time, becoming a massive hit among American audiences. In response, ABC, CBS and NBC each developed animated series to air in prime time, but none of the shows were successful. One series, Capitol Critters, focused on subjects such as gun control, interracial violence and political corruption. In his review of the series, Variety critic Brian Lowry wrote that he felt that the series' approach was ""muddled"", and that ""the bland central character and cartoonish elements ... will likely be off-putting to many adults, who won't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention. Similarly, kids probably won't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look"". The series was cancelled after one month. The Critic was somewhat more successful, but achieved low ratings because of ABC's sporadic scheduling, and was cancelled by the network. Fox picked up the series, but cancelled it four months later.  While Fox allowed The Simpsons to portray animated depictions of human buttocks, ABC would not allow similar scenes to appear on The Critic.
Others stated that it was not until the early 1990s that ""cartoons specifically for adults"" rather than children, did not come to ""mainstream prominence"" until after the success of The Simpsons, with Fox later airing King of the Hill and Family Guy both of which ""generated massive audiences."" As animation critic Reuben Baron described it, for a long time, ""adult action/drama cartoons"" were scarce on television, with only a ""few cult hits and flops in the '90s"", with almost nothing in the 2000s and more in the 2010s. Some critics called Duckman, based on a comic of the same, a ""Simpsons-inspired sitcom"" which had a pilot in 1991 and premiered in 1994 on the USA Network as part of the ""network's Saturday night programming."" The show features humans, animals, and hybrids of both intermingling, with ""every design intentionally exaggerated and distorted"", looking like the original comics, with theme music from Frank Zappa and set its sights on ""1990s incarnations of political correctness and censorship"", making it, a critic argued, a precursor to Family Guy and BoJack Horseman. As for King of the Hill, some noted it had the a great example of ""young, adolescent love"" within adult animation, specifically between Bobby and Connie. The show was also described as a ""force for adult animation."" In 1999, Family Guy debuted on Fox. The series was cancelled twice in the first three years, but became one of the network's longest-running series. It would later be praised for its humor, ""cynical commentary, and sci-fi adventures"" while having a sincere but tragic and real relationship between Brian and Pearl Burton.
Beavis and Butt-Head, which began airing in the early 1990s, another sitcom, was also controversial. This was due to its portrayal of brief nudity, profanity and violence. Although the series was intended for adult audiences, it was shown in the afternoons, and multiple parents claimed that their children had imitated the show's characters. After an incident, MTV responded by moving the series to a later airtime and adding disclaimers to future episodes stating explicitly not to imitate the actions of the characters, as well as removing all references to fire from the episodes.  As Beavis and Butt-Head began entered its last season in 1997, a new adult animation began airing on MTV which was titled Daria. It would praised for its ""progressive characters"", sense of humor, and ability to capture absurdity of teen life in suburbs. Beginning around the same time was South Park. It became an ""icon for anti-censorship and free speech"" and was called ""one of the most controversial shows on television.""
In May 1995, another adult animated sitcom began airing on Comedy Central. It was titled Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, featured the voice talents of Jonathan Katz, Jon Benjamin, and Laura Silverman, won a Peabody Award in 1998. and was animated in a crude, easily recognizable style produced with the software Squigglevision in which all persons and animate objects are colored and have constantly squiggling outlines, while most other inanimate objects are static and usually gray in color. Some critics stated that this series offered ""plenty of cleverness and humor for those who looked"", with funny lines, a unique style, and centered around ""therapist discussions with real celebrities"".

=== In the 2000s ===
In March 2000, the first few episodes of God, the Devil and Bob aired on NBC, with nine episodes unaired. The series didn't return until 2011, when the nine remaining episodes aired, from January to March 2011, on Adult Swim. Some said this was because Christian groups, like the American Family Association, had boycotted the network, and 17 NBC-affiliated stations agreed, leading to the show being stopped only after four episodes had aired. Even so, some religious leaders in the United Kingdom supported the show, and critics like Caryn James called it ""a little risky"" but ""relatively benign"" when compared to South Park, The Sopranos, and Sex and the City which aired at the time.
In June 2000, Kevin Smith criticized ABC over its animated sitcom, Clerks: The Animated Series, telling EW that they delivered the content but that ABC, and their corporate owner Disney Company, reneged on their promises, and called the show ""dead"" even though there were six episodes that had not aired. Six episodes of the show, based on Kevin Smith's 1994 comedy of the same title, were produced, but only two episodes aired before the show was cancelled by ABC.
While the pilot of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law first aired as a sneak peek on Cartoon Network on December 30, 2000, the series officially premiered on Adult Swim on September 2, 2001, the night the block launched. It ended on July 22, 2007, with a total of 39 episodes, over the course of four seasons. Later, in October 2018, a special, entitled Harvey Birdman: Attorney General, premiered, and a spin-off, Birdgirl, was ordered in May 2019. Some described the series as funny, entertaining, zany, and amusing.
From August to October 2002, the final few episodes of The Oblongs, another adult animation, would air on Adult Swim after The WB did not air the last five episodes of the series. The latter, which some called a ""stray gem in the early 2000s,"" was noted for the romance between a married couple, Bob and Pickles Oblong, who had a healthy relationship where both would ""constantly support each other."" In 2008, Usha M. Rodrigues and Belinda Smaill argued that bro'Town was a ""home grown animated sitcom"" that is comparable to The Simpsons.

Adult animation became more popular, premiering critically acclaimed shows such as Drawn Together, Family Guy, American Dad!, Archer, Bob's Burgers, Rick and Morty, BoJack Horseman, F Is for Family, and Big Mouth. Some argued that animated sitcoms have formed some of the ""most enduring and valuable franchises in the history of television,"" in terms of shows like Family Guy and South Park. These shows, and their subsequent franchises, were said to be part of a shift in the early 2010s toward adult animation, with darker and ""more intricate animated comedies"" such as Bojack Horseman and Rick and Morty released, with the latter reaching nine million viewers after the first season. Drawn Together, a parody of The Real World, which follows the misadventures of the housemates in the fictional show of the same name and uses a sitcom format with a reality TV show setting, was followed by a direct-to-video film and series finale titled The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!. Another antimated sitcom was 
Brickleberry which aired on Comedy Central from 2012 to 2015. It was created by Waco O'Guin and Roger Black, executive produced by O'Guin, Black, and comedian Daniel Tosh. It was later described as one of the ""more vulgar adult-animation offerings"" of the 2010s, with Kaitlin Olson only staying ""for the first season as the female lead,"" voicing a ""recently transferred Yellowstone ranger named Ethel."" It was also said that show had a divided reception from critics but received favorably by audiences, who appreciated the show's ""shameless sense of offensive humor and fast-paced writing.""
Archer was said to be a ""standard bearer"" for adult animation and an ""eclectic comedy"" and praised for its ""tight, fast-paced, and ever impressively intelligent dialogue,"" with a ""power couple"": Sterling Archer and Lana Kane. American Dad! was praised for breaking away from the ""cynicism and formulas of its adult animation contemporaries"" with the romance between Stan Smith and Francine said to be a wonderful romantic pair akin to Archie and Edith Bunker. Bob's Burgers was described as a welcome addition to the ""Sunday lineup,"" with passionate relationship between Bob and Linda Belcher while maintaining a large audience. In November 2020, the show was approaching its 200th episode. and that  Some reviewers called Drawn Together a ""bizarre and highly entertaining series"" which has a unique style of humor and ""level of self-parody."" Some reviewers would point to how the ""foxhole humor"" in Bob's Burgers has kept it going, and even argue that the humor in the children's animation, Animaniacs was ""far more adult"" than the original series in the 1990s. Later in 2020, the reboot of Animaniacs, an all-ages animation had an episode pulled which included a real sex hotline number, with the series no stranger to adult humor as the showrunner, Wellesley Wild, is a ""veteran of adult animation"" as he worked on Family Guy in the past.


=== In the 2010s ===
In June 2011, two scholars analyzed queer characters and themes in animated sitcoms, arguing that they create ""space for queer resistance,"" analyzing themes, and text, in the animated series Family Guy. They also argued that analyzing the show using postmodern thematic analysis, it creates ""deconstructionist instances"" that, in their view, ""expose and subvert the hegemony of heteronormativity.""
Allen Gregory had a short run in 2011 and was cancelled after the first season.  This series featured Richard and Jeremy De Longpre, the fathers of the title character, Allen. Jeremy is a former social worker who had a loving wife and family, although this changed after Richard became one of his clients. Richard was attracted to Jeremy to the point where he started stalking him and his family until Jeremy finally agreed to be his husband. It is said that Jeremy is actually heterosexual but left his wife and children for Richard, who offered him an easy, no-maintenance life as his trophy husband. 
The following year, from January to December 2012, Unsupervised, an adult animated sitcom ran on FX. Although it was cancelled in November 2012 after one season, it was praised by critics as a coming-of-age story, with two clueless and ridiculous protagonists, while having ""realistic looking backgrounds,"" contrasting with show's look in general.
Jeff & Some Aliens, an animated sitcom aired on Comedy Central from January to March 2017. The plot surrounds three aliens who travel to Earth to find the most average person to test and understand humans. Most episodes revolve around Jeff having a problem that the aliens can fix with a strange device. In December 2017, the series was canceled after one season. It was described as being ""a witty and fun stoner alien romp"" which is a comedy akin to Rick and Morty.

Other animated sitcoms include Paradise PD, Tuca & Bertie, The Boondocks,  and Momma Named Me Sheriff. Some series are on streaming platforms, as is the case with Disenchantment, Final Space, Solar Opposites, Central Park, the short-lived series, Hoops, and Q-Force. This positioned Netflix as a leader of adult animation content. The creator of Bojack Horseman, Raphael Bob-Waksberg, said that the show is about ""ourselves looking outwards"" and argued that the voice actor for Bojack, Will Arnett, can find the comedy in anything. Nasdaq argued that shows like Disenchantment were ""original content"" which had helped Netflix ""dominate the online video streaming market,"" and said that demand for original content will allow Netflix to expand its base of subscribers. This allowed Netflix to gain allegiance of smaller, but more fervent, fanbases, which garnered a wide viewership.
Some critics noted that The Simpsons is not the only model for such animation, due to new shows coming to TV and streaming platforms like BoJack Horseman, Big Mouth, Rick and Morty and Undone, which some call a boom at the time that ""high-quality adult animation shows"" are being produced in France, Japan, and in other parts of the world, a new group of creators is pushing existing boundaries. Even so, fans of The Simpsons turned Hulu into a popular streaming hub.
Critics praised Tuca & Bertie and Solar Opposites for their take on humor and comedy. Shaurya Thapa of Screen Rant argued that Tuca & Bertie offered ""a fresh and realistic take on the sitcom formula"" while Rafael Motomoyer of Collider argued that Solar Opposites not only mixes ""crude humor and knack for violence ... with a long-standing tradition of animated sitcoms"" centered on a family, but it gives a ""new take on the typical American family."" Some described The Boondocks as profound, comedic, smart, silly, has social commentary on class relations, racism, and with a unique animation style. Some said that Apple TV+'s Central Park was one of the best shows of 2020 and described it as the network's ""first foray into adult animation.""
Certain comedians have created their own animated sitcoms. This includes the ongoing series, Duncanville, is airing on FOX, co-created by Amy Poehler, Mike Scully, and Julie Thacker. Poehler said the series is inspired by The Simpsons. Another animated sitcom on Fox, Bless the Harts, starred Kristen Wiig, and was created by former Saturday Night Live staff writer, Emily Spivey.
A September 2018 report by AT&T, using Google Trends, identified the most popular animated sitcoms in each U.S. state. They found that South Park is popular in Colorado, The Simpsons is popular in Oregon and Massachusetts, Family Guy popular in Connecticut, and King of the Hill popular in Kentucky and Tennessee. The report also stated The Simpsons and South Park are the two most popular animated sitcoms, while Rick and Morty is among the ""most watched cable television series.""
In 2019, it was announced that a writer for Disenchantment, Shion Takeuchi, would be heading her own upcoming Netflix show titled Inside Job, with Alex Hirsch as an executive producer, With a woman named Alma as the protagonist, Takeuchi said she hoped it would ""push the boundaries"" of adult animation. Hirsch was also quoted as noting that adult animation is changing, saying that it can be something that is ""sophisticated, dramatic, beautiful and nuanced"" rather than ""crass and cruel.""


=== 2020s to present ===
In January 2020, TZGZ, Syfy's new adult animation block, ordered six 15-minute episodes of the series, which would later become Magical Girl Friendship Squad. At the same time, the short form version, Magical Girl Friendship Squad: Origins, began airing on the same late-night programming block.
In February 2020, Fox released an animated sitcom produced by Seungyong Ji and Jordan Grief titled Duncanville, focusing on the story of a kid who ""daydreams of making it big without having to wear a suit and tie to do so.""
In September 2020, Magical Girl Friendship Squad began airing on SYFY. In interviews the same month, series creator Kelsey Stephanides hoped that  the series would expand the ""types of new animated stories"" with more variety in adult animation, allowing for ""different ways"" to do adult animation in the future.
In December 2020, Hoops was cancelled by Netflix after its first season received low ratings and negative reviews. Hoops was described as ""puerile comedy ... perfect for Trump's America,"" not funny, and ""crude, rude, and aimless.""
On January 15, 2021, the first part of season 2 of Disenchantment was released on Netflix. In February 2021, it was announced that Tyler, the Creator had teamed up with Lionel Boyce and Davon 'Jasper' Wilson to develop an animated comedy named Shell Beach. In March 2021 it was reported that King of the Hill would be revived, with characters aging 15 years from the end of the series.

Chlorocardium rodiei,"Chlorocardium rodiei (greenheart) is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is one of two species in the genus Chlorocardium. It is native to Guyana and Suriname in South America. Other common names include cogwood, demerara greenheart, greenhart, ispingo moena, sipiri, bebeeru and bibiru.
It is an evergreen tree growing 15 to 30 m tall with a trunk diameter of 35 to 60 cm. The leaves are oppositely arranged and simple with smooth edges. The fruit is a drupe containing a single seed.

The cyclic bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid rodiasine was first isolated from this species. The wood is extremely hard and strong, so hard that it cannot be worked with standard tools. It is durable in marine conditions, so it is used to build docks and other structures, and it was an early choice for fly fishing rods. An estimated 15 to 28% of the original population has been harvested. The species' use as a commercial timber began in the late 18th century, but most of the harvesting has taken place since the introduction of chainsaws in 1967.
It is often sought for construction projects in parts of the Caribbean, where wood ants are problematic in conventional pine wood construction. It was also used to build the dock gates in Liverpool, such as the Manchester dock gate. It has been used extensively as marine piling, since it is highly resistant to marine borers. It is also extremely dense, and does not float, therefore requiring special water transport arrangement, and is loaded onto specially constructed pontoons for transport to sawmill or direct shipping overseas. As sawn lumber it requires special treatment, and saws with tungsten carbide teeth, since standard steel saw blades cannot be maintained sharp enough to cut any reasonable quantity.

Art valuation,"Art valuation, an art-specific subset of financial valuation, is the process of estimating the market value of works of art. As such, it is more of a financial rather than an aesthetic concern, however, subjective views of cultural value play a part as well. Art valuation involves comparing data from multiple sources such as art auction houses, private and corporate collectors, curators, art dealer activities, gallerists (gallery owners), experienced consultants, and specialized market analysts to arrive at a value. Art valuation is accomplished not only for collection, investment, divestment, and financing purposes, but as part of estate valuations, for charitable contributions, for tax planning, insurance, and loan collateral purposes. This article deals with the valuation of works of fine art, especially contemporary art, at the top end of the international market, but similar principles apply to the valuation of less expensive art and antiques.


== Historic valuation and contemporary art ==
The source of a work's artistic charisma has long been debated between artists who create and patrons who enable, but the charismatic power of artworks on those who would possess them is historically the initial driver of value. In the 1960s that charismatic power started edging over to accommodate commercialized culture and a new industry of art, when aesthetic value fell from prominence to parity with Pop art and Andy Warhol's idea of business art, a recognition that art has become a business and making money in business is an art. One of many artists to follow Warhol is Jeff Koons, a stockbroker turned artist who also borrowed imagery from popular culture and made millions.
For collectors, the emotional connection felt toward a work or collection creates subjective personal value. The weight assigned by such a collector to that subjective measure as a portion of a work's overall financial value may be greater than that by an art speculator not sharing the collector's emotional investment, however, non-economic value measures such as ""Do I like it?"" or ""Does it speak to me?"" still have economic effect because such measures can be deciding factors in a purchase.
In contrast, the Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA) suggests that the key issues are authenticity, quality, rarity, condition, provenance and value.


== Valuing art ==

Art valuation activity concerns itself with estimating market demand, estimating liquidity capability of lots, works, and artists, the condition and provenance of works, and with valuation trends such as average sale price and mean estimates. As with other markets, the art market uses its own industry-specific terms of art or vocabulary, for example, ""bought-in"", describing the disadvantageous situation occurring when a work or lot at auction is returned to its owner having been passed over, withdrawn or otherwise unsold. Valuing art is also necessary when a piece is to be used as collateral. The art-lending market has expanded to an estimated $15 billion to $19 billion of loans outstanding in the USA.  The shift in Asia towards investment in western art is a factor that has allowed art lending companies to launch offices in Asia as western works are often easier to use as collateral.


=== Market demand ===
As in the housing market, ""comparables"" are used to determine what level of demand similar items have in a current market. The freshness of the comparables is important because the art market is fluid and stale comparables will yield estimates that may have little relation to a work's current value. Subject matter and the medium of a work also affect market demand, as does rarity.


=== Liquidity ===
Liquidity in the art market means having artworks in very high demand and being able to sell those works without impediment. Art sales slow in downturns resulting in the market becoming more illiquid. There is a greater degree of liquidity risk facing the art investor than with other financial assets because there is a limited pool of potential buyers, and with artworks not reaching their reserve prices and not being sold, this has an effect on the auction prices. In a divorce action between a couple who sought to divide a $102 million collection between them, the couple decided a sale would prove problematic because selling the entire collection and dividing the profit would saturate the market and drive down prices; in reporting on the case, The Seattle Times described the case as a study on how people measure the value of art, and which counts for more — pragmatism or sentiment. The newspaper reported that one of the two litigants had a more sentimental view of the value of the works, while the other had a more businesslike view, wanting balance and diversification. The newspaper attempted to calculate the value of the many artworks at issue in the case by determining a per-square-inch price based on each piece's value divided by its dimension, to end up with a per-square-inch price to apply to the amount of wall space the businesslike litigant wanted to cover with the available art. The Times ultimately concluded that using this formula as between the litigants, John Singer Sargent's Dans les Oliviers à Capri was valued at $26,666.67 per square inch, that the sentimental litigant received $3,082 of appraised value per square inch while the businesslike litigant received $1,942 per square inch, but could cover more wall space.


=== Valuation trends ===
Trends for values from the world's top auction houses are compared for study of market direction and how that direction affects given artists and works. Valuations for art sold at the market's top houses usually carry more weight than valuations from less established houses, as most of the top houses have hundreds of years of experience.
Long term economic trends can have a great impact on the valuation of certain types of work. In recent decades the values of historic Russian and Chinese art have greatly benefited from increased wealth in those countries creating new and very rich collectors, as the values of Orientalist and Islamic art had earlier been boosted by oil wealth in the Arab world.


=== Participant activity ===
One of many factors in the primary market's price of a living artist's work is a dealer's contract with an artist: many dealers, as stakeholders in their artists' success, agree to buy their own stable of artists' work at auction in order to prevent price drops, to maintain price stability, or to increase perceived value, or all three, thus dealers bidding on their own artists at auction have a direct impact on the selling price for those artists' works and as a result, the valuation of those works.


=== Research data ===
Research data available from art auction houses such as Christie's, Sotheby's, Phillips, Bonhams, and Lyon & Turnbull are those tracking market trends such as yearly lot transactions, bought-in statistics, sales volume, price levels, and pre-auction estimates.  There are also companies such as ArtTactic utilizing art auction data as providers of art market research analysis. Information available from internet-based art sale history databases generally does not include the condition of a work, a very important factor, therefore the prices quoted in those databases reflect auction hammer prices without other, crucial valuation factors. Additionally, the databases of auctioned work do not cover private sales of works, and thus their use for art valuation is but one source among many needed for determining value.


=== General valuation factors ===
Valuation estimates by auction houses are typically given in ranges of prices to offset uncertainty. Generally, estimates are made by looking at what a comparable piece of art sold for recently, with estimates given in a range of prices rather than one fixed figure, and in the case of contemporary art especially, having few comparables or when an artist is not well known and has no auction history, the risks of incorrect valuation are greatest.
One potential factor in valuation are the seller's reasons for selling a particular work and/or the buyer's reasons for buying, neither of which may have anything to do with the other. For example, a seller may be motivated by financial need, boredom with a particular artwork, or the desire to raise funds for a different purchase. Common motivations include the so-called three D's: death, debt and divorce. Buyers may be motivated by market excitement, may be acting in accord with a collection plan, or buying like buyers of stock: to drive value up or down either for themselves or for another person.
One method for pricing pieces by new artists of uncertain value is to ignore aesthetics and consider, besides market trends, three semi-commoditized aspects: ""scale"" - size and level of detail, ""intensity"" - effort, and ""medium"" - quality of the materials.
Valuing artworks in such a specialized market, therefore, takes into account a wide variety of factors, some indeed in conflict with each other.


== Valuation for tax and other law-related purposes ==
In the United States, art bought and sold by collectors is treated as a capital asset for tax purposes, and disputes relating to the valuation of art or the nature of gain on its sale are usually decided by the federal Tax Court, and sometimes by other courts applying federal tax law to specific cases.


=== Important U.S. cases ===
Crispo Gallery v. Commissioner (need to produce credible documentary evidence of valuation as taxpayer has ultimate burden of persuasion),
Angell v. Commissioner (fraud perpetuated upon the IRS through inflated appraisals),
Drummond v. Commissioner (cannot claim gain from art sale as income from business unless actually in the business),
Estate of Querbach v. A & B Appraisal Serv. (appraiser's liability for misidentifying a painting),
Estate of Robert Scull v. Commissioner (previous sales of the same property without subsequent events affecting value are generally strong indicators of fair market value),
Nataros v. Fine Arts Gallery of Scottsdale (in the absence of fraud or negligent misrepresentation, buyers believing they have overpaid at auction because of bad advice bear a heavy burden of proof),
Williford v. Commissioner (the 'Williford Factors' test: eight factors to determine whether property is held for investment or held for sale).

Charenton Metro-Viaduct,"The Charenton Metro-Viaduct is a railroad girder bridge located in the French department of Val-de-Marne in the Île-de-France region. It links the communes of Charenton-le-Pont and Maisons-Alfort, crossing the Marne river, as well as the A4 autoroute and 103 departmental road. First put into operation in 1970, the viaduct is used by trains on line 8 of the Paris metro.
The total length of the viaduct is 199 m. Made up of steel beams resting on concrete piers, the viaduct has a continuous gradient, due to the difference in level between the two banks of the Marne. It was renovated for the first time in 2011.


== Location ==
The viaduct is located between the Charenton-Écoles and Maisons-Alfort–Stade stations. It crosses the 103 departmental road, the A4 autoroute and then the Marne. Since Charenton-le-Pont is located on a hillside overlooking the Marne, the viaduct is inclined to compensate for the difference in level between the two stations. The structure is flanked by two tramways, enabling line 8 to return underground.
The surrounding bridges are the Charenton bridge, to the east, and the railway viaduct of the Paris–Marseille railway, to the west. The structure is only a few hundred meters away from the confluence of the Marne and Seine rivers.


== Technical specifications ==

The total length of the viaduct is 199 m, with an average height of 15.05 m between the rail and the water level. The structure has a continuous gradient of 41 mm/m towards Maisons-Alfort. It comprises two 55.5 m central sections and two 30 m lateral sections. The structure rests on six supports for three concrete piles, one of which is set in the riverbed.
The steel deck is designed to aesthetically blend into the landscape. It consists of a continuous beam supported by two vertical solid-core girders located between the two tracks. By enclosing the lower part of the trains, they minimize rolling noise. The track rests on ballast, which is laid on a concrete screed.


== History ==

With the Charenton bridge becoming too saturated, in 1965 it was decided to extend line 8 from Charenton-Écoles to Maisons-Alfort and Créteil. To achieve this, the line had to cross the Marne, but the difference in level between the two banks was too great to allow the line to pass under the river, as Charenton was located on a highland plateau. Instead, an elevated viaduct crossing was chosen – a first for a Paris metro since 1909.
This extension, which had been planned as early as the 1930s, had been postponed due to World War II. In anticipation of the metro's construction, buildings in Charenton's Rue de Paris were expropriated in 1937, including the Hôtel du Plessis-Bellière. The upper part of Square Jules Noël and Place de Valois, as well as the buildings lining it, were built to replace the destroyed buildings.

Construction of the viaduct began in the spring of 1968, with the construction of the piers. The steel girders were installed in June 1969, and the viaduct was completed in November, enabling load tests to be carried out using five-motor Sprague-Thomson trains. The line was opened to traffic on 19 September 1970, with the extension of line 8 from Charenton-Écoles to Maisons-Alfort-Stade.
In the context of the extension of line 8 to Pointe du Lac, the viaduct was closed for renovations during the summers of 2010 and 2011, with a replacement shuttle service in place during this period. The aim of the renovation is to improve the soundproofing of the structure and adapt it to the increased traffic associated with the extension. After the removal of the tracks and ballast, the concrete slab was replaced and then covered with an anti-vibration rubber coating, reducing noise levels by 10 dB per train. At the same time, the viaduct was repainted in a blue-green color, replacing the original blue-gray. The total cost of the project was four million euros.

Analytic theology,"Analytic Theology (AT) is a body of primarily Christian theological literature resulting from the application of the methods and concepts of late-twentieth-century analytic philosophy.
Analytic theology is related to the philosophy of religion. Given the types of historical philosophy that have funded the analytic philosophy of religion, theologians are frequently involved in retrieval theology as they re-appropriate and modify older Christian solutions to theological questions. Analytic theology has strong roots in the Anglo-American analytic philosophy of religion in the last quarter of the twentieth century, as well as similarities at times to scholastic approaches to theology.


== Definition ==
Historically and methodologically, AT is both a way of approaching theological works as well as a sociological or historical shift in academic theology. AT can be identified by its analytic method; its focus on a wider range of theological topics than the philosophy of religion; and an engagement with the wider analytic philosophical or theological literature for concepts. Ideas such as speech-act theory or possible world semantics have been applied to theological questions involving divine revelation or foreknowledge.
When understood more 'widely', analytic theology is a method to be applied to theological works. Muslims, Jews and Christians could all apply the same analytic methods to their theological work. William Wood has called this the ""formal model"" of analytic theology. By contrast, some wonder if analytic theology is forwarding certain theological beliefs. In contrast to the formal method, Wood calls this the ""substantive model"" of analytic theology.


=== Differences to other disciplines ===
In a 2013 article of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Andrew Chignell notes that some of the reviewers and writers in the 2009 Analytic Theology edited volume wondered what the difference, if any, was between analytic theology and philosophical theology. Similarly, Max Baker-Hytch, a philosopher of religion, asked what the difference between AT and the analytic philosophy of religion was in an article in the Journal of Analytic Theology. 
The difference between AT and systematic theology is currently under debate. William Abraham argues that AT is systematic theology and that it was only a matter of time before something like AT took root in the theological world. Oliver Crisp has published an article demonstrating how analytic theology could qualify itself as systematic theology. Oliver Crisp cites leading theologians to demonstrate that there is no agreed upon definition for systematic theology. He shows how AT shares a common task and goals with systematic theology. 


=== As a theological method ===
Due to its similarities to philosophical theology and philosophy of religion and overlap with analytic philosophy, defining analytic theology remains a challenge. Systematic theologian William J. Abraham defined analytic theology as ""systematic theology attuned to the deployment of the skills, resources, and virtues of analytic philosophy. It is the articulation of the central themes of Christian teaching illuminated by the best insights of analytic philosophy.""
Philosopher Michael Rea defines analytic theology as activities of approaching theological topics that involve ""style that conforms to the prescriptions that are distinctive of analytic philosophical discourse"", such as following the jargons of analytic philosophy. An effort to tentatively illustrate some rhetorical features that characterized analytic philosophy was made by Rea in the introduction to Analytic Theology. Imagine, for example, that a theologian writes that Jesus's cry of dereliction from the cross indicates that the Trinity was broken or ruptured mysteriously during Jesus's crucifixion. An analytic theologian might ask for what ""broken"" denotes given its connotations when used about the God of Christianity. The analytic theologian might turn to the history in search of concepts that help her speak about Christ being ""forsaken"" by God.
Cambridge theologian Sarah Coakley, by contrast, warns that attempts to set down an essentialist definition for analytic theology will distract from the productive work of AT. 


=== Sociologically and historically ===
Andrew Chignell has offered a different definition of AT: ""Analytic theology is a new, concerted, and well-funded effort on the part of philosophers of religion, theologians, and religion scholars to re-engage and learn from one another, instead of allowing historical, institutional, and stylistic barriers to keep them apart."" Chignell mentions at least two edited volumes that attempted to bring together philosophers, theologians and scholars of religion to work on questions they had in common.


== History ==

Contemporary AT, represented by scholars like Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea, has its roots in mid-twentieth-century responses by Christian philosophers to challenges of religious epistemology and religious language about God, and then a turn by Christian philosophers to work on more traditionally theological topics. In Medieval Europe, a tradition of philosophical thought of theology was brought into decline by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher.


=== 1950s ===
By the 1950s, the conversation mostly shifted to require speakers to show why theological or philosophical claims were true or false. According to Nicholas Wolterstorff, the demise of logical positivism also had the effect of casting doubt over other attempts, such as those of Kant or the logical positivists, to point out a deep epistemological boundary between the knowable and unknowable. Wolterstorff also suggests that classical foundationalism collapsed as the theory of epistemology in philosophy, but it was not replaced by an alternative theory. What has resulted was an environment of dialogical pluralism where no major epistemological framework is widely held.
In this context of dialogical pluralism, two mechanisms for justifying holding a belief became popular: reformed epistemology and evidentialist approaches that made use of Bayesian probability. 


=== 1970s to present ===
In 1978, the Society of Christian Philosophers was formed. Six years later, Alvin Plantinga delivered his presidential addresses, ""Advice to Christian Philosophers"", in which he signaled the need for Christian philosophers to do more than follow the assumptions and approaches to philosophy accepted in the wider field, given that many of those assumptions were antithetical to Christianity.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the production of literature by Christian philosophers became more about treating theological topics such as the attributes of God and atonement by scholars like Richard Swinburne and his fellow Orielense David Brown. According to Swinburne, Brown's book, The Divine Trinity, was ""the first book in the 'analytic' philosophy of religion tradition to analyse a central Christian doctrine"". Both Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea found that philosophers and theologians were not sharing resources as late as the mid-2000s.

It was with the publication of Analytic Theology that AT began to garner attention in philosophical and theological circles. In 2012, a session at the American Academy of Religion (AAR) was dedicated to discussing the volume, followed by several articles in volume 81 of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion. In 2013, the Journal of Analytic Theology was first published.


== Projects ==
There are several centers of study where analytic theology is being worked on in a departmental setting, including the Fuller Theological Seminary, the Logos Institute at St. Andrews University, the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame, Oriel College at Oxford and the University of Innsbruck.
The John Templeton Foundation had funded analytic theology-type projects in North America, at the University of Notre Dame's Center for Philosophy of Religion; in Europe, at the Munich School of Philosophy and University of Innsbruck; and in the Middle East, at the Shalem Center and then later the Herzl Institute in Jerusalem. More recent Templeton-funded initiatives include a three-year project at Fuller Theological Seminary in California and the establishment of the Logos Institute for Analytic and Exegetical Theology at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.

Voxel art,"Voxel art is a digital art form which is similar to pixel art. Instead of coloring squares, cubes are colored. Voxel art is especially popular in revamps of old video games[1][2], and also in Minecraft and other cube sandboxes. Voxel art is made with special software called a voxel editor.

Furry,"A furry is a person who is interested in or creates fictional anthropomorphic animal characters who have human traits. This group of people make up the furry fandom. Furry characters (called fursonas, especially when referring to someone's personal furry characters) can walk on two legs, talk, or even have human intelligence. Another word for a ""furry character"" is an anthropomorphic character, which means a character which has some human features. but, unlike Anthropomorphism however, Anthropomorphism is also utilized for objects and much more too.
Many different stories have furry characters. Fairy tales and mythology often have animal characters who talk or do other human things. Books, comics, children's books, video games, and toys can have furry characters too. The most popular cartoon character that is a furry is Disney's Robin Hood.
Sometimes, people draw porn of furry characters to fit their sexual interests. Quite a few people believe this represents a large part of the furry fandom, and it gains significant news attention. There is a common misconception about furries, being that furries also have sex with animals. That is not true for most in the furry community, despite how many people believe it. More information on that in the “Sexuality” section.


== What is Furry? ==
Things that make furry people different from other animals in stories:

Animals that are just as smart as (if not smarter than) people
Animals that act like people by smiling or other displays of feelings
Animals that can talk like people
Animals that walk on two legs like people
Animals that wear clothes that look like people's clothes, like t-shirts and pants.
Stories about people who can turn into animals, like werewolves (wolf-men), are considered furry as well. 


== Fursona traits ==
To have a fursona or furry character, that animal needs to look or act like a human in some way. Here are some of the ways:

Talking
Showing their feelings like humans do, by smiling and frowning
Walking on two legs
Wearing clothes
Living in houses or working at jobs
Having Human Intelligence
It's also important to say here that there's also ""feral"" sections of the fandom. They focus more on the animal aspects of the character, and most feral furry characters don't talk or do many human activities.
Not all of these features have to be on a fursona for it to be a furry character. Some furry characters can be thought of as ""fursonas"" without walking on their hind legs or having jobs. An example is a ""quad-fursona,"" where the fursona (Especially transformed into a fursuit) is walking on all fours.
A character does not need to have fur to be a furry. A lizard or bird character that has these features could also be a furry, although they may also be called a ""scalie"" or an ""avian"".


== Furry characters in art ==
Humans are good at reading human body language, but less good at reading animal body language. Art showing animals smiling or frowning like humans makes it easier for humans to know how the character is feeling. 
Because humans have been around animals for a long time, humans expect certain animals to act certain ways. Art that gives animals human traits tells people what to expect from those characters. For example, many cultures see foxes as clever, so many people will assume a fox fursona is clever.
Art in the Furry Fandom is very important, in fact. In order to get a fursuit, you have to submit a reference sheet showing your fursona character at 360 angles. It's also a way to make profit or just show off your skills. At furry conventions, there are auctions, a Dealer's Den (a place to buy products from makers in the fandom), and presentations that have furry or anthropomorphic art in it.
Fursuits are another piece of art in the Furry Fandom, with each one being unique and special!


== Fairy tales and mythology ==
For thousands of years, people have told stories and made art with furry characters. Egyptian mythology has many gods who are part animal and part human. Roman mythology has a story about a minotaur, which is part bull and part human. The werewolf of European mythology is part wolf and part human. There is also Aesop's fables, that usually have animal characters talking in them. 


== Cartoons and video games ==
Many cartoons, shows, and movies have furry characters. Examples include: 

Looney Tunes,
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
Kung Fu Panda,
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. (Though this one has it's own fandom that separate from furries, called the bronies) and
Zootopia.
Many video games also have furry characters. A few examples:

Jak and Daxter,
Ratchet and Clank,
Crash Bandicoot,
Sonic the Hedgehog, and
Star Fox.


== Furry fandom ==
In the modern day, people from all around the world make up the furry fandom. Many of them meet and talk to each other the Internet, but they also meet in real life. Furry websites like FurAffinity and DeviantArt let people share pictures, stories, music, games, and animations that have furry characters. 


=== Fursonas and role-play ===
Furries often make up a ""fursona"", or anthropomorphic animal character to represent themselves in the fandom. Often, but not always, the fursona species is that person's favorite animal. When it's not their favorite animal, it's an animal that represents them the most. These people sometimes talk to each other playing as their fursonas. Role-playing isn't exclusive to furries, but it is a big part of the community. These role-plays usually happen over instant messaging or forums, but sometimes happen in real life, like at furry conventions. 


=== Furry conventions ===
Furries sometimes meet at conventions to talk about their favorite characters, buy art, make friends, and show off their fursuits. These meetings may also have music, dancing, and parties. Conventions are usually held in large hotels, so there is enough room for hundreds or even thousands of people.

The largest furry conventions are Anthrocon, Midwest FurFest, Further Confusion, RainFurrest, Furry Weekend Atlanta, and Eurofurence. Many others happen all around the world each year. 


=== Fursuits and other costumes ===
Some furries dress up in ""fursuits"", which are cosplay costumes that look like their fursona. Fake fur is used to make these costumes, so they can be many different colors. Some fursuits look very much like real animals; other fursuits look like cartoon characters or legendary creatures, such as a fursona having a toony style or fursona species that is fantastical like dragons or unicorns. 
A person who wears a fursuit is called a fursuiter. Fursuits may cover the person's whole body, or just part of it. A fursuit that covers the whole body is called a ""fullsuit."" A suit that covers only part of the body (usually the head, arms, and feet, plus a tail) is called a ""partial suit"" or ""partial."" With a partial suit, the rest of the body is covered with clothes to hide the person inside. a ""quarter suit"" is a suit that covers all parts of the furries body except the torso. 
Fursuits are almost always one-of-a-kind. This is because they are often based off of a person's fursona that they made themselves. Some are made by the person who will wear them, others are made by other people who make them for money. 
People usually wear fursuits for fun. Sometimes people feel less shy in a fursuit because no one can see who they are inside, and only the thing they want to be seen as on the outside. This can make them feel more comfortable dancing, playing, hugging, meeting people, or being silly. People may also wear fursuits to be a mascot for a charity or event, usually one related to animals.
Inside a fursuit, it can be difficult to see and hear. Fursuiters often have a friend called a ""handler"" to help them cross traffic or use stairs. In any weather (especially in hot temperatures), fursuiters must be careful not to overheat. This can lead to heatstroke and heat exhaustion. That's why furries often have water bottles or ez cooldowns padding on them.


=== Slang in the furry fandom ===
Like many groups, the furry fandom has its own slang. ""Murr"" is a word used to show you like something or find it attractive (sometimes sexually). ""Scritching"" is gentle scratching; in the furry fandom, this is a way to show you like someone, like hugging. ""Yiff"" is a slang word for sex, and comes from the sound a fox makes during sex. Not many furries like that slang. A ""fursuit"" is a cosplay costume that looks like a furry character, or ""fursona"". A fursona is an anthropomorphic animal character someone makes up for themselves. The word “snoot” is slang for snout. Furries often ""boop"" snoots; this means gently pushing or tapping a fursuiter or furry's nose, usually done as part of roleplay, as a greeting, or for fun. The word ""beans"" refers to the paw pads of an animal, fursona, or fursuiter. ""Poodling"" is a word used to describe someone showing their skin during partial suiting. A lot of ""graymuzzles"", or older furries are against poodling because it ""breaks the magic"". Breaking the magic means to get out of character while fursuiting. There is also ""Milfurs"", who are furries that have served in the army (Can be any kind of field). Babyfur is something to describe babies or young furies.


== Sexuality ==

Only around 20-30% of furries identify as heterosexual. 28.8% of furries identify as homosexual, 23.4% identify as bisexual, 16.5% identify as pansexual, and 10.5% identify as Asexual. The rest either don't know (5.8%) or identify as something else (4.9%). Around 3.2% of people in furry fandom admit to being sexually attracted to animals, or zoophiles.",0
Soteriology,"Soteriology (; Greek: σωτηρία sōtēria ""salvation"" from σωτήρ sōtēr ""savior, preserver"" and λόγος logos ""study"" or ""word"") is the study of religious doctrines of salvation. Salvation theory occupies a place of special significance in many religions. In the academic field of religious studies, soteriology is understood by scholars as representing a key theme in a number of different religions and is often studied in a comparative context; that is, comparing various ideas about what salvation is and how it is obtained.


== Buddhism ==
Buddhism is devoted primarily to liberation from Duḥkha or suffering by breaking free of samsara, the cycle of compulsory rebirth, by attaining nirvana. Buddhism emphasizes the importance of the individual's meditation practice in this process, and their subsequent liberation from samsara, which is to be enlightened.

Thus, the fundamental reason that the precise identification of these two kinds of clinging to an identity – personal and phenomenal – is considered so important is again soteriological. Through first uncovering our clinging and then working on it, we become able to finally let go of this sole cause for all our afflictions and suffering.
However, the Pure Land traditions of Mahayana Buddhism generally focus on the saving nature of the Celestial Buddha Amitābha. In Mahayana Buddhist eschatology, it is believed that we are currently living in the Latter Day of the Law, a period of 10,000 years where the corrupt nature of the people means the teachings of the Buddha are not listened to. Before this era, the bodhisattva Amitābha made 48 vows, including the vow to accept all sentient beings that called to him, to allow them to take refuge in his Pure land and to teach them the pure dharma. It is therefore considered ineffective to trust in personal meditational and even monastic practices, but to only trust in the primal vow of Amitābha.


== Christianity ==

In Christianity, salvation, also called ""deliverance"" or ""redemption"", is the saving of human beings from sin and its consequences. Variant views on salvation are among the main lines dividing the various Christian denominations, being a point of disagreement between Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism and Protestantism (as well as within Protestantism, notably in the Calvinist–Arminian debate). These lines include conflicting definitions of depravity, predestination, atonement, and most pointedly, justification. Christian soteriology ranges from exclusive salvation: p.123  to universal reconciliation concepts.
Christology plays a key role in debates about soteriology. In Catholic tradition, the Church claims soteriological authority. Martin Luther rejected the soteriological authority of the Church. Against this backdrop, the role of Christ's divinity takes so central a place in the theology of Søren Kierkegaard that it provides the basis for the proposition of Christ's power to save, and so in this way of thinking Christology precedes soteriology. In the debates over the ancient authorities Christ's divinity and power over salvation are interconnected theological concepts.


== Epicurean philosophy ==
More than a century after the establishment of the Garden, the school in which Epicurus taught philosophy, some people in the Roman world were calling Epicurus their Savior. The most prominent soul saved by Epicurus was the Roman Empress Pompeia Plotina. Lucretius, author of De Rerum Natura, also depicts the salvific power of philosophy, and of his Scholarch Epicurus, by employing literary devices like the ""Broken Jar parable"" (where the Scholarch is credited with helping mortals to easily enjoy pleasure), poetry, and imagery.
The salvation of Epicurus has no otherworldly connotations whatsoever. Judging from his Principal Doctrines and Letter to Menoeceus, he salves his disciples from supernatural fears and excessive desires for what is not natural and gives his disciples clear ethical guidelines that lead to happiness. Lucretius says Epicurus has set the boundaries for the limits of nature. His followers in Roman times developed Epicurus into a cultural hero and revered him as the founding figure of his School, and as the first to have developed a fully naturalistic cosmology that emancipated mortals from all fear-based superstition.


== Hinduism ==
Soteriology is discussed in Hinduism through its principle of moksha, also called nirvana or kaivalya. ""In India"", wrote Mircea Eliade, ""metaphysical knowledge always has a soteriological purpose."" Moksha refers to freedom from saṃsāra, the cycle of death and rebirth. There are various principles and practices that can lead to the state of Moksha including the Vedas and the Tantras being the basic scriptures for guidance along with many others like Upanishads, Puranas and more.


== Islam ==

Muslims believe that everyone is responsible for their own actions. So even though Muslims believe that Adam and Hawwa (Eve), the parents of humanity, committed a sin by eating from the forbidden tree and thus disobeyed God, they believe that humankind is not responsible for such an action. They believe that God (Allah) is fair and just and one should request forgiveness from him to avoid being punished for not doing what God asked of them and for listening to Satan. Muslims believe that they, as well as everyone else, are vulnerable to making mistakes and thus they need to seek repentance repeatedly at all times.
Muhammad said, ""By Allah, I seek the forgiveness of Allah and I turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times each day."" (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6307) God wants his servants to repent and forgives them, he rejoices over it, as Muhammad said: ""When a person repents, Allah rejoices more than one of you who found his camel after he lost it in the desert."" (Agreed upon. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6309) Islamic tradition has generally held that it is relatively straightforward to enter Jannah (Paradise). In the Quran, God says: ""If you avoid the great sins you have been forbidden, We shall wipe out your minor misdeeds and let you through the entrance of honor [Paradise].""
However, by direct implication of these tenets and beliefs, Man's nature is spiritually and morally flawed such that he needs salvation from himself. Finding appreciation, forgiveness, and joy in Allah is the only (or best) practice to be saved from this terrible fate of corruption and meaninglessness. al-Tahreem 66:8


== Jainism ==

In Jainism, the soteriological concept is moksha, which is the final gunasthana. The Jain theory explains moksha differently from the similar term found in Hinduism. Moksha is a blissful state of existence of a soul, completely free from the karmic bondage, free from saṃsāra, the cycle of birth and death. It is the highest state of existence of a soul, even higher than the gods living in the heavens. In the state of moksha, a soul enjoys infinite bliss, infinite knowledge and infinite perception. This state is achieved through realisation of self and achieving a completely desireless and unattached state.


== Judaism ==

In contemporary Judaism, redemption (Hebrew ge'ulah) is God's gathering in the people of Israel from their various exiles. This includes the final redemption from the present exile. Judaism does not posit a need for personal salvation in a way analogous to Christianity; Jews do not believe in original sin. Instead, Judaism places greater value on individual morality as defined in the Law and embodied in the Torah—the teaching given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai and sometimes understood to be summarized by the Decalogue (Biblical Hebrew עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדְּבָרִים, ʿĂsereṯ haDəḇārīm, lit. 'The Ten Words'). The tannaitic sage Hillel the Elder taught that the Law could be further compressed into the single maxim popularly known as the Golden Rule: ""That which is hateful to you, do not do unto your fellow"".
In Judaism, salvation is closely related to the idea of redemption, or rescue from the states and circumstances that destroy the value of human existence. God, as the creator of the universe, is the source of all salvation for humanity (provided an individual honors God by observing God's precepts). So, redemption and/or salvation depends on the individual. Furthermore, Judaism stresses that one's salvation cannot be obtained through anyone else, invoking a deity, or believing in any outside power or influence.
Some passages in Jewish religious texts assert that an afterlife exists for neither the good nor evil. For example, the writer of the Book of Ecclesiastes tells the reader: ""The dead know nothing. They have no reward and even the memory of them is lost."" For many centuries, rabbis and Jewish laypeople have often wrestled with such passages.


== Mystery religions ==
In the mystery religions, salvation was less worldly and communal, and more a mystical belief concerned with the continued survival of the individual soul after death. Some savior gods associated with this theme are dying-and-rising gods, often associated with the seasonal cycle, such as Osiris, Tammus, Adonis, and Dionysus. A complex of soteriological beliefs was also a feature of the cult of Cybele and Attis.
The similarity of themes and archetypes to religions found in antiquity to later Christianity has been pointed out by many authors, including the Fathers of the early Christian church. One view is that early Christianity borrowed these myths and motifs from contemporary Hellenistic mystery religions, which possessed ideas such as life-death-rebirth deities and sexual relations between gods and human beings. While Christ myth theory is not accepted by mainstream historians, proponents attempt to establish causal connections to the cults of Mithras, Dionysus, and Osiris among others.


== Sikhism ==
Sikhism advocates the pursuit of salvation through disciplined, personal meditation on the Naam Japo (name) and message of God, meant to bring one into union with God. But a person's state of mind has to be detached from this world, with the understanding that this world is a temporary abode and their soul has to remain untouched by pain, pleasure, greed, emotional attachment, praise, slander, and above all, egotistical pride. Thus their thoughts and deeds become nirmal or pure, and they merge with God or attain union with God, just as a drop of water falling from the skies merges with the ocean.


== Taoism ==
Becoming an enlightened person is what is considered salvation in many Taoist beliefs.
Some Taoist immortals were thought of as deceased humans whose souls achieved a superior physical form. Enlightened people were sometimes called zhenren and thought to be the living embodiment of the supernatural characteristics of the faith.


== Other religions ==
Shinto and Tenrikyo similarly emphasize working for a good life by cultivating virtue or virtuous behavior.
In an age that still saw salvation as primarily collective - based on the religion of the family, clan, or state - rather than the emerging province of the individual (as popularized by Buddhism and the mystery religions such as Mithraism) and Hellenistic ruler cults from about 300 BCE sometimes promoted the revering of a king as the savior of his people. Prominent examples included Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt and the Seleucids Antiochus I Soter and Demetrius I Soter. In the Egyptian context, the deification of a ruler was built on traditional pharaonic religious ideas.

Pediatric endocrinology,"Pediatric endocrinology (British: Paediatric)  is a medical subspecialty dealing with disorders of the endocrine glands, such as variations of physical growth and sexual development in childhood, diabetes and many more.
By age, pediatric endocrinologists, depending upon the age range of the patients they treat, care for patients from infancy to late adolescence and young adulthood.
The most common disease of the specialty is type 1 diabetes, which usually accounts for at least 50% of a typical clinical practice. The next most common problem is growth disorders, especially those amenable to growth hormone treatment. Pediatric endocrinologists are usually the primary physicians involved in the medical care of infants and children with intersex disorders. The specialty also deals with hypoglycemia and other forms of hyperglycemia in childhood, variations of puberty, as well other adrenal, thyroid, and pituitary problems. Many pediatric endocrinologists have interests and expertise in bone metabolism, lipid metabolism, adolescent gynecology, or inborn errors of metabolism.
Most pediatric endocrinologists in North America and many from around the world can trace their professional genealogy to Lawson Wilkins, who pioneered the specialty in the pediatrics department of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harriet Lane Home in Baltimore in between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s.

In the United States and Canada, pediatric endocrinology is a subspecialty of the American Board of Pediatrics or the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics, with board certification following fellowship training. It is a relatively small and primarily cognitive specialty, with few procedures and an emphasis on diagnostic evaluation.
Training for pediatric endocrinology consists of a 3-year fellowship following completion of a 3-year pediatrics residency. The fellowship, and the specialty, are heavily research-oriented and academically based, although less exclusively now than in past decades.


== Professional organizations ==
The principal North American professional association was originally named the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, now renamed the Pediatric Endocrine Society. Other longstanding pediatric endocrine associations include the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, the Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group and the Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology. Professional associations of the specialty continue to proliferate.


== Controversial treatment guidelines ==
In 2021, the Pediatric Endocrine Society offered updated recommendations for use of growth-promoting hormone therapy and related medications in children. The Guidelines for Growth Hormone and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Treatment in Children and Adolescents were updated from 2003 and reflect the continuing controversy over how to diagnose, categorize and treat growth failure in children. The guideline was developed following the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).
In 2021, the Pediatric Endocrine Society released a position statement in support of Gender Affirming Care (GAC). In it is states, ""Puberty suppression and/or gender-affirming hormone therapy is recommended within this evidence-based approach on a case-by-case basis as medically necessary and is potentially lifesaving."" This position is at odds with the position of England's National Health Service (NHS) which maintains that evidence for puberty blockers and hormone treatment for gender transition wholly is inadequate, and has decided to stop routine prescribing of puberty blockers.

Fire history,"Fire history, the ecological science of studying the history of wildfires, is a subdiscipline of fire ecology. Patterns of forest fires in historical and prehistorical times provide information relevant to the vegetation pattern in modern landscapes. It gives an estimate of a natural disturbance regime's historical range of variability and can be used to identify the processes affecting fire occurrence. Fire history reconstructions are achieved by compiling atlases of past fires, using the tree ring record from fire scars and tree ages and the charcoal record from soils and sediments.


== Prehistoric fires ==
Sustained wildfire can only exist once oxygen levels and fuel sources are present in sufficient quantities. Between 400 and 450 million years ago, fire became a landscape feature.: 11–14  The presence of fusain (fossil charcoal), beginning in the early Carboniferous attests to this fire history and forms an important element of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary.: 11–14 


== Mapped data ==


== Tree-ring data ==

The growth record of a tree in seasonal climates is preserved in the growth rings in the stem wood; the field of dendrochronology is the study of the record of climate and other events preserved in the growth record. Each growth ring represents one year of life. The thickness of each ring indicates the amount of wood produced during that growing season. Large cells can quickly divide rapidly at the beginning of the growing season, creating a light-colored wood. When growth slows down, generally in colder months, a darker wood is created from smaller cells, dividing more slowly. Thus, one year is represented by a light inner ring and a darker outer ring.
Rings can be counted from dead trees and stumps left behind from logging. A sample can be collected from a living tree using tools like the increment borer. The increment borer is a hollow steel tube that extracts a core sample from a tree’s trunk. The growth rings in a core sample are counted to determine the age of that tree. The ages of stand-replacing fires may be determined by determining the cohort age of trees established after a fire. For example, tree-ring dating of large stands will show the age of the forest and may provide an estimate of when the last significant disturbance event occurred.
Sometimes, growth rings exhibit scars. A fire scar forms when heat kills the vascular cambium beneath the bark, which then heals over subsequent years as growth rings curl over the scarred area, thus protecting the tree from infection. This method can be used to date the year a fire occurred. Observing the scars establishes the timeline of a forest fire and the time between fires at a site. Surveying many trees over a large sample area provides a view to individual fire events and the overall fire regime. Not all tree species scar and show evidence of fire. Most pine species in the subgenus Pinus readily produce scars protected by resin; scarring on other trees may result in death, leaving no fire record behind.


=== Research and data examples ===
Before Euro-American settlement in western North America, fire histories from scars preserved in ponderosa pine forests often reveal a pattern of frequent fire (often with 5 to 20-year intervals in a single area), with a pattern in time and space strongly related to past variations in climate. Fuel reduction from grazing and fire suppression significantly reduced the amount of fire in dry forests over the last 100 years.
A study by Arne Buechiling and William L. Baker in 2004 identified 41 fire events beginning in 1533 in a 9200-ha study area north of Estes Park, Colorado. They sampled 3461 tree cores and 212 fire scars. Fire scar data provided greater insight into the fire event parameters. Of the 41 fires, 22 were high-severity crown fires, seven low-severity surface fires, and eight mixed-severity fires. Fires larger than 300 ha were few but composed a substantial proportion of the area burned since 1700. Drought periods produced larger fires.
There is little known about the history of fires in some places. Central Europe, for instance, lacks intact forests with old-growth trees or an abundance of dead or cut-down trees that can be used to reconstruct past fire regimes. The Bialowieza Primeval Forest in Poland is an exception to this condition. A group of researchers were able to use a 350-year tree-ring fire record to reconstruct the fire history in precise detail. This is a shining example of how the method can be used in a place with a lost or no written history of a fire regime.

Control of fire by early humans,"The control of fire by early humans was a critical technology enabling the evolution of humans. Fire provided a source of warmth and lighting, protection from predators (especially at night), a way to create more advanced hunting tools, and a method for cooking food. These cultural advances allowed human geographic dispersal, cultural innovations, and changes to diet and behavior. Additionally, creating fire allowed human activity to continue into the dark and colder hours of the evening.
Claims for the earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range from 1.7 to 2.0 million years ago (Mya). Evidence for the ""microscopic traces of wood ash"" as controlled use of fire by Homo erectus, beginning roughly 1 million years ago, has wide scholarly support. Some of the earliest known traces of controlled fire were found at the Daughters of Jacob Bridge, Israel, and dated to ~790,000 years ago. At the site, archaeologists also found the oldest likely evidence of controlled use of fire to cook food ~780,000 years ago. However, some studies suggest cooking started ~1.8 million years ago.
Flint blades burned in fires roughly 300,000 years ago were found near fossils of early but not entirely modern Homo sapiens in Morocco. Fire was used regularly and systematically by early modern humans to heat treat silcrete stone to increase its flake-ability for the purpose of toolmaking approximately 164,000 years ago at the South African site of Pinnacle Point. Evidence of widespread control of fire by anatomically modern humans dates to approximately 125,000 years ago.


== Control of fire ==

The use and control of fire was a gradual process proceeding through more than one stage. One was a change in habitat, from dense forest, where wildfires were rare but difficult to escape, to savanna (mixed grass/woodland) where wildfires were common but easier to survive. Such a change may have occurred about 3 million years ago, when the savanna expanded in East Africa due to cooler and drier climate.
The next stage involved interaction with burned landscapes and foraging in the wake of wildfires, as observed in various wild animals. In the African savanna, animals that preferentially forage in recently burned areas include savanna chimpanzees (a variety of Pan troglodytes verus), vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and a variety of birds, some of which also hunt insects and small vertebrates in the wake of grass fires.
The next step would be to make some use of residual hot spots that occur in the wake of wildfires. For example, foods found in the wake of wildfires tend to be either burned or undercooked. This might have provided incentives to place undercooked foods on a hotspot or to pull food out of the fire if it was in danger of getting burned. This would require familiarity with fire and its behavior.
An early step in the control of fire would have been transporting it from burned to unburned areas and lighting them on fire, providing advantages in food acquisition. Maintaining a fire over an extended period of time, as for a season (such as the dry season), may have led to the development of base campsites. Building a hearth or other fire enclosure such as a circle of stones would have been a later development. The ability to make fire, generally with a friction device with hardwood rubbing against softwood (as in a bow drill), was a later development.
Each of these stages could occur at different intensities, ranging from occasional or ""opportunistic"" to ""habitual"" to ""obligate"" (unable to survive without it).


== Lower Paleolithic evidence ==

Most of the evidence of controlled use of fire during the Lower Paleolithic is uncertain and has limited scholarly support. Some of the evidence is inconclusive because other plausible explanations, such as natural processes, exist for the findings. Findings support that the earliest known controlled use of fire took place in Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa, 1.0 Mya.


=== Africa ===
Findings from Wonderwerk provide the earliest evidence for controlled use of fire. Intact sediments were analyzed using micromorphological analysis. Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (mFTIR) yielded evidence, in the form of burned bones and ashed plant remains, that burning took place at the site 1.0 Mya.
East African sites, such as Chesowanja near Lake Baringo, Koobi Fora, and Olorgesailie in Kenya, show possible evidence that fire was controlled by early humans. In Chesowanja, archaeologists found red clay clasts dated to 1.4 Mya. These clasts must have been heated to 400 °C (750 °F) to harden. However, tree stumps burned in bush fires in East Africa produce clasts, which, when broken by erosion, are like those described at Chesownja. Controlled use of fire at Chesowanja is unproven.
In Koobi Fora, sites show evidence of control of fire by Homo erectus at 1.5 Mya with findings of reddened sediment that could come from heating at 200–400 °C (400–750 °F). Evidence of possible human control of fire, found at Swartkrans, South Africa, includes burned bones, including ones with hominin-inflicted cut marks, along with Acheulean and bone tools. This site shows some of the earliest evidence of carnivorous behavior in H. erectus. A ""hearth-like depression"" that could have been used to burn bones was found in Olorgesailie, Kenya. However, it did not contain any charcoal, and no signs of fire have been observed. Some microscopic charcoal was found, but it could have resulted from a natural brush fire.
In Gadeb, Ethiopia, fragments of welded tuff that appeared to have been burned were found in Locality 8E but refiring of the rocks might have occurred due to local volcanic activity.
In the Middle Awash River Valley, cone-shaped depressions of reddish clay were found that could have been formed by temperatures of 200 °C (400 °F). These features, thought to have been created by burning tree stumps, were hypothesized to have been produced by early hominids lighting tree stumps so they could have fire away from their habitation site. This view is not widely accepted, though. Burned stones were found in Awash Valley, but volcanic welded tuff is found in the area, which could explain the burned stones.
Burned flints discovered near Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, dated by thermoluminescence to around 300,000 years old, were discovered in the same sedimentary layer as skulls of early Homo sapiens. Paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin believes the flints were used as spear tips and left in fires used by the early humans for cooking food.


=== Asia ===
In Xihoudu in Shanxi Province, China, the black, blue, and grayish-green discoloration of mammalian bones found at the site illustrates evidence of burning by early hominids. In 1985, at a parallel site in China, Yuanmou in Yunnan Province, archaeologists found blackened mammal bones that date back to 1.7 Mya.


==== Middle East ====
A site at Bnot Ya'akov Bridge, Israel, has been claimed to show that H. erectus or H. ergaster controlled fires between 790,000 and 690,000 BP. An AI-powered spectroscopy helped researchers unearth evidence of the use of fire dating 800,000 and 1 million years ago. In an article published in June 2022, researchers from Weizmann Institute of Science, along with researchers at the University of Toronto and Hebrew University of Jerusalem described the use of deep learning models to analyze heat exposure of 26 flint tools that were found in 1970s at the Evron Quarry in the northwest of Israel. The results showed the tools were heated up to 600°C.


==== Southeast Asia ====
At Trinil, Java, burned wood has been found in layers that carried H. erectus (Java Man) fossils dating from 830,000 to 500,000 BP. The burned wood has been claimed to indicate the use of fire by early hominids.


== Middle Paleolithic evidence ==


=== Africa ===
The Cave of Hearths in South Africa has burn deposits, which date from 700,000 to 200,000 BP, as do various other sites such as Montagu Cave (200,000 to 58,000 BP) and the Klasies River Mouth (130,000 to 120,000 BP).
Strong evidence comes from Kalambo Falls in Zambia, where several artifacts related to the use of fire by humans have been recovered, including charred logs, charcoal, carbonized grass stems and plants, and wooden implements, which may have been hardened by fire. The site has been dated through radiocarbon dating to 180,000 BP, through amino-acid racemization.
Fire was used for heat treatment of silcrete stones to increase their workability before they were knapped into tools by Stillbay culture in South Africa. These Stillbay sites date back from 164,000 to 72,000 years ago, with the heat treatment of stone beginning by about 164,000 years ago.


=== Asia ===

Evidence at Zhoukoudian cave in China suggests control of fire as early as 460,000 to 230,000 BP. Fire in Zhoukoudian is suggested by the presence of burned bones, burned chipped-stone artifacts, charcoal, ash, and hearths alongside H. erectus fossils in Layer 10, the earliest archaeological horizon at the site. This evidence comes from Locality 1, also known as the Peking Man site, where several bones were found to be uniformly black to grey. The bone extracts were determined to be characteristic of burned bone rather than manganese staining. These residues also showed IR spectra for oxides, and a turquoise bone was reproduced in the laboratory by heating some of the other bones found in Layer 10. The same effect might have been at the site due to natural heating, as the effect was produced on white, yellow, and black bones.
Layer 10 is ash with biologically produced silicon, aluminum, iron, and potassium, but wood ash remnants such as siliceous aggregates are missing. Among these are possible hearths ""represented by finely laminated silt and clay interbedded with reddish-brown and yellow-brown fragments of organic matter, locally mixed with limestone fragments and dark brown finely laminated silt, clay, and organic matter."" The site itself does not show that fires were made in Zhoukoudian, but the association of blackened bones with quartzite artifacts at least shows that humans did control fire at the time of the habitation of the Zhoukoudian cave.


==== Middle East ====
At the Amudian site of Qesem Cave, near the city of Kfar Qasim, Israel, evidence exists of the regular use of fire from before 382,000 BP to around 200,000 BP, at the end of Lower Pleistocene. Large quantities of burned bone and moderately heated soil lumps were found, and the cut marks found on the bones suggest that butchering and prey-defleshing took place near fireplaces. In addition, hominins living in Qesem cave managed to heat their flint to varying temperatures before knapping it into different tools.


==== Indian Subcontinent ====
The earliest evidence for controlled fire use by humans on the Indian subcontinent, dating to between 50,000 and 55,000 years ago, comes from the Main Belan archaeological site, located in the Belan River valley in Uttar Pradesh, India.


=== Europe ===
Multiple sites in Europe, such as Torralba and Ambrona, Spain, and St. Esteve-Janson, France, have also shown evidence of the use of fire by later versions of H. erectus. The oldest has been found in England at the site of Beeches Pit, Suffolk; uranium series dating and thermoluminescence dating place the use of fire at 415,000 BP. At Vértesszőlős, Hungary, while no charcoal has been found, burned bones have been discovered dating from c. 350,000 years ago. At Torralba and Ambrona, Spain, objects such as Acheulean stone tools, remains of large mammals such as extinct elephants, charcoal, and wood were discovered. At Terra Amata in France, there is a fireplace with ashes (dated between 380,000 BP and 230,000 BP). At Saint-Estève-Janson in France, there is evidence of five hearths and reddened earth in the Escale Cave; these hearths have been dated to 200,000 BP. Evidence for fire making dates to at least the Middle Paleolithic, with dozens of Neanderthal hand axes from France exhibiting use-wear traces suggesting these tools were struck with the mineral pyrite to produce sparks around 50,000 years ago.


== Impact on human evolution ==


=== Cultural innovation ===


==== Uses of fire by early humans ====
The discovery of fire came to provide a wide variety of uses for early hominids. Its warmth kept them alive during low nighttime temperatures in colder environments, allowing geographic expansion from tropical and subtropical climates to temperate areas. Its blaze warded off predatory animals, especially in the dark.
Fire also played a major role in changing food habits. Cooking allowed a significant increase in meat consumption and calorie intake. It was soon discovered that meat could also be dried and smoked by fire, preserving it for lean seasons. Fire was even used in manufacturing tools for hunting and butchering. Hominids also learned that starting bush fires to burn large areas could increase land fertility and clear terrain to make hunting easier. Evidence shows that early hominids were able to corral and trap prey animals by means of fire. Fire was used to clear out caves prior to living in them, helping to begin the use of shelter. The many uses of fire may have led to specialized social roles, such as the separation of cooking from hunting.
The control of fire enabled important changes in human behavior, health, energy expenditure, and geographic expansion. Hominids could move into much colder regions that would have previously been uninhabitable after the loss of body hair. Evidence of more complex management to change biomes can be found as far back as 200,000 to 100,000 years ago at a minimum.


==== Tool and weapon making ====
Fire allowed major innovations in tool and weapon manufacture. Evidence dating to roughly 164,000 years ago indicates that early humans in South Africa during the Middle Stone Age used fire to alter the mechanical properties of tool materials applying heat treatment to a fine-grained rock called silcrete. The heated rocks were then tempered into crescent-shaped blades or arrowheads for hunting and butchering prey. This may have been the first time that bow and arrow were used for hunting, with far-ranging impact.


==== Art and ceramics ====
Fire was used in the creation of art. Archaeologists have discovered several 1- to 10-inch Venus figurine statues in Europe dating to the Paleolithic, several carved from stone and ivory, others shaped from clay and then fired. These are some of the earliest examples of ceramics. Fire was also commonly used to create pottery. Although pottery was formerly thought to have begun with the Neolithic around 10,000 years ago, scientists in China discovered pottery fragments in the Xianrendong Cave that were about 20,000 years old. During the Neolithic Age and agricultural revolution about 10,000 years ago, pottery became far more common and widespread, often carved and painted with simple linear designs and geometric shapes.


==== Social development and nighttime activity ====
Fire was an important factor in expanding and developing societies of early hominids. One impact fire might have had was social stratification. The power to make and wield fire may have conferred prestige and social position. Fire also led to a lengthening of daytime activities, and allowed more nighttime activities. Evidence of large hearths indicate that the majority of nighttime was spent around the fire. The increased social interaction from gathering around the fire may have fostered the development of language.
Another effect of fire use on hominid societies was that it required larger groups to work together to maintain the fire, finding fuel, portioning it onto the fire, and re-igniting it when necessary. These larger groups might have included older individuals such as grandparents, who helped to care for children. Ultimately, fire had a significant influence on the size and social interactions of early hominid communities.
Exposure to artificial light during later hours of the day changed humans' circadian rhythms, contributing to a longer waking day. The modern human's waking day is 16 hours, while many mammals are only awake for half as many hours. Additionally, humans are most awake during the early evening hours, while other primates' days begin at dawn and end at sundown. Many of these behavioral changes can be attributed to the control of fire and its impact on daylight extension.


=== The cooking hypothesis ===
The cooking hypothesis proposes the idea that the ability to cook allowed for the brain size of hominids to increase over time. This idea was first presented by Friedrich Engels in the article ""The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man"" and later recapitulated in the book Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human by Richard Wrangham and then in a book by Suzana Herculano-Houzel. Critics of the hypothesis argue that cooking with controlled fire was insufficient to start the increasing brain size trend.
The cooking hypothesis gains support by comparing the nutrients in raw food to the much more easily digested nutrients in cooked food, as in an examination of protein ingestion from raw vs. cooked egg. Scientists have found that among several primates, the restriction of feeding to raw foods during daylight hours limits the metabolic energy available. Genus Homo was able to break through the limit by cooking food to shorten their feeding times and be able to absorb more nutrients to accommodate the increasing need for energy. In addition, scientists argue that the Homo species was also able to obtain nutrients like docosahexaenoic acid from algae that were especially beneficial and critical for brain evolution, and the detoxification of food by the cooking process enabled early humans to access these resources.
Besides the brain, other human organs also demand a high metabolism. During human evolution, the body-mass proportion of different organs changed to allow brain expansion. 


==== Changes to diet ====
Before the advent of fire, the hominid diet was limited to mostly plant parts composed of simple sugars and carbohydrates such as seeds, flowers, and fleshy fruits. Parts of the plant such as stems, mature leaves, enlarged roots, and tubers would have been inaccessible as a food source due to the indigestibility of raw cellulose and starch. Cooking, however, made starchy and fibrous foods edible and greatly increased the diversity of other foods available to early humans. Toxin-containing foods including seeds and similar carbohydrate sources, such as cyanogenic glycosides found in linseed and cassava, were incorporated into their diets as cooking rendered them nontoxic.
Cooking could also kill parasites, reduce the amount of energy required for chewing and digestion, and release more nutrients from plants and meat. Due to the difficulty of chewing raw meat and digesting tough proteins (e.g. collagen) and carbohydrates, the development of cooking served as an effective mechanism to efficiently process meat and allow for its consumption in larger quantities. With its high caloric density and content of important nutrients, meat thus became a staple in the diet of early humans. By increasing digestibility, cooking allowed hominids to maximize the energy gained from consuming foods. Studies show that caloric intake from cooking starches improves 12-35% and 45-78% for protein. As a result of the increases in net energy gain from food consumption, survival and reproductive rates in hominids increased. Through lowering food toxicity and increasing nutritive yield, cooking allowed for an earlier weaning age, permitting females to have more children. In this way, too, it facilitated population growth.
It has been proposed that the use of fire for cooking caused environmental toxins to accumulate in the placenta, which led to a species-wide taboo on human placentophagy around the time of the mastery of fire. Placentophagy is common in other primates.


==== Biological changes ====
Before their use of fire, the hominid species had large premolars, which were used to chew harder foods, such as large seeds. In addition, due to the shape of the molar cusps, the diet is inferred to have been more leaf- or fruit-based. Probably in response to consuming cooked foods, the molar teeth of H. erectus gradually shrank, suggesting that their diet had changed from tougher foods such as crisp root vegetables to softer cooked foods such as meat. Cooked foods further selected for the differentiation of their teeth and eventually led to a decreased jaw volume with a variety of smaller teeth in hominids. Today, a smaller jaw volume and teeth size of humans is seen in comparison to other primates.
Due to the increased digestibility of many cooked foods, less digestion was needed to procure the necessary nutrients. As a result, the gastrointestinal tract and organs in the digestive system decreased in size. This is in contrast to other primates, where a larger digestive tract is needed for fermentation of long carbohydrate chains. Thus, humans evolved from the large colons and tracts that are seen in other primates to smaller ones.
According to Wrangham, control of fire allowed hominids to sleep on the ground and in caves instead of trees and led to more time being spent on the ground. This may have contributed to the evolution of bipedalism, as such an ability became increasingly necessary for human activity.


==== Criticism ====
Critics of the hypothesis argue that while a linear increase in brain volume of the genus Homo is seen over time, adding fire control and cooking does not add anything meaningful to the data. Species such as H. ergaster existed with large brain volumes during time periods with little to no evidence of fire for cooking. Little variation exists in the brain sizes of H. erectus dated from periods of weak and strong evidence for cooking. An experiment involving mice fed raw versus cooked meat found that cooking meat did not increase the amount of calories taken up by mice, leading to the study's conclusion that the energetic gain is the same, if not greater, in raw meat diets than cooked meats. Studies such as this and others have led to criticisms of the hypothesis that state that the increases in human brain-size occurred well before the advent of cooking due to a shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to the consumption of meat. Other anthropologists argue that the evidence suggests that cooking fires began in earnest only 250,000 BP, when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burned animal bones, and flint appear across Europe and the Middle East.

Runnymede,"Runnmede is a water-meadow in Surrey, England, 20 miles (32 km) west of London. The site is owned and managed by The National Trust, and runs alongside the River Thames. It is one of England's most visited tourist sites.
At Runnymede, King John sealed Magna Carta in 1215. Over eight centuries later, the memorial for those of the Allied Air Forces who died in World War II was placed on Runnymede. The British memorial to John F. Kennedy was put there in 1965.


== History ==
The name Runnymede may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon 'runieg' (regular meeting) and 'mede' (mead or meadow), describing a place in the meadows used to hold regular meetings. The Witan, the Saxon Council, was held from time to time at Runnymede during the reign of Alfred the Great. The Council met usually in the open air, a tradition that influenced the creation of the English Parliament in the 13th century.


== Kennedy Memorial ==
Visitors reach the memorial by treading a steep path of irregular granite steps, intended to symbolise a pilgrimage. There are 50 steps in total. Each step is different to all others, with the entire flight made from 60,000 hand-cut granite blocks.
The landscape architect Geoffrey Jellicoe designed the garden; the sculptor Alan Collins designed and carved the stone inscription.
The round on which the memorial is situated was given as a gift to the United States by the British people. It is maintained by the Kennedy Memorial Trust, which also sponsors educational scholarships for British students to attend university in the United States.
In 1968, the 7-ton stone was damaged by a bomb during a time of demonstrations against the Vietnam War; it was later repaired by the sculptor.

Monumental sculpture,"The term monumental sculpture is often used in art history and criticism, but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It is often used for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians, although in contemporary art a rather larger overall scale is implied.  Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable figurines, small metal or ivory reliefs, diptychs and the like.
The term is also used to describe sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a monument of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, tomb monuments or memorials, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just funerary sculpture for church monuments.
The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are.  The entry for ""Monumental"" in A Dictionary of Art and Artists by Peter and Linda Murray describes it as:

The most overworked word in current art history and criticism.  It is intended to convey the idea that a particular work of art, or part of such a work, is grand, noble, elevated in idea, simple in conception and execution, without any excess of virtuousity, and having something of the enduring, stable, and timeless nature of great architecture. ... It is not a synonym for 'large'.
However, this does not constitute an accurate or adequate description of the use of the term for sculpture, though many uses of the term that essentially mean either large or ""used in a memorial"" may involve this concept also, in ways that are hard to separate.  For example, when Meyer Schapiro, after a chapter analysing the carved capitals at Moissac, says: ""in the tympanum of the south portal [(right)] the sculpture of Moissac becomes truly monumental.  It is placed above the level of the eye, and is so large as to dominate the entire entrance.  It is a gigantic semi-circular relief ..."", size is certainly the dominant part of what he means by the word, and Schapiro's further comments suggest that a lack of ""excess of virtuousity"" does not form part of what he intends to convey.  Nonetheless, parts of the Murray's concept (""grand, noble, elevated in idea"") are included in his meaning, although ""simple in conception and execution"" hardly seems to apply.


== Meaning in different contexts ==
It is only in wealthy societies that the possibility of creating sculptures that are large but merely decorative really exists (at least in long-lived materials such as stone), so for most of art history the different senses of the term cause no difficulties.  The term may be used differently for different periods, with breaks occurring around the Renaissance and the early 20th century: for ancient and medieval sculpture size is normally the criterion, though smaller architectural sculptures are usually covered by the term, but in the Early Modern period a specific funerary function may be meant, before the typical meaning once again comes to refer to size alone for contemporary sculpture. The relevant chapters in Parts 2-4 of The Oxford History of Western Art are titled as follows: ""Monumental Sculpture to c.1300"", ""Monumental Sculpture 1300–1600"", ""Free-standing Sculpture c.1600–c.1700"", ""Forms in Space c.1700–1770"", ""Sculptures and Publics"" (1770–1914).


== In art history ==


=== Appearance of monumental sculpture in a culture ===
In archeology and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains; the totem pole is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology.  The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization.

In Ancient Egypt, the Great Sphinx of Giza probably dates to the 3rd millennium BC, and may be older than the Pyramids of Egypt.  The discovery in 1986 of an ancient Chinese Bronze Age 8.5 foot tall bronze statue at Sanxingdui disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.  Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the Indus Valley civilization, appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals.  The Mississippian culture seems to have progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed.  Other cultures, such as Ancient Egypt and the Easter Island culture, seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage.


=== Disappearance of monumental sculpture ===
When a culture ceases to produce monumental sculpture, there may be a number of reasons. The most common is societal collapse, as in Europe during the so-called Dark Ages or the Classic Maya collapse in Mesoamerica.  Another may be aniconism, usually religiously motivated, as followed the Muslim conquests.  Both the rise of Christianity (initially) and later the Protestant Reformation brought a halt to religious monumental sculpture in the regions concerned, and greatly reduced production of any monumental sculpture for several centuries. Byzantine art, which had largely avoided the societal collapse in the Western Roman Empire, never resumed the use of monumental figurative sculpture, whether in religious or secular contexts, and was to ban even two-dimensional religious art for a period in the Byzantine iconoclasm.


== Contemporary work ==
""Monumental sculpture"" is still used within the stoneworking and funeral trades to cover all forms of grave headstones and other funerary art, regardless of size.  In contemporary art, however, the term is used to refer to all large sculptures regardless of purpose, and also carries a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture.  Sculptures covered by the term in modern art are likely to be over two metres in at least one dimension, and sufficiently large not to need a high plinth, though they may have one.  Many are still commissioned as public art, often for placing at outdoor sites.

Cryptid town,"A cryptid town is a colloquial term given to a town which has a close cultural identity with a local cryptid, often with the goal of encouraging cryptid-related tourism. Cryptid towns may have festivals, museums, statues and research organisations dedicated to a given cryptid. Areas called cryptid towns tend to be rural and remote, which correlates with the types of areas cryptids are said to often originate from, which in turn can make them appear economically deprived and reliant on the economy of cryptid tourism. Some places may not necessarily be best known for their folklore or rely on it for tourism, but do still feature it prominently in events and local culture.


== Notable examples ==


=== Point Pleasant, West Virginia ===
Point Pleasant, West Virginia, with a population of around 4,000, has a festival, museum and statue dedicated to its local cryptid, the Mothman.


==== Annual Mothman Festival ====

The Annual Mothman Festival was founded by Jeff Wamsley and Carolin Harris in 2002 as an attempt to drive tourism to the area and is celebrated in the month of September. The festival has been credited with creating an ""economic boom"" for the local community each year and features merchandise vendors, guest speakers, food, live music and exhibitions. Cosplay is practiced by many attendees and is encouraged by the festival. In 2022, organisers claimed the festival brought in over $2 million in revenue and regularly attracts between 12,000 and 15,000 attendees.


=== Sutton and Flatwoods, West Virginia ===
Sutton, West Virginia, with a population of around 859, has a museum dedicated to the Flatwoods monster, featuring life-size replicas of the creature, various interpretations of it in the form of drawings, figurines and artwork, as well as merchandise. A Flatwoods Monster Convention was held in 2023, which drew visitors in from around the country. Locals say that, across Braxton County, people can sometimes be found staking out at campgrounds to try and spot the creature, and children have been known to dress up as the Flatwoods monster for Halloween. Sutton is unique as a cryptid town, as the Flatwoods monster did not originate there, but rather from the nearby town of Flatwoods, West Virginia.
Flatwoods, which comparatively has a much smaller population of around 264, instead features a simple welcome sign that read ""Welcome to Flatwoods, Home of the Green Monster"". Also in the town is a Flatwoods monster and alien themed restaurant and dairy bar, the Spot, and one of five decorative chairs that depict the cryptid, which are spread around Braxton County.


=== Drumnadrochit, Scotland ===
Drumnadrochit, Scotland, with a population of around 1,130, is home to the Loch Ness Centre and Nessieland, which entertain the idea of the Loch Ness Monster. The Loch Ness Centre focuses on the history of the Loch and the monster associated with it, offering an ""immersive experience"" and showcasing eyewitness accounts, photographs, videos and artifacts. Nessieland, named so after the affectionate term for the cryptid, Nessie, is a family attraction that features a souvenir shop, children's playground and view of the Loch. The village attracts many tourists and so-called ""monster hunters"".
Drumnadrochit received significant attention in 2023 when the Loch Ness Centre conducted a large-scale search for the monster, with around 300 volunteers assisting in the search.
