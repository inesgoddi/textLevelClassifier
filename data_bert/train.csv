Tourism,"Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel.     UN Tourism defines tourism more generally, in terms which go ""beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only"", as people ""travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes"". Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.
Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, but slowly recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might have decreased by 58% to 78% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in international tourism receipts.
Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012. Emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.
Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies. For this reason, many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism to mitigate the negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism. The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, through programs like the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017, and programs like Tourism for SDGs focusing on how SDG 8, SDG 12 and SDG 14 implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy.
Tourism has reached new dimensions with the emerging industry of space tourism, as well as the cruise ship industry.


== Etymology ==
The English-language word tourist was used in 1772 and tourism in 1811. These words derive from the word tour, which comes from Old English turian, from Old French torner, from Latin tornare - ""to turn on a lathe"", which is itself from Ancient Greek tornos (τόρνος) - ""lathe"".


== Definitions ==
In 1936, the League of Nations defined a foreign tourist as ""someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours"". Its successor, the United Nations, amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.
In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as ""the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity."" In 1976, the Tourism Society of England's definition was: ""Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes."" In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.
In 1994, the United Nations identified three forms of tourism in its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics:

Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country
Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country
Other groupings derived from the above grouping:

National tourism, a combination of domestic and outbound tourism
Regional tourism, a combination of domestic and inbound tourism
International tourism, a combination of inbound and outbound tourism
The terms tourism and travel are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms tourism and tourist are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, traveller is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.

There are many varieties of tourism. Of those types, there are multiple forms of outdoor-oriented tourism. Outdoor tourism is generally categorized into nature, eco, and adventure tourism (NEAT). These categories share many similarities but also have specific unique characteristics. Nature tourism generally encompasses tourism activities that would take place outside. Nature tourism appeals to a large audience of tourists and many may not know they are participating in this form of tourism. This type of tourism has a low barrier to entry and is accessible to a large population. Ecotourism focuses on education, maintaining a social responsibility for the community and the environment, as well as centering economic growth around the local economy. Weaver describes ecotourism as sustainable nature-based tourism. Ecotourism is more specific than nature tourism and works toward accomplishing a specific goal through the outdoors. Finally, we have adventure tourism. Adventure tourism is the most extreme of the categories and includes participation in activities and sports that require a level of skill or experience, risk, and physical exertion. Adventure tourism often appeals less to the general public than nature and ecotourism and tends to draw in individuals who partake in such activities with limited marketing.
It is important to understand that these definitions may vary. Perceived risk in adventure tourism is subjective and may change for each individual.
Examples of these tourism types.
Nature tourism

Hiking, walking, camping
Ecotourism

Guided tours focusing on educating, summer camps, outdoor classes
Adventure tourism

White water rafting, ice climbing, mountaineering


=== Tourism products ===
According to the World Tourism Organization, a tourism product is:

""a combination of tangible and intangible elements, such as natural, cultural, and man-made resources, attractions, facilities, services and activities around a specific center of interest which represents the core of the destination marketing mix and creates an overall visitor experience including emotional aspects for the potential customers. A tourism product is priced and sold through distribution channels and it has a life-cycle"".
Tourism product covers a wide variety of services including:

Accommodation services from low-cost homestays to five-star hotels
Hospitality services including food and beverage serving centers
Health care services like massage
All modes of transport, its booking and rental
Travel agencies, guided tours and tourist guides
Cultural services such as religious monuments, museums, and historical places
Shopping


=== International tourism ===

International tourism is tourism that crosses national borders. Globalisation has made tourism a popular global leisure activity. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people ""traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes"". The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 500,000 people are in flight at any one time.
In 2010, international tourism reached US$919B, growing 6.5% over 2009, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.7%. In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide. By 2016 that number had risen to 1,235 million, producing 1,220  billion USD in destination spending. The COVID-19 crisis had significant negative effects on international tourism significantly slowing the overall increasing trend.
International tourism has significant impacts on the environment, exacerbated in part by the problems created by air travel but also by other issues, including wealthy tourists bringing lifestyles that stress local infrastructure, water and trash systems among others.


== Basis ==
Tourism typically requires the tourist to feel engaged in a genuine experience of the location they are visiting. According to Dean MacCannell, tourism requires that the tourist can view the toured area as both authentic and different from their own lived experience.: 113  By viewing the ""exotic,"" tourists learn what they themselves are not: that is, they are ""un-exotic,"" or normal.
According to MacCannell, all modern tourism experiences the ""authentic"" and ""exotic"" as ""developmentally inferior"" to the modern—that is, to the lived experience of the tourist.: 114 


== History ==


=== Ancient ===
Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times travelled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, learn new languages, experience new cultures, enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines. As early as Shulgi, however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travellers. Travelling for pleasure can be seen in Egypt as early on as 1500 BC. Ancient Roman tourists during the Republic would visit spas and coastal resorts such as Baiae. They were popular among the rich. The Roman upper class used to spend their free time on land or at sea and travelled to their villa urbana or villa maritima. Numerous villas were located in Campania, around Rome and in the northern part of the Adriatic as in Barcola near Trieste. Pausanias wrote his Description of Greece in the second century AD. In ancient China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and, on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.


=== Medieval ===
By the post-classical era, many religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam had developed traditions of pilgrimage. The Canterbury Tales (c. 1390s), which uses a pilgrimage as a framing device, remains a classic of English literature, and Journey to the West (c. 1592), which holds a seminal place in Chinese literature, has a Buddhist pilgrimage at the center of its narrative.
In medieval Italy, Petrarch wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of Mont Ventoux that praised the act of travelling and criticized frigida incuriositas (a 'cold lack of curiosity'); this account is regarded as one of the first known instances of travel being undertaken for its own sake. The Burgundian poet Michault Taillevent later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the Jura Mountains.
In China, 'travel record literature' (遊記文學; yóujì wénxué) became popular during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). Travel writers such as Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' Record of Stone Bell Mountain by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.


=== Grand Tour ===

Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the Grand Tour, which was a traditional trip around Europe (especially Germany and Italy), undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, the young Prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa, the eldest son of Sigismund III, embarked on a journey across Europe, as was in custom among Polish nobility. He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, where he admired the siege of Breda by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic. It was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of Italian opera in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s and generally followed a standard itinerary. It was an educational opportunity and rite of passage. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent, and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and Thomas Cook made the ""Cook's Tour"" a byword.
The Grand Tour became a status symbol for upper-class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers, and travellers (such as Goethe) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France, and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centers, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.
The New York Times recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-Oxbridge trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of Western civilization. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they commissioned paintings, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.
The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.


=== Emergence of leisure travel ===

Leisure travel was associated with the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom – the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new middle class. Cox & Kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.
The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In Nice, France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the French Riviera, the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the Promenade des Anglais; in many other historic resorts in continental Europe, old, well-established palace hotels have names like the Hotel Bristol, Hotel Carlton, or Hotel Majestic – reflecting the dominance of English customers.
A pioneer of the travel agency business, Thomas Cook's idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at Kibworth. With the opening of the extended Midland Counties Railway, he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from Leicester Campbell Street station to a rally in Loughborough, eleven miles (18 km) away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. This was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains. During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and Sunday school children. In 1844, the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.
In 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to Calais to coincide with the Paris Exhibition. The following year he started his ""grand circular tours"" of Europe. During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt, and the United States. Cook established ""inclusive independent travel"", whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food, and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.


== Economic significance of tourism ==

The tourism industry, as part of the service sector, has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries. The Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as ""an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations.""
Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists, accounting as of 2011 for 30% of the world's trade in services, and, as an invisible export, for 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism. It is also claimed that travel broadens the mind.
The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services (such as airlines, cruise ships, transits, trains and taxicabs); lodging (including hotels, hostels, homestays, resorts and renting out rooms); and entertainment venues (such as amusement parks, restaurants, casinos, festivals, shopping malls, music venues, and theatres). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including souvenirs.
On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest. Tourism frequently also puts additional pressure on the local environment.
The economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets, the cultural property and the nature of the travel location. The World Heritage Sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets. But even a country's current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism. For example, the fascination of the British royal family brings millions of tourists to Great Britain every year and thus the economy around £550 million a year. The Habsburg family can be mentioned in Central Europe. According to estimates, the Habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of 60 million euros per year for Vienna alone. The tourist principle ""Habsburg sells"" applies.


== Tourism, cultural heritage and UNESCO ==

Cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism. Cultural tourism is one of the megatrends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales. As UNESCO is increasingly observing, the cultural heritage is needed for tourism, but also endangered by it. The ""ICOMOS - International Cultural Tourism Charter"" from 1999 is already dealing with all of these problems. As a result of the tourist hazard, for example, the Lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists. Overtourism is an important buzzword in this area. Furthermore, the focus of UNESCO in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population. And there is intensive cooperation between UNESCO, the United Nations, the United Nations peacekeeping and Blue Shield International. There are extensive international and national considerations, studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war. In particular, it is also about training civilian and military personnel. But the involvement of the locals is particularly important. The founding president of Blue Shield International Karl von Habsburg summed it up with the words: ""Without the local community and without the local participants, that would be completely impossible'.


== Cruise ships ==

Cruising is a popular form of water tourism. Leisure cruise ships were introduced by the P&O in 1844, sailing from Southampton to destinations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Athens. In 1891, German businessman Albert Ballin sailed the ship Augusta Victoria from Hamburg into the Mediterranean Sea. 29 June 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was Prinzessin Victoria Luise, built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.


== Modern day tourism ==


=== Mass tourism ===

Mass tourism and its tourist attractions have emerged as among the most iconic demonstration of western consumer societies. Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals. This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and was pioneered by Thomas Cook. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses, in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used Thomas Cook & Son.
The relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads. One contemporary form of mass tourism, package tourism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.
Travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.
Improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.
In Continental Europe, early seaside resorts included: Heiligendamm, founded in 1793 at the Baltic Sea, being the first seaside resort; Ostend, popularised by the people of Brussels; Boulogne-sur-Mer and Deauville for the Parisians; Taormina in Sicily. In the United States, the first seaside resorts in the European style were at Atlantic City, New Jersey and Long Island, New York.
By the mid-20th century, the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the Spanish economic ""miracle"".
In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists discussed negative socio-cultural impacts of tourism on host communities. Since the 1980s the positive aspects of tourism began to be recognized as well.
In more recent times, mass tourism is something which has become a negative experience for local residents of cities and destinations that experience heavy tourism, especially in summer months. In July 2024 for example, protests by local residents in Barcelona, Spain were held in the city, where ″thousands of people joined an anti-tourism protest amid rising housing costs.″


=== Niche tourism ===

Niche tourism refers to the specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics. Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:

Other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term ""destination"" in the descriptions, such as destination weddings, and terms such as location vacation.


=== Winter tourism ===

St. Moritz, Switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend. It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.
Major ski resorts are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey), Canada, the United States (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) Argentina, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Chile, and Lebanon.


== Recent developments ==
There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades, especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialized holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted destination hotels.
The developments in air transport infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable. A major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels. The WHO estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time. There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example, some retirement-age people sustain year-round tourism. This is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.
There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations, such as in Bali and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a tsunami, caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, hit the Asian countries on the Indian Ocean, including the Maldives. Thousands of people died including many tourists. This, together with the vast clean-up operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.
Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like CouchSurfing and airbnb being established. There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in Dubai.


=== Sustainable tourism ===


=== Ecotourism ===

Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveller; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities, and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights. Take only memories and leave only footprints is a very common slogan in protected areas. Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.


=== Volunteer tourism ===

Volunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying ""to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society"". VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.
This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism. However, increasingly, voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives, while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist. Increasingly, organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.


=== Pro-poor tourism ===

Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the Overseas Development Institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in Tanzania and cultural tourism in Luang Prabang, Laos. There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.


=== Recession tourism ===

Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place at once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation.


=== Medical tourism ===

When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Eastern Europe, Cuba and Canada where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. dentistry), travelling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as ""medical tourism"".


=== Educational tourism ===

Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment. Brent W. Ritchie, publisher of Managing Educational Tourism, created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last 15 years. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program. In 2018, one impact was many exchange students traveled to America to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education.


=== Event tourism ===

This type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the city/region. This type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival South by",1
Theology of religions,"The theology of religions is the branch of theology (mostly represented by Christian, Hindu, Islamic and Jewish theology) and religious studies that attempts to theologically evaluate the phenomena of religions. Three important schools within Christian theology of religions are pluralism, inclusivism, and exclusivism, which describe the relation of other religious traditions to Christianity and attempt to answer questions about the nature of God and salvation.


== Purpose of the Theology of Religions ==
The American theologian Langdon Brown Gilkey argued that the political situation of the West following World War II left a need for Christian thinkers to reconsider the place of other religions specifically because of the changing political world:

Colonies vanished, Europe disappeared as a major power, other non-western power centers appeared representing other ways of life and other religions. The West no longer ruled the world... Western religion became one among the other world religions.


== Basic Three-Point Model ==
The most common model of the views that Christians take of other religions is a simple three-point model first articulated by Alan Race.


=== Pluralism ===
Pluralism is the belief that multiple religions are true and equally valid in their communication of the truth about God, the world, and salvation. The chief expounder of this view is John Hick of Claremont Graduate School in California, who first propounded it in his book God and the Universe of Faiths (1973).


==== Criticism ====
John Hick's argument has been notably criticized in the declaration Dominus Iesus by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.
To a pluralist such as Hick, Christianity is not the absolute, unique, and final way to God, but one among several. While pluralists assert the validity of all religions, they also deny the finality of all religions. Hick challenges the older view that Christ or Christianity must be seen at the center of religions and argues instead that God must be seen at the center of religions, a view also called theo-centrism. The pluralistic contention is that although religions have different outward forms, all have the same source in the same god.
To an evangelical Christian, such pluralism only means the abolition of kerygmatic mission (i.e., the mission of evangelizing the world with the salvific gospel of Jesus Christ).  Pluralism has been criticized as an invasive force that masquerades as Christianity while imperialistically demanding the surrender of Christian distinctiveness.  Pluralists respond that Christian pluralism is not an invasive force at all, but actually arises from tensions within the Christian tradition, through a process of auto-deconstruction. Some have pointed out similarities between Hick's theo-centrism and Hindu pluralism as propounded in the Bhagavad Gita:

By whatsoever way men worship Me, even so do I accept them; for, in all ways, O Partha, men walk in My path"" (IV.11) 
Another common evangelical criticism of pluralism is that the religions of the world are fundamentally and irreconcilably different, and that to value them equally requires a devaluation of propositional truth claims.  It is for this reason that pluralism is often treated as a form of self-defeating relativism, though pluralists generally do not accept this label.  According to John Hick, ""Religious pluralism is emphatically not a form of relativism.""  Hick considers himself a critical realist.


=== Inclusivism ===
Inclusivism is the belief that God is present in non-Christian religions to save adherents through Christ. The inclusivist view has given rise to the concept of the ""anonymous Christian"", an adherent of a non-Christian religion whom the Christian God nevertheless saves through Christ. This position was popularized by the Roman Catholic theologian, Karl Rahner (b. 1904-d.1984).
Christian inclusivism is based on two axioms: the first is that salvation is through Christ alone, the second is that God wills the whole world to be saved. Consequently, argue inclusivists, God saves people through Christ alone; however, he makes this possible through ways that extend to all humanity.
To Rahner, a non-Christian religion is a lawful religion for until its followers have a Christian witness it is a means by which non-Christians gain a right relationship with God. Also, the religion is included in God’s plan of salvation which God has ordained for the communication of His grace.
Inclusivism has a great appeal to people because of its sympathetic approach to religion.


=== Exclusivism ===

Exclusivism is the theological position that holds that there is no salvation in non-Christian religions. Notable among the exclusivists of the twentieth century are Samuel Zwemer, Hendrik Kraemer, and Lesslie Newbigin.
Citing the Aristotelian concept of truth as one and not many, exclusivists regard all religious claims other than Christianity as false and invalid. Exclusivists hold that salvation is through Christ alone, and that non-Christians cannot be saved because they neither recognize Christ's uniqueness nor lordship.
Extremist exclusivism perceives all non-Christian religions as demonic and enemies of Christian truth. Moderate exclusivism sees some non-Christian religions as containing elements whereby a dialogue with them can be initiated.
Exclusivists argue that all claims to truth, including those made by pluralists and inclusivists, must exclude alternative claims.  However, some exclusivists acknowledge that the Bible also speaks of the Christian God as involved in the history of the nations. Thus, though being very vociferous in his attacks on Hinduism, Nehemiah Goreh could say that ‘Most erroneous as is the teaching of such books as the Bhagvadgita,  the Bhagvata, etc., yet they teach something of ananyabhakti (undivided devotedness to God), of vairagya (giving up the world), of namrata (humility), of ksama (forbearance), etc., which enables one to appreciate the precepts of Christianity.’
Hendrik Kraemer's exclusivism is based on a skepticism towards claims of similarity between religions: ""Every religion is an individisble, and not to be divided"". Religion ""is not a series of tenets, institutions, practices that can be taken one by one as independent items of religious life"".


== Knitter's Four-Point Model ==
A significant expansion of the three-point model was proposed by Paul F. Knitter in his 2002 book Introducing Theologies of Religions. He outlined four possible views or models that one could adopt.


=== The Replacement Model ===
Knitter's ""replacement model"" corresponds to Exclusivism in the three-point model, but is split into two subsections: Total Replacement and Partial Replacement. The Total Replacement model is most frequently found in Fundamentalist/Evangelical churches, and largely represents the work of Karl Barth. It suggests that the reason the Christian religion is considered true is that it realizes that all religion is false (including itself), and recognizes that the only true belief can be found in Jesus. It does not necessarily say that there is nothing of value in other religions, but simply that there is no use in studying other religions, as everything of value can be found in Christ. The Partial Replacement model has similar things to say about other religions, but does not go so far as to say that there is nothing of value in other religions. It suggests that other religions might have access to God's revelation, but not to God's salvation. This is an important distinction, as it implies that some truth can be found in other religions, but not whole of the truth, and not enough to receive salvation. This view is largely based on the views expressed by the World Council of Churches in their discussion on religious dialogue and theology.


=== The Fulfillment Model ===
Knitter's main contribution, informed by his Christian faith and the idea that Christianity is a fulfillment of Judaism, implies that, while the previous religion was not wrong, it was incomplete and awaiting later fulfillment. This view is also held by some forms of Islam with respect to Christianity and Judaism before them, as well as by Mormonism and all other faiths who feel they have a later clarification from God.
However, one's religion does not have to be founded after others in order to see one's religion as a fulfillment. For instance, some Christian theologians argue that if their faith *arrives* later than the indigenous religion, even if in history Christianity came first, such indigenous systems were ""God's placeholder,"" often with common truths learned from nature mixed with erroneous revelatory truths, that can be fulfilled and corrected with the revealed truth of the Christian Scriptures.
Proponents of this view include Karl Rahner, whose appreciation of the phrase ""all grace is Christ's grace"" led him to the controversial theory of ""anonymous Christians"" - those who are already saved by the light they have, yet have not yet heard the gospel.


=== The Mutuality Model ===
This model admits that an admixture of truth, error, and incompleteness of revelation exists in all religions, and we need one another to understand and find the truth. While this is a type of pluralism, it does not go so far as to admit that everyone is right, or that there is no objective truth - it only admits that we must learn from one another to find it. It may be that one or another faith is wrong on even major doctrines - but it is also right and has some value in contributing to the whole.


=== The Acceptance Model ===
This is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths may lead to God, and no one can affirm surely that their way is correct. We must all learn from one another, and pull back from making any absolute claims about spiritual matters. The acceptance model takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for any given individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.

Wood,"Wood is a structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere, such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, woodchips, or fiber.
Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate.
As of 2020, the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 557 billion cubic meters. As an abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. In 2008, approximately 3.97 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.
Wood is scientifically studied and researched through the discipline of wood science, which was initiated since the beginning of the 20th century.


== History ==
A 2011 discovery in the Canadian province of New Brunswick yielded the earliest known plants to have grown wood, approximately 395 to 400 million years ago.
Wood can be dated by carbon dating and in some species by dendrochronology to determine when a wooden object was created.
People have used wood for thousands of years for many purposes, including as a fuel or as a construction material for making houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, artworks, and paper. Known constructions using wood date back ten thousand years. Buildings like the longhouses in Neolithic Europe were made primarily of wood.
Recent use of wood has been enhanced by the addition of steel and bronze into construction.
The year-to-year variation in tree-ring widths and isotopic abundances gives clues to the prevailing climate at the time a tree was cut.


== Physical properties ==


=== Growth rings ===

Wood, in the strict sense, is yielded by trees, which increase in diameter by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner bark, of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as secondary growth; it is the result of cell division in the vascular cambium, a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
Where the differences between the seasons are distinct, e.g. New Zealand, growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to growth rings; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If the distinctiveness between seasons is annual (as is the case in equatorial regions, e.g. Singapore), these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is little seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.  If the bark of the tree has been removed in a particular area, the rings will likely be deformed as the plant overgrows the scar.
If there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood. There are major differences, depending on the kind of wood. If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of soil and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern oaks, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. On the whole, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.


=== Knots ===

As a tree grows, lower branches often die, and their bases may become overgrown and enclosed by subsequent layers of trunk wood, forming a type of imperfection known as a knot. The dead branch may not be attached to the trunk wood except at its base and can drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards. Knots affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing tension strength, but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular ""solid"" (usually darker) piece of wood around which the grain of the rest of the wood ""flows"" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.
In the tree a knot is either the base of a side branch or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.
In grading lumber and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.

Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or tension than when under load along the grain and/or compression. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a beam depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small knots may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal shearing. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.
Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber; this will depend on the size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.
In some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is painted, such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot primer paint or solution (knotting), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.


=== Heartwood and sapwood ===

Heartwood (or duramen) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay. Heartwood formation is a genetically programmed process that occurs spontaneously. Some uncertainty exists as to whether the wood dies during heartwood formation, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.
The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Some others never form heartwood.
Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings. For example, it is sometimes much darker. Other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.
Sapwood (or alburnum) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood, and its principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. By the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, 30 cm (12 in) or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second growth hickory, or open-grown pines.

No definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.
When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.
Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.


=== Color ===

In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply a significant difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.
Some experiments on very resinous longleaf pine specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the resin which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called ""fat lighter"". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and termites, and very flammable. Tree stumps of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. Spruce impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.
Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.
Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western hemlock is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain rot-producing fungi impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.


=== Water content ===
Water occurs in living wood in three locations, namely:

in the cell walls
in the protoplasmic contents of the cells
as free water in the cell cavities and spaces, especially of the xylem

In heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried (in equilibrium with the moisture content of the air) retains 8–16% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.
The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect. The moisture in wood can be measured by several different moisture meters.
Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry spruce block 5 cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.
The greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at elastic limit in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the modulus of elasticity is least affected.


=== Structure ===

Wood is a heterogeneous, hygroscopic, cellular and anisotropic (or more specifically, orthotropic) material. It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of cellulose (40–50%) and hemicellulose (15–25%) impregnated with lignin (15–30%).
In coniferous or softwood species the wood cells are mostly of one kind, tracheids, and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods. There are no vessels (""pores"") in coniferous wood such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.
The structure of hardwoods is more complex. The water conducting capability is mostly taken care of by vessels: in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash) these are quite large and distinct, in others (buckeye, poplar, willow) too small to be seen without a hand lens. In discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes, ring-porous and diffuse-porous.
In ring-porous species, such as ash, black locust, catalpa, chestnut, elm, hickory, mulberry, and oak, the larger vessels or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) are localized in the part of the growth ring formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers. These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.
In diffuse-porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row. Examples of this kind of wood are alder, basswood, birch, buckeye, maple, willow, and the Populus species such as aspen, cottonwood and poplar. Some species, such as walnut and cherry, are on the border between the two classes, forming an intermediate group.


=== Earlywood and latewood ===


==== In softwood ====

In temperate softwoods, there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.
If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.
It is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain less latewood. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.
No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.


==== In ring-porous woods ====

In ring-porous woods, each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.
In the case of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.
In ring-porous woods of good growth, it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from six to ten percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.
Wide-ringed wood is often called ""second-growth"", because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such ""second-growth"" hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and spokes. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important.
The results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:

""The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough.""
The effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarized by the same authority as follows:

""When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter.""


==== In diffuse-porous woods ====
In the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.
In diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general, it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.


=== Monocots ===

Structural material that resembles ordinary, ""dicot"" or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of monocot plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, bamboo, botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material and in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and veneer. Another major plant group that produces material that often is called wood are the palms. Of much less importance are plants such as Pandanus, Dracaena and Cordyline. With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.


=== Specific gravity ===
The single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986), as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm3 or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as basic specific gravity (Timell 1986).
The U.S. Forest Products Laboratory lists a variety of ways to define specific gravity (G) and density (ρ) for wood:

The FPL has adopted Gb and G12 for specific gravity, in accordance with the ASTM D2555 standard. These are scientifically useful, but don't represent any condition that could physically occur. The FPL Wood Handbook also provides formulas for approximately converting any of these measurements to any other.


=== Density ===

Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into ""one fairly easily measured wood characteristic"" (Elliott 1970).
Age, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, silvicultural treatment, and seed source all to some degree influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986). Variation of specific gravity within the bole of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.
Because the specific gravity as defined above uses an unrealistic condition, woodworkers tend to use the ""average dried weight"", which is a density based on mass at 12% moisture content and volume at the same (ρ12). This condition occurs when the wood is at equilibrium moisture content with air at about 65% relative humidity and temperature at 30 °C (86 °F). This density is expressed in units of kg/m3 or lbs/ft3.


=== Tables ===
The following tables list the mechanical properties of wood and lumber plant species, including bamboo. See also Mechanical properties of tonewoods for additional properties.
Wood properties:

Bamboo properties:


== Hard versus soft ==
It is common to classify wood as either softwood or hardwood. The wood from conifers (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from dicotyledons (usually broad-leaved trees, e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. yew) are harder than many hardwoods.
There is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it, at least for certain species. For example, in loblolly pine, wind exposure and stem position greatly affect the hardness of wood, as well as compression wood content. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, mahogany is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas balsa is light, making it useful for model building. One of the densest woods is black ironwood.


== Chemistry ==

The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements (mainly calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, and manganese) by weight. Wood also contains sulfur, chlorine, silicon, phosphorus, and other elements in small quantity.
Aside from water, wood has three main components. Cellulose, a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41–43%. Next in abundance is hemicellulose, which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly five-carbon sugars that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. Lignin is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on aromatic rings. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.
In chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent lignin. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from sinapyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol. Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.


=== Extractives ===
Aside from the structural polymers, i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin (lignocellulose), wood contains a large variety of non-structural constituents, composed of low molecular weight organic compounds, called extractives. These compounds are present in the extracellular space and can be extracted from the wood using different neutral solvents, such as acetone. Analogous content is present in the so-called exudate produced by trees in response to mechanical damage or after being attacked by insects or fungi. Unlike the structural constituents, the composition of extractives varies over wide ranges and depends on many factors. The amount and composition of extractives differs between tree species, various parts of the same tree, and depends on genetic factors and growth conditions, such as climate and geography. For example, slower growing trees and higher parts of trees have higher content of extractives. Generally, the softwood is richer in extractives than the hardwood. Their concentration increases from the cambium to the pith. Barks and branches also contain extractives. Although extractives represent a small fraction of the wood content, usually less than 10%, they are extraordinarily diverse and thus characterize the",1
Credit,"When somebody borrows resources from somebody else, credit is the trust that they will later pay it back. The term often is used when somebody borrows money from a bank. This is called a loan. A bank may not give somebody credit if they do not think they would pay the loan back.


== Credit cards ==

A bank or a credit union can give somebody a credit card. This is a card somebody can use when they are buying something instead of using cash. Credit cards are given on the trust they will pay the bank or credit union.

Miracle,"A miracle is an amazing, beneficial event that goes (or at least seems to go) against natural laws.  Some people say that a miracle is always an act brought about by God or other supernatural force (such as an angel). Others say that there can always be another explanation for it. And thirdly, some say the event is myth and never actually even happened in the first place.


== According to the Bible ==
In the Bible a miracle is an act by God, where God's presence is shown. They can be an act that affects one person, or a gigantic disturbance of nature that changes the world.


=== Examples in the Bible ===
Here are seven types that can be found. These are just some of the many miracles in the Bible.

God's authority
Moses parts the Red Sea so that the people of Israel could escape from Egypt
Jesus commands the storm winds to stop blowing
Healing
A man crippled since birth gets up and walks after Jesus heals him
Jesus makes a man who was born blind to see
Judgment for evil
People became so evil that God destroys them with a flood; Noah and his family are saved
Two members of the Jerusalem church are struck dead for lying
Provision
God gives manna to the Israelites as they traveled through the desert
Jesus feeds thousands of people with only five loaves of bread and two fish
Raising the dead
By the power of God, Elijah raises a widow’s dead son back to life
Jesus raises his friend, Lazarus, to life
Safety
King Nebuchadnezzar tries to burn Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to death in a fiery furnace, but God keeps them from burning
Visions
The prophet Isaiah has a vision of God seated on his throne surrounded by angels
Saul has a vision of Jesus that changed his life


== In other books ==
Other religious books, like the Quran, Mahabharata and the Avesta, contains many references to this definition of miracle. An example of a miracle in the Quran is when Muhammad splits the moon into halves.

Money services business,"A money services business (MSB) is a legal term used by financial regulators to describe businesses that transmit or convert money.  The definition was created to encompass more than just banks which normally provide these services to include non-bank financial institutions.
An MSB has specific meanings in different jurisdictions, but generally includes any business that transmits money or representatives of money, provides foreign currency exchange such as Bureaux de change, or cashes cheques or other money related instruments.  It is often used in the context of Anti Money Laundering (AML) legislation and rules. Money services businesses are regulated in different countries differently. They governed by their local regulators and have to adhere with record-keeping requirements to conduct customer due diligence if customers request for an amount of foreign currency that exceeds a certain threshold set to detect money laundering.
An MSB often provides an essential financial service to underdeveloped regions with limited or no banking services and may be a small organisation with outlets like grocery stores, drugstores, pharmacies or convenience stores. It may include regional networks of post offices, banks or agents.

Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit,"The Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit is a work by Photius I who was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople (858 to 867 and 877 to 886). The work concerns the Procession of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity. 

Photius argues against the idea that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son (as proclaimed in the Western Creed under the Filioque clause) but rather, like the Son, proceeds only from the Father. ""...if — as this blasphemy cries out — the Spirit also proceeds from the Son, then why not simply tear up the Word [Logos] and propagate the fable that the Spirit also produces the Son, thereby according the same equality of rank to each hypostasis by allowing each hypostasis to produce the other hypostasis?"" Daniel Akin summerises it as formulating the doctrine of monopatrism generally accepted by the East and says that Photius points out that the Double Procession verges on Modalism: ""If the Spirit proceeds from the common nature, as the West taught, then he absurdly proceeds from himself... When Scripture speaks of the 'Spirit of Christ', it is not referring to procession but to the Spirit having annointed Christ"".Howard Watkin-Jones  calls the book ""an example of his dialectical powers and also of the faculty of plausible presentation"". He points out that the book almost exclusively concentrares on the Procession without reference to the work of the Holy Spirit, which he asserts is typical of Greek theology. He finally concludes that the argument in the work epitomise the thought of the  ""Eastern mind with reference to this keen theological issue"".
The first English translation, by Holy Transfiguration Monastery, was published in 1983. Another translation was published in 1987 with a preface by Archimandrite (now Archbishop) Chrysostomos of Etna.

It could even include molecular nanobots to repair damage brought on by aging.

Col legno,"In music for bowed string instruments, col legno, or more precisely col legno battuto (Italian for 'with the wood [being hit]'; pronounced [kol ˈleɲɲo batˈtuːto]), is an instruction to strike the string with the stick of the bow across the strings.


== History ==
The earliest known use of col legno in Western music is to be found in a piece entitled ""Harke, harke,"" from the First Part of Ayres (1605) by Tobias Hume, where he instructs the gambist to ""drum this with the backe of your bow"".


== Sound ==
The percussive sound of battuto has a clear pitch element determined by the distance of the bow from the bridge at the point of contact. As a group of players will never strike the string in exactly the same place, the sound of a section of violins playing col legno battuto is dramatically different from the sound of a single violin doing so.
The wood of the bow can also be drawn across the string — a technique called col legno tratto (""with the wood drawn""). This is much less common, and the plain marking col legno is invariably interpreted to mean battuto rather than tratto. The sound produced by col legno tratto is very quiet, with an overlay of white noise, but the pitch of the stopped note can be clearly heard. If the sound is too quiet, the bow can be slightly rolled so that a few bow hairs touch the string as well, leading to a slightly less ""airy"" sound.


== Equipment ==
Some string players object to col legno playing as it can damage the bow; many players have a cheaper bow which they use for such passages, or for pieces which require extended passages. Some players tap the strings with pencils instead of bows, producing a further percussive, lighter sound.

Autoignition temperature,"The autoignition temperature or self-ignition temperature, often called spontaneous ignition temperature or minimum ignition temperature (or shortly ignition temperature) and formerly also known as kindling point, of a substance is the lowest temperature at which it spontaneously ignites in a normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or spark. This temperature is required to supply the activation energy needed for combustion. The temperature at which a chemical ignites decreases as the pressure is increased. 

Substances which spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere at naturally ambient temperatures are termed pyrophoric.
Autoignition temperatures of liquid chemicals are typically measured using a 500-millilitre (18 imp fl oz; 17 US fl oz) flask placed in a temperature-controlled oven in accordance with the procedure described in ASTM E659.
When measured for plastics, autoignition temperature can also be measured under elevated pressure and at 100% oxygen concentration. The resulting value is used as a predictor of viability for high-oxygen service. The main testing standard for this is ASTM G72.

== Autoignition temperature of selected substances ==
Temperatures vary widely in the literature and should only be used as estimates. Factors that may cause variation include partial pressure of oxygen, altitude, humidity, and amount of time required for ignition. Generally the autoignition temperature for hydrocarbon/air mixtures decreases with increasing molecular mass and increasing chain length. The autoignition temperature is also higher for branched-chain hydrocarbons than for straight-chain hydrocarbons.

Palliative care,"Palliative care is care for people approaching the end of life.  It is designed to improve the quality of their life. It is not only for people near the end of life, but for people with problems that are not thought to be curable.  According to the World Health Organization it should include the treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual.   Treatment that is designed to cure people may be unpleasant and often neglects problems which are not medical. 
Medical treatment is to deal with the symptoms of an illness.  There may be counselling or therapy, which may include a chaplain, or pets, to deal with a person's worries.  There is a lot more attention to dealing with pain than in curative treatment. 
This care may happen in the person's own home, a hospital or a hospice. In the United States, hospice treatment is a benefit provided by the federal government since 1982.  In other countries a hospice is a specialized service often from a charity.   Even in the richest countries only a minority of people get any palliative care.

Digital theology,"Digital theology or cybertheology is the study of the relationship between theology and the digital technology.


== Terminology ==
In Catholic discourse, the more dominant term has been cybertheology. There has also been the yearly Theocom symposium since 2012 at Santa Clara University, which has explored topics related to theology and digital communications.
In more recent discourse related to digital humanities and digital religion, some scholars have begun to use the term ""digital theology."" They identify four kinds of digital theology:

Digital technology as a pedagogical tool to teach theology
Digital technology that opens new methods for theological research
Theological reflection on digitality or digital culture
The reappraisal and critique of digitality based on theological ethics
They also suggest a fifth aspect of digital theology, which offers a more integrated yet critical use of digital technology in the study of theology and religious belief and practice.
However, as digital theology is a burgeoning field, much of the literature has been critiqued as having a poor understanding of technology and digital culture.


== Digital church ==
Much of the research on digital theology relates to church communities online. Some studies have explored churches which only have online existence, whereas others explore the relationship between how people connect through online and offline communities. Often the conversation is around the nature of Christian worship and how it changes when in an online format.
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, many churches have needed to implement social distancing measures and make choices to run services online. However, these decisions were often made quite haphazardly and for practical reasons, as opposed to more considered choices about the implications of digitizing church services. This has resulted in growing revived discussions around what it means to be a church and what being socially distant and being online does to ecclesiology.

Barter,"Barter is trading one thing for another without using money. Usually the things that are traded are worth the same amount of money, but no money is used in the trade.
Barter is useful when two people each have something the other wants, so they agree on an amount of stuff and then swap it. This can also happen with services, for example a plumber can fix a tap in a winery and be given a crate of wine.
Barter and money have been practiced longer than history has, so there is little historic evidence of the change. However, the usual idea is that barter came earlier and money arose to solve a problem: One person may not want what the other person has. For instance, Bob needs a new pair of shoes and John has those shoes. But Bob has eggs and John needs milk. This is where money becomes useful because anything can be traded for a set amount of money. Bob could pay John for the shoes and John could go to the store and buy some milk.

Luminous flame,"A luminous flame is a burning flame which is brightly visible. Much of its output is in the form of visible light, as well as heat or light in the non-visible wavelengths.
An early study of flame luminosity was conducted by Michael Faraday and became part of his series of Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, The Chemical History of a Candle.


== Luminosity ==

In the simplest case, the yellow flame is luminous due to small soot particles in the flame which are heated to incandescence. Producing a deliberately luminous flame requires either a shortage of combustion air (as in a Bunsen burner) or a local excess of fuel (as for a kerosene torch). Because of this dependency upon relatively inefficient combustion, luminosity is associated with diffusion flames and is lessened with premixed flames.
The flame is yellow because of its temperature. To produce enough soot to be luminous, the flame is operated at a lower temperature than its efficient heating flame (see Bunsen burner). The colour of simple incandescence is due to black-body radiation. By Planck's law, as the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to longer wavelengths, i.e. from the blue to the yellow. However, the blue light from a gas burner's premixed flame is primarily a product of molecular emission (Swan bands) rather than black-body radiation.
Other factors, particularly the fuel chemistry and its propensity for forming soot, have an influence on luminosity.


== Bunsen burner ==

One of the most familiar instances of a luminous flame is produced by a Bunsen burner. This burner has a controllable air supply and a constant gas jet: when the air supply is reduced, a highly luminous, and thus visible, orange 'safety flame' is produced. For heating work, the air inlet is opened and the burner produces a much hotter blue flame.


== Combustion efficiency ==
Efficient combustion relies on the complete combustion of the fuel. Production of soot and/or carbon monoxide represents a waste of fuel (further burning was possible) the potential problem of soot build-up in burners. Heating burners are thus usually designed to produce a non-luminous flame.


== Oil lamps ==
Lamps for illumination rather than heat may use a deliberately luminous flame. A more efficient method overall uses a mantle instead. Like the incandescent soot in a luminous flame, the mantle is heated and then glows. The flame does not provide much light itself, and so a more heat-efficient non-luminous flame is preferred. Unlike simple soot, a mantle uses rare-earth elements to provide a bright white glow; the colour of the glow comes from the spectral lines of these elements, not from simple black-body radiation.


== Flame testing ==
When performing a flame test, the colour of a flame is affected by external materials added to it. A non-luminous flame is used, to avoid masking the test colour by the flame's colour.

Outline of sculpture,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to sculpture:
A sculpture – human-made three-dimensional art object.
Sculpture or sculpting – activity of creating sculptures.  A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor.


== What type of thing is sculpture? ==
Sculpture can be described as all of the following:

Art – aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word ""art"" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term ""sculpture"".
Work of art – aesthetic physical item or artistic creation.
One of the arts – as an art form, sculpture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Sculpture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
A branch of the visual arts – visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
Fine art – in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word ""fine"" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.

Travelers' diarrhea,"Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is a stomach and intestinal infection. TD is defined as the passage of unformed stool (one or more by some definitions, three or more by others) while traveling. It may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, headache and bloating. Occasionally bloody diarrhea may occur. Most travelers recover within three to four days with little or no treatment. About 12% of people may have symptoms for a week.
Bacteria are responsible for more than half of cases, typically via foodborne illness and waterborne diseases. The bacteria enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are typically the most common except in Southeast Asia, where Campylobacter is more prominent. About 10 to 20 percent of cases are due to norovirus. Protozoa such as Giardia may cause longer term disease. The risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults. People affected are more often from the developed world.
Recommendations for prevention include eating only properly cleaned and cooked food, drinking bottled water, and frequent hand washing. The oral cholera vaccine, while effective for cholera, is of questionable use for travelers' diarrhea. Preventive antibiotics are generally discouraged. Primary treatment includes rehydration and replacing lost salts (oral rehydration therapy). Antibiotics are recommended for significant or persistent symptoms, and can be taken with loperamide to decrease diarrhea. Hospitalization is required in less than 3 percent of cases.
Estimates of the percentage of people affected range from 20 to 50 percent among travelers to the developing world. TD is particularly common among people traveling to Asia (except for Japan and Singapore), the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Central and South America. The risk is moderate in Southern Europe, and Russia. TD has been linked to later irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain–Barré syndrome. It has colloquially been known by a number of names, including ""Montezuma's revenge,"" “mummy tummy” and ""Delhi belly"".


== Signs and symptoms ==
The onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel, but may occur at any time while traveling, and even after returning home, depending on the incubation period of the infectious agent. Bacterial TD typically begins abruptly, but Cryptosporidium may incubate for seven days, and Giardia for 14 days or more, before symptoms develop. Typically, a traveler experiences four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are abdominal cramping, bloating, fever, and malaise. Appetite may decrease significantly.  Though unpleasant, most cases of TD are mild, and resolve in a few days without medical intervention.
Blood or mucus in the diarrhea, significant abdominal pain, or high fever suggests a more serious cause, such as cholera, characterized by a rapid onset of weakness and torrents of watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (described as ""rice water"" stools). Medical care should be sought in such cases; dehydration is a serious consequence of cholera, and may trigger serious sequelae—including, in rare instances, death—as rapidly as 24 hours after onset if not addressed promptly.


== Causes ==

Infectious agents are the primary cause of travelers' diarrhea. Bacterial enteropathogens cause about 80% of cases.  Viruses and protozoans account for most of the rest.
The most common causative agent isolated in countries surveyed has been enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Enteroaggregative E. coli is increasingly recognized. Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. are other common bacterial pathogens.  Campylobacter, Yersinia, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas spp. are less frequently found. Mechanisms of action vary: some bacteria release toxins which bind to the intestinal wall and cause diarrhea; others damage the intestines themselves by their direct presence.
Brachyspira pilosicoli pathogen also appears to be responsible for many chronic intermittent watery diarrhea and is only diagnosed through colonic biopsies and microscopic discovery of a false brush border  on H&E or Warthin silver stain: its brush-border is stronger and longer that Brachyspira aalborgi's brush-border. It is unfortunately often not diagnosed as coproculture does not allow growth and 16S PCR panel primers do not match Brachyspira sequences.
While viruses are associated with less than 20% of adult cases of travelers' diarrhea, they may be responsible for nearly 70% of cases in infants and children. Diarrhea due to viral agents is unaffected by antibiotic therapy, but is usually self-limited.  Protozoans such as Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora cayetanensis can also cause diarrhea. Pathogens commonly implicated in travelers' diarrhea appear in the table in this section.
A subtype of travelers' diarrhea afflicting hikers and campers, sometimes known as wilderness diarrhea, may have a somewhat different frequency of distribution of pathogens.


=== Risk factors ===
The primary source of infection is ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water. Attack rates are similar for men and women.
The most important determinant of risk is the traveler's destination. High-risk destinations include developing countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Among backpackers, additional risk factors include drinking untreated surface water and failure to maintain personal hygiene practices and clean cookware. Campsites often have very primitive (if any) sanitation facilities, making them potentially as dangerous as any developing country.
Although travelers' diarrhea usually resolves within three to five days (mean duration: 3.6 days), in about 20% of cases, the illness is severe enough to require bedrest, and in 10%, the illness duration exceeds one week.  For those prone to serious infections, such as  bacillary dysentery, amoebic dysentery, and cholera, TD can occasionally be life-threatening.  Others at higher-than-average risk include young adults, immunosuppressed persons, persons with inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes, and those taking H2 blockers or antacids.


=== Immunity ===
Travelers often get diarrhea from eating and drinking foods and beverages that have no adverse effects on local residents. This is due to immunity that develops with constant, repeated exposure to pathogenic organisms. The extent and duration of exposure necessary to acquire immunity has not been determined; it may vary with each individual organism. A study among expatriates in Nepal suggests that immunity may take up to seven years to develop—presumably in adults who avoid deliberate pathogen exposure.
Conversely, immunity acquired by American students while living in Mexico disappeared, in one study, as quickly as eight weeks after cessation of exposure.


== Prevention ==


=== Sanitation ===
Recommendations include avoidance of questionable foods and drinks, on the assumption that TD is fundamentally a sanitation failure, leading to bacterial contamination of drinking water and food. While the effectiveness of this strategy has been questioned, given that travelers have little or no control over sanitation in hotels and restaurants, and little evidence supports the contention that food vigilance reduces the risk of contracting TD, guidelines continue to recommend basic, common-sense precautions when making food and beverage choices:

Maintain good hygiene and use only safe water for drinking and brushing teeth.
Safe beverages include bottled water, bottled carbonated beverages, and water boiled or appropriately treated by the traveler (as described below). Caution should be exercised with tea, coffee, and other hot beverages that may be only heated, not boiled.
In restaurants, insist that bottled water be unsealed in your presence; reports of locals filling empty bottles with untreated tap water and reselling them as purified water have surfaced. When in doubt, a bottled carbonated beverage is the safest choice, since it is difficult to simulate carbonation when refilling a used bottle.
Avoid ice, which may not have been made with safe water.
Avoid green salads, because the lettuce and other uncooked ingredients are unlikely to have been washed with safe water.
Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables unless cleaned and peeled personally.
If handled properly, thoroughly cooked fresh and packaged foods are usually safe. Raw or undercooked meat and seafood should be avoided. Unpasteurized milk, dairy products, mayonnaise, and pastry icing are associated with increased risk for TD, as are foods and beverages purchased from street vendors and other establishments where unhygienic conditions may be present.


=== Water ===
Although safe bottled water is now widely available in most remote destinations, travelers can treat their own water if necessary, or as an extra precaution.
Techniques include boiling, filtering, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet light; boiling is by far the most effective of these methods. Boiling rapidly kills all active bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Prolonged boiling is usually unnecessary; most microorganisms are killed within seconds at water temperature above 55–70 °C (131–158 °F). The second-most effective method is to combine filtration and chemical disinfection.  Filters eliminate most bacteria and protozoa, but not viruses. Chemical treatment with halogens—chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine, or commercial tablets—have low-to-moderate effectiveness against protozoa such as Giardia, but work well against bacteria and viruses.
UV light is effective against both viruses and cellular organisms, but only works in clear water, and it is ineffective unless manufacturer's instructions are carefully followed for maximum water depth/distance from UV source, and for dose/exposure time. Other claimed advantages include short treatment time, elimination of the need for boiling, no taste alteration, and decreased long-term cost compared with bottled water. The effectiveness of UV devices is reduced when water is muddy or turbid; as UV is a type of light, any suspended particles create shadows that hide microorganisms from UV exposure.


=== Medications ===
Bismuth subsalicylate four times daily reduces rates of travelers' diarrhea. Though many travelers find a four-times-per-day regimen inconvenient, lower doses are not effective. Potential side effects include black tongue, black stools, nausea, constipation, and ringing in the ears. Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken by those with aspirin allergy, kidney disease, or gout, nor concurrently with certain antibiotics such as the quinolones, and should not be taken continuously for more than three weeks. Some countries do not recommend it due to the risk of rare but serious side effects.
A hyperimmune bovine colostrum to be taken by mouth is marketed in Australia for prevention of ETEC-induced TD. As yet, no studies show efficacy under actual travel conditions.
Though effective, antibiotics are not recommended for the prevention of TD in most situations because of the risk of allergy or adverse reactions to the antibiotics, and because intake of preventive antibiotics may decrease the effectiveness of such drugs should a serious infection develop subsequently. Antibiotics can also cause vaginal yeast infections, or overgrowth of the bacterium Clostridioides difficile, leading to pseudomembranous colitis and its associated severe, unrelenting diarrhea.
Antibiotics may be warranted in special situations where benefits outweigh the above risks, such as immunocompromised travelers, chronic intestinal disorders, prior history of repeated disabling bouts of TD, or scenarios in which the onset of diarrhea might prove particularly troublesome. Options for prophylactic treatment include the fluoroquinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin), azithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, though the latter has proved less effective in recent years.  Rifaximin may also be useful.  Quinolone antibiotics may bind to metallic cations such as bismuth, and should not be taken concurrently with bismuth subsalicylate. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should not be taken by anyone with a history of sulfa allergy.


=== Vaccination ===
The oral cholera vaccine, while effective for prevention of cholera, is of questionable use for prevention of TD. A 2008 review found tentative evidence of benefit. A 2015 review stated it may be reasonable for those at high risk of complications from TD. Several vaccine candidates targeting ETEC or Shigella are in various stages of development.


=== Probiotics ===
One 2007 review found that probiotics may be safe and effective for prevention of TD, while another review found no benefit. A 2009 review confirmed that more study is needed, as the evidence to date is mixed.


== Treatment ==
Most cases of TD are mild and resolve in a few days without treatment, but severe or protracted cases may result in significant fluid loss and dangerous electrolytic imbalance. Dehydration due to diarrhea can also alter the effectiveness of medicinal and contraceptive drugs. Adequate fluid intake (oral rehydration therapy) is therefore a high priority. Commercial rehydration drinks are widely available; alternatively, purified water or other clear liquids are recommended, along with salty crackers or oral rehydration salts (available in stores and pharmacies in most countries) to replenish lost electrolytes. Carbonated water or soda, left open to allow dissipation of the carbonation, is useful when nothing else is available.  In severe or protracted cases, the oversight of a medical professional is advised.


=== Antibiotics ===
If diarrhea becomes severe (typically defined as three or more loose stools in an eight-hour period), especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools, medical treatment should be sought. Such patients may benefit from antimicrobial therapy.  A 2000 literature review found that antibiotic treatment shortens the duration and severity of TD; most reported side effects were minor, or resolved on stopping the antibiotic.
The antibiotic recommended varies based upon the destination of travel. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are no longer recommended because of high levels of resistance to these agents. Antibiotics are typically given for three to five days, but single doses of azithromycin or levofloxacin have been used.  Rifaximin and rifamycin are approved in the U.S. for treatment of TD caused by ETEC. If diarrhea persists despite therapy, travelers should be evaluated for bacterial strains resistant to the prescribed antibiotic, possible viral or parasitic infections, bacterial or amoebic dysentery, Giardia, helminths, or cholera.


=== Antimotility agents ===
Antimotility drugs such as loperamide and diphenoxylate reduce the symptoms of diarrhea by slowing transit time in the gut. They may be taken to slow the frequency of stools, but not enough to stop bowel movements completely, which delays expulsion of the causative organisms from the intestines. They should be avoided in patients with fever, bloody diarrhea, and possible inflammatory diarrhea. Adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hives or rash, and loss of appetite. Antimotility agents should not, as a rule, be taken by children under age two.


== Epidemiology ==
An estimated 10 million people—20 to 50% of international travelers—develop TD each year.  It is more common in the developing world, where rates exceed 60%, but has been reported in some form in virtually every travel destination in the world.


== Society and culture ==
Moctezuma's revenge is a colloquial term for travelers' diarrhea contracted in Mexico. The name refers to Moctezuma II (1466–1520), the Tlatoani (ruler) of the Aztec civilization who was overthrown by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in the early 16th century, thereby bringing large portions of what is now Mexico and Central America under the rule of the Spanish crown. The relevance being that Cortés and his soldiers carried the smallpox virus, which Mexicans had never been exposed to. The resulting infection reduced the population of Tenochtitlan by 40 percent in 1520 alone.


== Wilderness diarrhea ==

Wilderness diarrhea, also called wilderness-acquired diarrhea (WAD) or backcountry diarrhea, refers to diarrhea among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists in wilderness or backcountry situations, either at home or abroad.  It is caused by the same fecal microorganisms as other forms of travelers' diarrhea, usually bacterial or viral. Since wilderness campsites seldom provide access to sanitation facilities, the infection risk is similar to that of any developing country.  Water treatment, good hygiene, and dish washing have all been shown to reduce the incidence of WAD.

Software intelligence,"Software intelligence is insight into the inner workings and structural condition of software assets produced by software designed to analyze database structure, software framework and source code to better understand and control complex software systems in information technology environments. Similarly to business intelligence (BI), software intelligence is produced by a set of software tools and techniques for the mining of data and the software's inner-structure. Results are automatically produced and feed a knowledge base containing technical documentation and blueprints of the innerworking of applications, and make it available to all to be used by business and software stakeholders to make informed decisions, measure the efficiency of software development organizations, communicate about the software health, prevent software catastrophes.


== History ==
Software intelligence has been used by Kirk Paul Lafler, an American engineer, entrepreneur, and consultant, and founder of Software Intelligence Corporation in 1979. At that time, it was mainly related to SAS activities, in which he has been an expert since 1979.
In the early 1980s, Victor R. Basili participated in different papers detailing a methodology for collecting valid software engineering data relating to software engineering, evaluation of software development, and variations.

In 2004, different software vendors in software analysis started using the terms as part of their product naming and marketing strategy.
Then in 2010, Ahmed E. Hassan and Tao Xie defined software intelligence as a ""practice offering software practitioners up-to-date and pertinent information to support their daily decision-making processes and Software Intelligence should support decision-making processes throughout the lifetime of a software system"". They go on by defining software intelligence as a ""strong impact on modern software practice"" for the upcoming decades.


== Capabilities ==
Because of the complexity and wide range of components and subjects implied in software, software intelligence is derived from different aspects of software:

Software composition is the construction of software application components. Components result from software coding, as well as the integration of the source code from external components: Open source, 3rd party components, or frameworks. Other components can be integrated using application programming interface call to libraries or services.
Software architecture refers to the structure and organization of elements of a system, relations, and properties among them.
Software flaws designate problems that can cause security, stability, resiliency, and unexpected results. There is no standard definition of software flaws but the most accepted is from The MITRE Corporation where common flaws are cataloged as Common Weakness Enumeration.
Software grades assess attributes of the software. Historically, the classification and terminology of attributes have been derived from the ISO 9126-3 and the subsequent ISO 25000:2005 quality model.
Software economics refers to the resource evaluation of software in the past, present, or future to make decisions and to govern.


== Components ==
The capabilities of software intelligence platforms include an increasing number of components:

Code analyzer to serve as an information basis for other software intelligence components identifying objects created by the programming language, external objects from Open source, third parties objects, frameworks, API, or services
Graphical visualization and blueprinting of the inner structure of the software product or application considered including dependencies, from data acquisition (automated and real-time data capture, end-user entries) up to data storage, the different layers within the software, and the coupling between all elements.
Navigation capabilities within components and impact analysis features
List of flaws, architectural and coding violations, against standardized best practices, cloud blocker  preventing migration to a Cloud environment, and rogue data-call entailing the security and integrity of software 
Grades or scores of the structural and software quality aligned with industry-standard like OMG, CISQ or SEI assessing the reliability, security, efficiency, maintainability, and scalability to cloud or other systems.
Metrics quantifying and estimating software economics including work effort, sizing, and technical debt
Industry references and benchmarking allowing comparisons between outputs of analysis and industry standards


== User aspect ==
Some considerations must be made in order to successfully integrate the usage of software Intelligence systems in a company. Ultimately the software intelligence system must be accepted and utilized by the users in order for it to add value to the organization. If the system does not add value to the users' mission, they simply don't use it as stated by M. Storey in 2003.
At the code level and system representation, software intelligence systems must provide a different level of abstractions: an abstract view for designing, explaining and documenting and a detailed view for understanding and analyzing the software system.
At the governance level, the user acceptance for software intelligence covers different areas related to the inner functioning of the system as well as the output of the system. It encompasses these requirements: 

Comprehensive: missing information may lead to a wrong or inappropriate decision, as well as it is a factor influencing the user acceptance of a system.
Accurate: accuracy depends on how the data is collected to ensure fair and indisputable opinion and judgment.
Precise: precision is usually judged by comparing several measurements from the same or different sources.
Scalable: lack of scalability in the software industry is a critical factor leading to failure.
Credible: outputs must be trusted and believed.
Deploy-able and usable.


== Applications ==
Software intelligence has many applications in all businesses relating to the software environment, whether it is software for professionals, individuals, or embedded software.
Depending on the association and the usage of the components, applications will relate to:

Change and modernization: uniform documentation and blueprinting on all inner components, external code integrated, or call to internal or external components of the software
Resiliency and security: measuring against industry standards to diagnose structural flaws in an IT environment. Compliance validation regarding security, specific regulations or technical matters.
Decisions making and governance: Providing analytics about the software itself or stakeholders involved in the development of the software, e.g. productivity measurement to inform business and IT leaders about progress towards business goals.
Assessment and Benchmarking to help business and IT leaders to make informed, fact-based decision about software.


== Marketplace ==
Software intelligence is a high-level discipline and has been gradually growing covering the applications listed above. There are several markets driving the need for it: 

Application Portfolio Analysis (APA) aiming at improving the enterprise performance.
Software Assessment for producing the software KPI and improving quality and productivity.
Software security and resiliency measures and validation.
Software evolution or legacy modernization, for which blueprinting the software systems are needed nor tools improving and facilitating modifications.

Plywood,"Plywood is a manufactured wood which is made by gluing several thin sheets of wood together with the grain alternately running along the sheet then across it. 
The veneer is usually about 3 millimetres thick for each layer.  Interior layers of these boards are usually made from an inexpensive wood while the outer veneer layers are made from more expensive timber to give the board a nice wood grain appearance.  The glued layers are heated together to make the seal become better bonded. 
A common reason for using plywood instead of plain wood is its resistance to cracking, shrinking and changing shape.  It is cheaper than most plain woods as it reuses scrap wood, and it is stronger.
It is used to make a range of things from sheds, to cladding to cabinets. It is graded on the quality, from class A to class D, A being the best quality and D being the worst quality.
Different kinds of plywood are made for different purposes. Marine plywood, for example, is especially resistant to water. There is a world-wide industry making plywood for structural purposes. IKEA is well-known for using mostly plywood and chipboard in their indoor and outdoor furniture products.",0
Worm drive,"A worm drive is a special gear arrangement. A worm (which looks like a screw) matches up with a gearwheel. Technically, the worm transmits the motion to the gearwheel. A transmission of the motion the other way is not feasible. The design is very old. Either Archytas (5th century BC), Apollonius of Perga (3rd cenrury BC) or Archimedes (3rd century BC) invented it. The worm drive later appeared in the Indian subcontinent, for use in roller cotton gins, during the Delhi Sultanate in the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries.

Lakawood,"Lakawood, or laka wood  (Malay: kayu laka), is a reddish aromatic heartwood used as incense in China, India and South East Asia. It also had a number of other uses in the past, for example as a dye and for medicinal purposes. The name lakawood can refer to the wood of different plants, such as Acronychia pedunculata, A. Laurifolia, and in particular, Dalbergia parviflora found in South East Asia. Historically it was one of the most commonly-traded commodities of South East Asia in the trade between China and South East Asia from the Song dynasty onwards, possibly earlier.


== Names ==
The lakawood of Dalbergia parviflora is a product of the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago, and its native name in Malay is kayu laka (literally ""laka wood""), from which the words cayolaque and lakawood are derived. In old Javanese literature, the word ""laka"" was also used to denote a shade of red on cloth, and the word manglaka meant ""processor of laka-wood dye"", although the tree from which the dye was derived from is Emblica officinalis. It is also called akar laka.
In Chinese, lakawood may be called jiangzhenxiang (降真香) or zitengxiang (紫藤香). The two names referred to different types of fragrant wood in the early period, but by the early 13th century, the two names were regarded as referring to the same product. The older term ziteng (紫藤, literally ""purple vine"", note that this is distinct from wisteria which has the same name in Chinese) has been identified as a plant grown in Southern China Acronychia pedunculata and A. Laurifolia.  The fragrance from the wood was particularly appreciated by Taoists, and it therefore gained the name jiangzhenxiang meaning ""the incense that summons the Perfected Ones to descend among us"".  Historical records however used two similar terms, jiangzhenxiang and jiangzhen, which may have been two different products.  The fragrance and appearance of the heartwood and root wood from Dalbergia parviflora of South East Asia, known to have been imported into China in the 10th century, is similar to the earlier Chinese incense wood, it therefore became a substitute for the Chinese product.
Lakawood was also once referred to as Tanarius major in some English sources.


== Uses ==
The wood has been used as incense in China from an early period, and it was said to be particularly favoured by the Taoists. It is powdered and mixed with other substances to make incense, commonly in the form of joss sticks.  It was first mentioned in 304 AD as a preservative in wine and an incense wood for the summoning of spirit.  During the Tang dynasty, it was used for magical and medicinal purposes, burnt in home to rid of all that is ""weird and strange"", and pieces of the wood were attached to children to ward off ""evil vapours"".  The wood of Dalbergia parviflora has no smell until it is burnt, and only a small amount is used in joss sticks due to its strong aroma. According to 16th century herbologist and doctor Li Shizhen, it was also used ""as an astringent, as a wash to cleanse sores and to excite granulations, and as a deodorizing and disinfecting agent."" 
The sap of Emblica officinalis, also called laka, was used as a red dye by people of Java and the Malacca Strait area.  According to Zhu Fan Zhi, the red-coloured sap of lakawood was once used as an ingredient in a product called ""imitation dragon's blood"" (imitation of a product from Dracaena cinnabari).
The essential oils found in Dalbergia parviflora are nerolidol, farnesol, furfurol, aryl-benzofurans, and neoflavonoids.


== Historical records ==
Ziteng was first described in 304 AD in a book on plants, Nanfang Caomu Zhuang (Plants of the Southern Regions) written by Ji Han, as having long and slender leaves, white flower and black seed. Its wood was chopped up and used as incense. The 9th century Tang poet Cao Tang (曹唐) wrote a poem on a Taoist theme that refers to the lakawood jiangzhenxiang: ""Reddish dew gives me an image of upturning ""the wine which extends life"", Whitish smoke puts me in mind the burning of ""jiangzhenxiang"" (""the aromatic which brings down the True Ones"")"".
Lakawood from South East Asia was first noted in 982 (early Song dynasty) as one of the 37 foreign products that could be freely traded in China. Descriptions of lakawood and its trade are given in accounts from the Sung and Yuan dynasty, Zhu Fan Zhi and Daoyi Zhilüe. These texts indicate that Lakawood was a product of various states in the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Sumatra, Java, as well as Borneo. Daoyi Zhilüe also listed laka-wood as an export of the large-scale chiefdoms at Ma-li-lu (Maynila), Sulu (later the Sultanate of Sulu), and Min-to-lang (later the Sultanate of Maguindanao) in the modern-day Philippines. They suggest a significant trade in lakawood, but it was also regarded as a cheap import during the Song dynasty, such that people of Quanzhou be they rich or poor can afford to buy the incense to burn at the end of the year as a sacrifice to Heaven.  Lambri in Sumatra was mentioned as producing the best quality lakawood. Laka wood is also mentioned by Zhou Daguan in his book The Customs of Cambodia describing his trip in 1297. The value of lakawood however increased during the Ming dynasty.  The product was mentioned in accounts of Zheng He's voyages such Yingya Shenglan by Ma Huan during the Ming dynasty, and its value was considered high enough to be presented to the imperial court as tributes by various ports of Sumatra as well as Siam.

Irreligious theism,"Irreligious theism is the belief that there is a higher being, but doesn't follow organized religion, this belief can be often confused for deism, however irreligious theists often believe that god can still interfere in the world, also irreligious theists believe in supernatural events like miracles, while deists don't believe in that. The thing that is common to irreligious theism and deism is belief in the God who created the world.
Irreligious theists can pray without necessarily going through a classic group place of worship (mosques, synagogues, churches) and without physical intermediary, only by thought,or in a chosen, isolated personal place. One can believe in a personal God without believing in or subscribing to the doctrines of an organized religion.
They don't need religion to help to distinguish good from evil,  humans being have consciousness.They can live without depending on religious descriptions telling them how to behave and even sometimes hurt them in their feelings or desires for the cause described in religious books (ex: when all religions practically reject LGBT+ people, which can push them to harm themselves or even push parents to send their children to religious conversion therapies to make them ""change"" because the religious books have decreed by their writings that this was not ""correct"") and because of the religious writings it prevents people who think that they are not compatible, from linked belief in god and personal convictions feel obliged to belong to a religious group and do not think that irreligious theism can exist, and that there are no constraints or restrictions on believing in god without going through a religion.
You're also irreligious if you do believe in god but don't belong to a religious group or attend religious services. The ir- prefix, not, is attached to religious, ""believing in a religion.
A very similar, but not necessarily identical and the same view is philosophical theism, which recognizes the existence of God on the basis ofrepresents belief in God entirely without doctrine, except for that which can be discerned by reason and the contemplation of natural laws. Philosophical theism conceives of nature as the result of purposive activity and so as an intelligible system open to human understanding, although possibly never completely understandable. It implies the belief that nature is ordered according to some sort of consistent plan and manifests a single purpose or intention, however incomprehensible or inexplicable. However, philosophical theists do not endorse or adhere to the theology or doctrines of any organized religion or church. They may accept arguments or observations about the existence of a god advanced by theologians working in some religious tradition, but reject the tradition itself. (For example, a philosophical theist might believe certain Christian arguments about God while nevertheless rejecting Christianity). Philosophical theism is very similar to deism and is based on the same assumptions. The only difference is that in philosophical theism the higher being (God) is not only the creator of the world, but also something more, beyond this, in addition to this. Philosophical theism does not exclude the possibility that this higher being may sometimes somehow interfere in the world he created. What may or may not distinguish philosophical theism from very similiar irreligious theism is that in philosophical theism the belief in God is based on reason, while in irreligious theism this is not necessarily the case, in irreligious theism it can also be one's own individual faith close to religious without a rational approach and irrational.
Famous irreligious theists from history include Austrian-American mathematician, logician, and philosopher Kurt Gödel, American rapper Tupac Shakur and American author Martin Gardner.",0
Software studies,"Software studies is an emerging interdisciplinary research field, which studies software systems and their social and cultural effects. The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as cyberculture, Internet studies, new media studies, and digital culture, yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study. To study software as an artifact, software studies draws upon methods and theory from the digital humanities and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of computer science and software engineering, which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analysing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.


== History ==
The conceptual origins of software studies include Marshall McLuhan's focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in Friedrich Kittler's essay, ""Es gibt keine Software"", Lev Manovich's Language of New Media, and Matthew Fuller's Behind the Blip: Essays on the Culture of Software. Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from video game studies, particularly platform studies, the study of video games and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and computer-aided design are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.
The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.
In 2008, MIT Press launched a Software Studies book series with an edited volume of essays (Fuller's Software Studies: A Lexicon), and the first academic program was launched, (Lev Manovich, Benjamin H. Bratton, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin's ""Software Studies Initiative"" at U. California San Diego).
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established Computational Culture, an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for ""inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures.""


== Related fields ==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the digital humanities that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective. Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code. Notably related are critical code studies, which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program, and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.

Confocal endoscopy,"Confocal endoscopy, or confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), is a modern imaging technique that allows the examination of real-time microscopic and histological features inside the body. In the word ""endomicroscopy"", endo- means ""within"" and -skopein means ""to view or observe"". CLE, also known as ""optical biopsy"", can analyse histology and cytology features of a tissue which otherwise is only possible by tissue biopsy.
Similar to confocal microscopy, the laser in CLE filtered by the pinhole excites the fluorescent dye through a beam splitter and objective lens. The fluorescent emission then follows similar paths into the detector. A pinhole is used to select emissions from the desired focal plane. Two categories of CLE exist, namely probe-based (pCLE) and the less common endoscopy-based endoscopy (eCLE).
CLE can be intubated to study the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accessory digestive organs with a fluorescent dye. A variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Barrett's oesophagus, can be diagnosed by the magnified and in-depth view in combination with traditional endoscopy.


== Significance ==
CLE can identify the lesions with a small depths of view under the tissue, in contrast to the surface level in conventional endoscopy. It also allows clinicians to discriminate benign or malignant lesions through real-time histological diagnosis by revealing the properties of the lamina at a cellular level.
An example is Whipple's disease. Conventional endoscopy presents a whitish-patterned duodenal mucosa. CLE, in comparison, generates two images –– the superficial images show capillary leak in duodenal mucosa while the deep images show cells of duodenal mucosa, including goblet cells and foamy macrophages in lamina propria. Compared to histological examination of the same duodenal site after periodic acid-Schiff staining, CLE identifies similar patterns of goblet cells and foamy macrophages.


== Types ==
Two types of CLE have been invented, namely probe-based (pCLE) and endoscope-based CLE (eCLE).


=== Probe-based CLE ===
pCLE, developed by Mauna Kea Technologies, is a fibre bundle transit through the 2.8 mm working channel (the hollow hole) of the standard endoscope into the GI tract. With a fixed plane of imaging, each fibre acts as a pinhole to filter unwanted noise. The frame rate lies between 9 to 12 images/second.


=== Endoscope-based CLE ===
eCLE, developed by Pentax, is a confocal microscopy fixed at the end of the endoscopic tube. The integrated machine of eCLE is larger than the pCLE in diameter, making GI tract endoscopic intubation more difficult. eCLE has ceased commercially due to the camera's inflexibility.


== Medical uses ==


=== Oesophagus ===
CLE is effective in detecting premalignant, including Barrett's oesophagus, and malignant (cancerous) lesions in the upper GI tract. The modifications of mucosa shown in histopathology as an index of malignancy can be identified under CLE, such as high-grade dysplasia. CLE can also be implemented to refer to the treatment of Barrett's oesophagus by measuring the lateral extent of neoplasia.
The Miami classification is the most popular system in oesophageal CLE diagnosis.


=== Stomach and duodenum ===
Similar to that of the oesophagus, CLE is able to detect early gastric cancer, as well as premalignant conditions, such as gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. CLE can detect and distinguish the stomach pit patterns to identify the disease in accordance with the Miami classification, which was refined in 2016 to include both pit patterns and the architecture of blood vessels. The refined classification allows clinicians to differentiate between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions.
The presence of Helicobacter pylori can also be identified using CLE by viewing the morphological changes in tissues.


=== Lower Gastrointestinal Tract ===
CLE reveals ""soccer ball-like pattern"" of narrower capillaries in malignant lymphomas; distorted architecture and fluorescein leakage from lumen in colonic adenocarcinoma; and blunt-shaped villi and crypts and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes in coeliac disease.
CLE can be utilized to identify adenoma and neoplasia in colorectal polyps and lesions. The Miami classification provides guidelines for clinicians to differentiate neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions.


==== Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) ====
CLE can be used for the identification of IBD and its subtypes (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) based on the observation on morphological characteristics, such as architectural distortion, lowered crypt density, crypt irregularity and an abnormally high density of epithelial gaps. The prediction of IBD progression on non-inflamed epithelium is achievable, too, making way for a novel ""treat-to-target"" therapeutic approach.


=== Pancreas ===
Incorporating an EUS, CLE can accurately diagnose pancreatic cystic lesions, including mucinous and non-mucinous lesions. Special needles are used to collect fluid and cyst wall tissues for testing. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can also be viewed by CLE. Observing cystic lesions and PDAC, clinicians can identify early chronic pancreatitis and determine the malignancies of lesions.


=== Biliary duct ===
Biliary stricture can be viewed by CLE. The Miami and Paris classifications can be adapted to differentiate cancerous and inflammatory causes.


=== Others ===
The discrimination of inflammation and malignant tumor in lung and the urinary system may be done by using CLE and this is currently under research. Some usages such as oral and other head-and-neck cancer diagnosis have been proposed.


=== Molecular imaging ===

Antibodies of molecular targets are used to diagnose GI diseases by histology. CLE captures the fluorescence produced by specific antibodies binding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Comparing the significant difference in fluorescent strength, clinicians can differentiate normal and neoplastic tissue. Molecular imaging with antibodies may be applied to CLE as a diagnostic benchmark due to high correlation with ex vivo microscopy.
The molecular imaging technique can be used in a similar manner in the examination of head and neck cancer using CLE, though the diagnostic targets may be different from those in the gastrointestinal tract.


== Mechanism ==


=== Basic mechanism ===
The laser emitted by CLE through a pinhole is reflected by the beam splitter or a dichroic mirror and focused by an objective lens. The fluorescent dye in targeted tissue is excited and emits a specific wavelength. The emission from the focal plane of the tissue then is collected by the objective lens and the beam splitter. The laser is eventually filtered by a pinhole to reduce out-of-focus noise to enter the detector or photomultiplier tube.


==== Topical dyes ====
Cresyl violet and acriflavine can be used as topical dyes. Cresyl violet is a common stain in histology used for light microscopy sections, especially brain sections. In CLE, it can enhance the viewing of the cytoplasm, yet it limits tissue penetration and does not show anything about vasculature. Acriflavine is an antiseptic and dye. In CLE, it can stain the nuclei of GI surface epithelial cells. It is however subjected to cytotoxic and mutagenic properties, in addition to common side effects of irritation.


==== Intravenous dyes ====

Fluorescein is the most popular IV dye for CLE. Fluorescein is an FDA-cleared dye that is used in ophthalmology clinics in routine as it appears green under cobalt blue light. It is commonly applied topically to identify corneal diseases with slit lamp microscopes including corneal abrasion, ulcers, and infections; or intravenously to identify retinal diseases with angiography including macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. In CLE, it is usually administered intravenously immediately before the intubation of an endoscopic tube. The fluorescence is reported to be the most prominent from a few seconds to 8 minutes. Fluorescein is slowly eliminated; thus the fluorescence slowly decays up to a minimal detectable level after 1 hour, giving a time window for clinicians to investigate.


=== Recognition and optical flow algorithm ===
CLE's narrow field of vision makes it difficult for clinicians to identify the location and path of the probe, making it challenging to correspond the image obtained and the lesion location and direction. Research has proposed a crypt recognition algorithm, which predicts the pixel displacement by the moving angle and distance. By restoring the exploration path of CLE, clinicians can locate the sites of interest and improve diagnostic efficiency.


=== Image quality assessment ===
Research has proposed a new assessment method for filtering images yielded from CLE. As CLE often encounters image distortions, the degradation of image quality and loss of image information, eventually increase the difficulty of accurate diagnosis. A new image quality assessment (IQA) utilising Weber's Law and local descriptors assesses the quality and filters images with low diagnostic value.


== Limitations ==

The variety of pathology conditions identifiable by CLE is limited. The histological diagnosis is limited to cancerous lesions and inflammation where the number of specific diseases identifiable is not numerous. Moreover, it requires specific training to operate CLE and correctly interpret CLE images, which are rarely used skills by experts in endoscopy. Owing to the narrow field of view, the applications of CLE might be restricted. Computer-aided diagnosis with AI technology may be beneficial in diagnosing CLE images.
Fluorescein is the only safe dye approved while cresyl violet and acriflavine are commonly used agents. The lack of choice of contrast agents may limit the application of CLE. For instance, patients allergic to fluorescein should never undergo CLE that involves the use of this intravenous dye.
The optical system consists of complex microscopic optical instruments, which are difficult to manufacture and assemble. Therefore, the tool is expensive.
CLE is mostly used in combination with other techniques instead of replacing conventional endoscopy with biopsy. CLE can only serve as a complementary to the traditional biopsy. By sharing the same working channel, conventional biopsy and CLE can be done alternatively by single intubation.


== Adverse effects ==

The allergic properties of fluorescein, the common intravenous fluorescent dye for CLE, is the major culprit for the mild adverse events.


=== Intubation ===
CLE, similar to other diagnostic endoscopic techniques, may give rise to pancreatitis when used to examine the pancreas. The likelihood for pancreatitis is especially high in needle-based CLE. The incidence can be minimized by shortening the inspection time and avoiding excessive needle movement within the pancreatic cyst wall.


=== Fluorescein ===

Mild side effects, which are rare, include

Nausea
Vomiting with mild epigastric pain
Rash at injection site
Transient hypotension without shock
Diffuse erythema
These effects are manageable unless patients have prior experiences of them.
Cases of anaphylaxis are reported by ophthalmological uses of fluorescein. Prophylactic use of antihistamines can reduce the chances of allergic reactions or skin prick tests can identify the risk of allergic reactions.


=== Acriflavine ===
Acriflavine, another contrast agent for CLE, is potentially carcinogenic to humans due to its known mutagenic ability. The dye is therefore not approved by the FDA.


== History ==
CLE is a modern, in vivo adaptation of confocal microscopy, the microscopic technique invented by Marvin Minsky in 1957.
Since 2004, CLE has been used for observing histopathological changes in gastrointestinal tissues.

Art,"Art is a diverse range of human activity and its resulting product that involves creative or imaginative talent, generally expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.
There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of ""the arts"". Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.
The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.


== Overview ==
In the perspective of the history of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of ""artistic works"" does not fit well outside modern Western societies. One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to ""skill"" or ""craft"", as associated with words such as ""artisan"". English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology.

Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art. Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art, while Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.
With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.
The more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century. Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer works of art.
Within this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.
The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as ""one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture"". Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle. Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator. The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Kant, and was developed in the early 20th century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as ""the art world"" has conferred ""the status of candidate for appreciation"". Larry Shiner has described fine art as ""not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.""
Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as ""a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science"".


== History ==

A shell engraved by Homo erectus was determined to be between 430,000 and 540,000 years old. A set of eight 130,000 years old white-tailed eagle talons bear cut marks and abrasion that indicate manipulation by neanderthals, possibly for using it as jewelry. A series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave. Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years.
The oldest piece of art found in Europe is the Riesenhirschknochen der Einhornhöhle, dating back 51,000 years and made by Neanderthals.
Sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them.
The first undisputed sculptures and similar art pieces, like the Venus of Hohle Fels, are the numerous objects found at the Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura UNESCO World Heritage Site, where the oldest non-stationary works of human art yet discovered were found, in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines, in addition to the oldest musical instruments unearthed so far, with the artifacts dating between 43,000 and 35,000 BC, so being the first centre of human art.

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.
In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.
Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.

In the east, Islamic art's rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architecture. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning terracotta army of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, Tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but Ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century.

The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as Blake's portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or David's propagandistic paintings. This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of Goethe. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as academic art, Symbolism, impressionism and fauvism among others.
The history of 20th-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence.
Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. Theodor W. Adorno said in 1970, ""It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."" Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.
In The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher and seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which ""that which is"" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.
Historically, art and artistic skills and ideas have often been spread through trade. An example of this is the Silk Road, where Hellenistic, Iranian, Indian and Chinese influences could mix. Greco Buddhist art is one of the most vivid examples of this interaction. The meeting of different cultures and worldviews also influenced artistic creation. An example of this is the multicultural port metropolis of Trieste at the beginning of the 20th century, where James Joyce met writers from Central Europe and the artistic development of New York City as a cultural melting pot.


== Forms, genres, media, and styles ==

The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media, genre, styles, and form. Art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., figurae), such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value. Form may also include Design principles, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm.
In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context. Extreme Formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content—i.e., denotations and connotations—while others prefer terms like meaning and significance.
Extreme Intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded. It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented, and the content as the artist's experience of that subject. For example, the composition of Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne is partly borrowed from the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. As evidenced by the title, the subject is Napoleon, and the content is Ingres's representation of Napoleon as ""Emperor-God beyond time and space"". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is ""socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise"".
Finally, the developing theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. Art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art.


=== Skill and craft ===

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium. Art can also refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.
There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the epithet art, particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. Rembrandt's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.

A common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp's Fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects (""ready-made"") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. Tracey Emin's My Bed, or Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living follow this example. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands-on works of art.


== Purpose ==

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of art is ""vague"", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).


=== Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.

Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm. Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. – Aristotle
Experience of the mysterious. Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein
Expression of the imagination. Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. – Immanuel Kant
Ritualistic and symbolic functions. In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. – Silva Tomaskova


=== Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or used as a form of communication.

Communication. Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen
Art as entertainment. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of motion pictures and video games.
The Avant-Garde. Art for political change. One of the defining functions of early 20th-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as the avant-garde arts.By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)
Art as a ""free zone"", removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the avant-garde movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, contemporary art has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction, etc.), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.
Art for social inquiry, subversion or anarchy. While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be used to criticize some aspect of society. Graffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray-painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
Art for social causes. Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism, cancer, human trafficking, and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation, human rights in Darfur, murdered and missing Aboriginal women, elder abuse, and pollution. Trashion, using trash to make fashion, practiced by artists such as Marina DeBris is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution.
Art for psychological and healing purposes. Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy. The Diagnostic Drawing Series, for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.
Art for propaganda, or commercialism. Art is often used as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.
Art as a fitness indicator. It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the peacock's tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also Fisherian runaway and handicap principle). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because it attracted mates.
The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.


== Steps ==
Art can be divided into any number of steps one can make an argument for. This section divides the creative process into broad three steps, but there is no consensus on an exact number.


=== Preparation ===

In the first step, the artist envisions the art in their mind. By imagining what their art would look like, the artist begins the process of bringing the art into existence. Preparation of art may involve approaching and researching the subject matter. Artistic inspiration is one of the main drivers of art, and may be considered to stem from instinct, impressions, and feelings.


=== Creation ===

In the second step, the artist executes the creation of their work. The creation of a piece can be affected by factors such as the artist's mood, surroundings, and mental state. For example, The Black Paintings by Francisco de Goya, created in the elder years of his life, are thought to be so bleak because he was in isolation and because of his experience with war. He painted them directly on the walls of his apartment in Spain, and most likely never discussed them with anyone. The Beatles stated drugs such as LSD and cannabis influenced some of their greatest hits, such as Revolver. Trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process.


=== Appreciation ===
The last step is art appreciation, which has the sub-topic of critique. In one study, over half of visual arts students agreed that reflection is an essential step of the art process. According to education journals, the reflection of art is considered an essential part of the experience. However an important aspect of art is that others may view and appreciate it as well. While many focus on whether those viewing/listening/etc. believe the art to be good/successful or not, art has profound value beyond its commercial success as a provider of information and health in society. Art enjoyment can bring about a wide spectrum of emotion due to beauty. Some art is meant to be practical, with its analysis studious, meant to stimulate discourse.


== Public access ==

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.
Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite, though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as moulds made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality Ancient Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines to a very wide market. Cylinder seals were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the Ancient Near East. Once coins were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.
Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when printmaking began with small woodcuts, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations. Popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.

In 1661, the city of Basel, in Switzerland, opened the first public museum of art in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel. Today, its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span, from the early 15th",1
Modal collapse,"In modal logic, modal collapse is the condition in which every true statement is necessarily true, and vice versa; that is to say, there are no contingent truths, or to put it another way, that ""everything exists necessarily"" (and likewise if something does not exist, it cannot exist). In the notation of modal logic, this can be written as 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        ↔
        ◻
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi \leftrightarrow \Box \phi }
  
.
In the context of philosophy, the term is commonly used in critiques of ontological arguments for the existence of God and the principle of divine simplicity. For example, Gödel's ontological proof contains 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        →
        ◻
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi \rightarrow \Box \phi }
  
 as a theorem, which combined with the axioms of system S5 leads to modal collapse.  Since some regard divine freedom as essential to the nature of God, and modal collapse as negating the concept of free will, this then leads to the breakdown of Gödel's argument.

Astrotheology,"Astrotheology is a discipline combining the methods and domains of space science with systematic theology. Astrotheology concerns the theological, cultural, and ethical implications of space exploration and identifies the elements of myth and religion in space science. Astrotheology is a ""multi-disciplinary branch of theology that takes up the relationship between God and the creation, especially the creation of the universe over time."" Ted F. Peters envisions astrotheology as ""the meeting point between theologians and astrobiologists."" A.C. Pieterse describes the field as a ""prophetic wormhole that relates space-time to eschatological transformation"", a theology of nature rather than a natural theology.


== History ==
A.. C. Pieterse traces the ""seeds"" of astrotheology to the works of Greek philosophers such as Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius who ""held that [the] cosmos is infinitely large, with an infinite number of patterns that could sustain intelligence."" The theologian Ted Peters similarly identifies ancient debates on the plurality of worlds (aperoi kosmoi) as a starting point for astrotheology, tracing it from Aristotle through to Thomas Aquinas, Jean Buridan, and William of Ockham.
The word astrotheology, hyphenated as astro-theology, first appears in a tract by the Anglican clergyman William Derham. For Derham, the task of this discipline was to ""glorify God by stressing the immensity and magnificence of God's creation."" Derham advocated a chronology of space science broken into three eras, the Ptolemaic, the Copernican, and post-Copernican. In 1855, Edward Higginson published a series of four lectures, separating astrotheology into an earlier Jewish period and a modern period, the former regarding the mythology of ancient Israelites and the latter encompassing ""modern philosophical views of the solar system and the fixed stars.""


== Relationship to other fields ==
For Peters, astrotheology is ""at minimum, a theology of space science"". It connects with astrobiology, challenging the concept of extraterrestrial intelligence and engaging in discussions about the extent of God's creation. Astrotheology explores the spiritual dimensions inspired by space sciences, and uncovers hidden religious meanings in secular experiences. Astrotheology collaborates with astroethicists to propose public policies related to scientific space exploration and ethical considerations. These policies may include guidelines for responsible space exploration, regulations for the protection of celestial bodies and ecosystems, protocols for interactions with potential extraterrestrial life, and frameworks for international cooperation in space exploration efforts.

Day's End (David Hammons),"Day's End is a 2021 permanent public art project designed by the American artist David Hammons. Originally commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art, the work consists of an architectural outline of a pier made of stainless steel tubes and precast concrete and installed on the Hudson River Park along the southern edge of Gansevoort Peninsula.


== History ==
The work was inspired by the 1975 intervention installation work titled Days End, Conical Intersect by the American 20th-century artist Gordon Matta-Clark. In the original installation, Matta-Clark created five large incisions into the Pier 52 shed, which had formerly occupied the site and measured 373 feet in length and 50 feet in height. The purpose of Matta-Clark's work was to ""let in light that would change during days and seasons"", which he saw as “a peaceful enclosure”. The artist also described it as a ""renovation"" of a ""decaying sad reminder of a previous industrial era"".
The contemporary work by Hammons was announced by the Whitney Museum in 2017 and completed in 2021. It is made of stainless steel tubes and precast concrete and consists of an open structure that adheres to the dimensions, proportions, and placement of the previous shed. The director of the Whitney Adam D. Weinberg called the installation a ""hybrid"" which incorporated ""architecture, sculpture, drawing, site-specific project, land art, appropriated object, and none of the above"".


== Reception ==
Upon its unveiling in 2021, Critic Holland Cotter of The New York Times called the work ""an immortalizing homage to Gordon Matta-Clark and art history"" and suggested that it was ""roomy enough to accommodate all the brilliant fragments of an incomparable career"". At the same time, Kathleen Langjahr, writing for The Architect's Newspaper, said that Day's End failed to ""live up to the impossible hopes of a previous generation"". She also remained skeptical of the public character of the artwork saying that the installation, similarly to the neighboring Little Island at Pier 55, was ""pitched as a 'gift' from the city’s wealthiest, for which we are expected to be grateful"". In a review for Artforum, Peter L'Official recalled the rich queer history of Pier 52, once a prominent cruising site for gay men in the 1970s. He drew attention to the compelling connection between this storied location and Alvin Baltrop's evocative photographs, which capture the homosexual encounters of that era.

Vicarious Hypothesis,"The Vicarious Hypothesis, or hypothesis vicaria, was a planetary hypothesis proposed by Johannes Kepler to describe the motion of Mars. The hypothesis adopted the circular orbit and equant of Ptolemy's planetary model as well as the heliocentrism of the Copernican model. Calculations using the Vicarious Hypothesis did not support a circular orbit for Mars, leading Kepler to propose elliptical orbits as one of three laws of planetary motion in Astronomia Nova.


== History ==
In 1600, Johannes Kepler met and began working with Tycho Brahe at Benátky, a town north of Prague where Brahe's new observatory was being built. Brahe assigned Kepler the task of modeling the motion of Mars using only data that Brahe had collected himself. Upon the death of Brahe in 1601, all of Brahe's data was willed to Kepler. Brahe's observational data was among the most accurate of his time, which Kepler used in the construction of the Vicarious Hypothesis.


=== Predecessors ===


==== Ptolemy ====

Claudius Ptolemy's planetary model consisted of a stationary earth surrounded by fixed circles, called deferents, which carried smaller, rotating circles called epicycles. Planets rotated on the epicycles as the epicycles traveled along the deferent. Ptolemy shifted the Earth away from the center of the deferent and introduced another point, the equant, equidistant to the deferent's center on the opposite side of the Earth.
The Vicarious Hypothesis uses a circular orbit for Mars and reintroduces a form of the equant to describe the motion of Mars with constant angular speed.


==== Copernicus ====
Nicolaus Copernicus broke from the geocentric model of Ptolemy by placing the Sun at the center of his planetary model. However, Copernicus retained circular orbits for the planets and added an orbit for the Earth, insisting that the Earth revolved around the Sun. The Sun was positioned off-center of the orbits but was still contained within all orbits.
Kepler adopted Copernican heliocentrism in the construction of the Vicarious Hypothesis so that his measurements of the distances to Mars were taken relative to the Sun.


== Development ==
Kepler's construction of the Vicarious Hypothesis was based on a circular orbit for Mars and a heliocentric model for the planets.  After receiving longitudinal observation data from Tycho Brahe, Kepler had twelve observations, two being his own, in which Mars was at opposition to the Sun. From these twelve observations, Kepler chose four to form the basis of the Vicarious Hypothesis because they had a relatively uniform distribution across his proposed circular orbit for Mars. In this sense, the Vicarious Hypothesis functions as a fit to observational data. Kepler used these four observations to determine the eccentricities of the Sun and equant of his proposed orbit. Unlike the Ptolemaic System, in which the Earth and equant were assumed equidistant to the center of the orbit, the Vicarious Hypothesis placed the equant where the time and location of the observation would match.
Using the Vicarious Hypothesis, Kepler determined the eccentricities of the Sun and equant to be 11,332 and 7,232 arbitrary units, respectively, for the Martian orbital radius of 100,000 units. Using these positions for the Sun and equant, the model constructed using the Vicarious Hypothesis agreed with the twelve observations within 2' of arc, a level of accuracy better than any other previous model. While the heliocentric longitudes of this model proved to be accurate, distances from the Sun to Mars, or latitudes of Mars, challenged the model. In his book, Astronomia Nova, Kepler determined that the eccentricity of the Sun, based on latitudinal oppositions, should be between a range of 8,000 and 9,943, conflicting with the eccentricity of 11,332 determined by the Vicarious Hypothesis. To accommodate the latitudinal data, Kepler modified the Vicarious Hypothesis to include a bisected eccentricity, making the Sun and equant equidistant to the center of the orbit. This resolved the error in the latitudes of Mars but introduced a longitudinal error of 8' of arc in some parts of the Mars orbit. While an 8' error still had better accuracy than previous models, corresponding to approximately one-fourth the diameter of the Moon, Kepler rejected the Vicarious Hypothesis because he did not believe it was accurate enough to model the true orbit of Mars.


== Historical significance ==
The errors in latitude and longitude of the Mars orbit made Kepler realize that false assumptions were made using the Vicarious Hypothesis. In particular, Kepler amended the hypothesis to exclude the circular orbit. Kepler realized that he could fix the error by reducing the spread of the central region of the circular orbit, creating an ellipse. He used calculations previously made with the Vicarious Hypothesis to confirm the elliptical orbit for Mars. Kepler published his results in Astronomia Nova, in which he introduces the elliptical orbit for planets as his first law of planetary motion.

First point of Aries,"The first point of Aries, also known as the cusp of Aries, is the location of the March equinox (the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere, and the autumnal equinox in the southern), used as a reference point in celestial coordinate systems. In diagrams using such coordinate systems, it is often indicated with the symbol ♈︎. Named for the constellation of Aries, it is one of the two points on the celestial sphere at which the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic, the other being the first point of Libra, located exactly 180° from it. Due to precession of the equinoxes since the positions were originally named in antiquity, the position of the Sun when at the March equinox is now in Pisces; when it is at the September equinox, it is in Virgo (as of J2000).
Along its yearly path through the zodiac, the Sun meets the celestial equator as it travels from south to north at the first point of Aries, and from north to south at the first point of Libra. The first point of Aries is considered to be the celestial ""prime meridian"" from which right ascension is calculated.


== History ==

The choice of starting position from which to measure the Sun's motion across the celestial sphere is arbitrary. The equinoxes are preferred as an equinox marks the point in time when the Sun has neither northern nor southern declination but is crossing the celestial equator. Of the two possible equinoxes the ancient Greeks chose the March equinox as the starting point.  This coincided with the festival of Hilaria, a time of optimism and beginnings where farmers began to sow or observed the first growth and blossoming of trees and summer crops.  The naming of Aries is late in the Babylonian zodiac where the equinox was in its earliest tradition marked as in the early Middle Bronze Age by actual coincidence with the Pleiades. The time also corresponds to the time of castration of male calves, mules and donkeys, Sanguia on the vernal equinox and marked the start of spring proper.
The first point of Aries is so called because, when Hipparchus defined it in 130 BCE, it was located in the western extreme of the constellation of Aries, near its border with Pisces and the star γ Arietis. Due to the Sun's eastward movement across the sky throughout the year, this western end of Aries was the point at which the Sun entered the constellation, hence the name first point of Aries.


== Definition ==
Due to Earth's axial precession, this point gradually moves westwards at a rate of about one degree every 72 years. This means that, since the time of Hipparchus, it has shifted across the sky by about 30°, and is currently located within Pisces, near its border with Aquarius. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April until mid-May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of the northern spring.
The first point of Aries is important to the fields of astronomy, nautical navigation and astrology. Navigational ephemeris tables record the geographic position of the first point of Aries as the reference for position of navigational stars. Due to the slow precession of the equinoxes, the zenith view (above a location) of constellations at a time of year from a given location have slowly moved west (by using solar epochs the drift is known). The tropical Zodiac is similarly affected and no longer corresponds with the constellations (the Cusp of Libra today is located within Virgo). In sidereal astrology, by contrast, the first point of Aries remains aligned with the Aries constellation.

Fire triangle,"The fire triangle or combustion triangle is a simple model for understanding the necessary ingredients for most fires.
The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (usually oxygen). A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture. A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle. For example, covering a fire with a fire blanket blocks oxygen and can extinguish a fire. In large fires where firefighters are called in, decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area.


== Fire tetrahedron ==

The fire tetrahedron represents the addition of the chemical chain reaction, to the three already present in the fire triangle. 
Combustion is a chemical reaction that feeds a fire more heat and allows it to continue. Once a fire has started, the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements of the fire is blocked:

foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen it needs
water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the ignition point, or to remove or disperse the fuel.
halon can be used to remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the chemical reaction responsible for the fire.
When the fire involves burning metals like lithium, magnesium, titanium, etc. (known as a class-D fire), it becomes even more important to consider the energy release. Because the metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is released, putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even exploding. Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as titanium. Therefore, inert agents (e.g. dry sand) must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion.
In the same way, as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is (entirely) removed, combustion stops.


== Oxidizer ==
The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction. In most cases, it is the ambient air, and in particular one of its components, oxygen (O2). By depriving a fire of air the fire can be extinguished, such as when covering the flame of a small candle with an empty glass. To the contrary, if air is blown over a wood fire (as with bellows), the fire is activated by the introduction of more air.
Some chemicals, such as fluorine gas, perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate, or chlorine trifluoride, act as oxidizers, sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself.  A fire based on a reaction with these oxidizers can be very difficult to put out until the oxidizer is exhausted; that leg of the fire triangle cannot be broken by normal means (i.e., depriving it of air will not smother it).
In certain cases such as some explosives, the oxidizer and combustible are the same (e.g., nitroglycerin, an unstable molecule that has oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts).
The reaction is initiated by an activating energy — in most cases, it is heat. Several examples include friction, as in the case of matches, heating an electrical wire, a flame (propagation of fire), or a spark (from a lighter or from any starting electrical device). There are also many other ways to bring sufficient activation energy including electricity, radiation, and pressure, all of which will lead to a temperature rise. In most cases, heat production enables self-sustainability of the reaction, and enables a chain reaction to grow. The temperature at which a liquid produces sufficient vapor to get a flammable mix with self-sustainable combustion is called its flash-point.


== Extinguishment of the fire ==
To stop a combustion reaction, one of the three elements of the fire triangle must be removed.
Without sufficient heat, a fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue.  Heat can be removed by the application of a substance which reduces the amount of heat available to the fire reaction. This is often water, which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam.  Introducing sufficient quantities and types of powder or gas in the flame reduces the amount of heat available for the fire reaction in the same manner.  Scraping embers from a burning structure also removes the heat source.  Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the ignition source.
Without fuel, a fire will stop.  Fuel can be removed naturally, as where the fire has consumed all the burnable fuel, or manually, by mechanically or chemically removing the fuel from the fire.  Fuel separation is an important factor in wildland fire suppression, and is the basis for most major tactics, such as controlled burns.  The fire stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease in energy release and a lower temperature. Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat.
Without sufficient oxygen, a fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue.  With a decreased oxygen concentration, the combustion process slows. Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, a fire blanket or water.


== Role of water in firefighting ==
The water can have two different roles. In the case of a solid combustible, the solid fuel produces pyrolyzing products under the influence of heat, commonly radiation. This process is halted by the application of water, since water is more easily evaporated than the fuel is pyrolyzed. Thereby energy is removed from the fuel surface and it is cooled and the pyrolysis is stopped, removing the fuel supply to the flames. In fire fighting, this is referred to as surface cooling.
In the gas phase, i.e. in the flames or in the smoke, the combustible can not be separated from the oxidizer, and the only possible action consists of cooling down. In this case, water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase, thereby lowering the temperature and adding water vapour making the gas mixture non combustible. This requires droplets of a size less than about 0.2 mm. In fire fighting, this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling.
Cases also exist  where the ignition factor is not the activation energy. For example, a smoke explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by a sudden fresh air input (oxidizer input). The interval in which an air/gas mix can burn is limited by the explosive limits of the air. This interval can be very small (kerosene) or large (acetylene).
Water cannot be used on certain type of fires:

Fires where live electricity is present – as water conducts electricity it presents an electrocution hazard.
Hydrocarbon fires – as it will only spread the fire because of the difference in density/hydrophobicity. For example, adding water to a fire with an oil source will cause the oil to spread, since oil and water do not mix. However, using a foam/water mix in a specific application method is acceptable.
Metal fires – as these fires produce huge amounts of energy (up to 7.550 calories/kg for aluminium) and water can also create violent chemical reactions with burning metal (possibly even serving as an additional oxidizing agent).
Since these reactions are well understood, it has been possible to create specific water-additives which will allow:

A better heat absorption with a higher density than water.
Carrying free radical catchers on the fire.
Carrying foaming agents to enable water to stay on the surface of a liquid fire and prevent gas release.
Carrying specific reactives which will react and change the nature of the burning material.
Water-additives are generally designed to be effective on several categories of fires (class A + class B or even class A + class B + class F [Class K in North America]), meaning a better global performance and usability of a single extinguisher on many different types of fires (or fires that involve several different classes of materials).


== Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires ==

In the context of wildland fire, the fire triangle can be scaled up to apply to fire spread over landscapes (scales of days and several kilometres) and recurrence of fire over time (scales of decades and hundreds of kilometres). Thus, while heat is important to ignite a flame, topography is important for aiding fire spread especially by preheating upslope fuels, and ignitions sources are important to help explain recurrence on longer time scales. Similarly, while oxygen is relevant to sustain a flame, weather and associated winds feed oxygen into a spreading fire, and the longer-term pattern of weather is summarized as climate. Lastly, fuels is the term to describe what burns in a single flame to the range of materials burnt in a spreading wildfire, but fuels vary over larger space and time scales in what is called vegetation.
At the smallest scale, the combustion fire triangle, individual fuel particles are ignited once at a critical temperature, and fire transfers energy to the nearest surroundings. Combustion events range on the scale of several seconds to a couple of days and their effects are monitored at the quadrant scale. The largest scale, in contrast, describes the fire regime concept. Global climate change drives many of the factors involved in the 'wildfire' and the 'fire regime' triangles.  For example, with respect to the fire regime, a particular vegetation type will support a characteristic fire in terms of recurrence, intensity, seasonality and biological effects; a change in vegetation type will have implications for a changing fire regime.

Tourist sign,"A tourist sign, often referred to as a brown sign, is a traffic sign whose purpose is to direct visitors to tourist destinations, such as historic buildings, tourist regions, caravan or camp sites, picnic areas, sporting facilities or museums. By international convention brown signs with white lettering and white pictograms are often used for this purpose.
In the mid-1970s tourist signs were introduced in France. Since that time the idea of directing tourists to sights and attractions using a uniform type of signage has spread around the world. In Germany these tourist signs were first used in 1984. It is not clear which of the two signs, to the Löwensteiner Berge or to Burg Teck, was first erected there.


== Usage ==
Tourist signs have three main applications:

as information signs and signposts that point to important tourist destinations or places of interest in a specific area, such as within a village or a town;
as standard signs used to mark tourist or holiday routes with special themes; or
to herald the presence of nearby landscapes, towns and regions, usually on long-distance routes such as motorways.


== Design ==

In many countries the design and use of tourist signs is laid down in order to ensure a uniform appearance. In addition to their typically brown and white colours, they use sans serif fonts that are easy to read. In order to improve their usefulness for tourists dual languages may be used. The pictograms employed are designed to be simple and meaningful, and are not multi-coloured.


== Criticism and reception ==
Critics complain that tourists signs contain too much information and distract motorists from concentrating on the road. The number of tourist signs continues to grow and less significant destinations are increasingly being signed. A study carried out at Harz University of Applied Sciences in 2019 found that one in six motorists on German freeways had already spontaneously visited a destination advertised on a tourist information board. Around two thirds could also recall specific contents of individual information boards.

Stellar birthline,"The stellar birthline is a line in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram that relates the effective temperature and luminosity of pre-main-sequence stars on the start of their contraction. To this point, the objects are protostars, and are so deeply in the cloud of dust and gas from which they are forming that they radiate only in far infrared and millimeter wavelengths. 

When stellar winds disperse this cloud, the star becomes visible as pre-main-sequence object. The set of locations on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram where these newly visible stars form is called the birthline and is found above the main sequence.


== Location ==
Location of the stellar birthline depends on detail in the accretion rate onto the star and geometry of this accretion, i.e. whether or not it is happening through an accretion disk. This means that the birthline is not an infinitely thin curve, but has a finite thickness on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

Cash,"In economics, cash is money in the physical form of currency, such as banknotes and coins.
In bookkeeping and financial accounting, cash is current assets comprising currency or currency equivalents that can be accessed immediately or near-immediately (as in the case of money market accounts). Cash is seen either as a reserve for payments, in case of a structural or incidental negative cash flow or as a way to avoid a downturn on financial markets.


== Etymology ==
The English word cash originally meant 'money box', and later came to have a secondary meaning 'money'. This secondary usage became the sole meaning in the 18th century. The word cash comes from the Middle French caisse 'money box', which comes from the Old Italian cassa, and ultimately from the Latin capsa 'box'.


== History ==

In Western Europe, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, coins, silver jewelry and hacksilver (silver objects hacked into pieces) were for centuries the only form of money, until Venetian merchants started using silver bars for large transactions in the early Middle Ages. In a separate development, Venetian merchants started using paper bills, instructing their banker to make payments. Similar marked silver bars were in use in lands where the Venetian merchants had established representative offices. The Byzantine Empire and several states in the Balkan area and Kievan Rus also used marked silver bars for large payments. As the world economy developed and silver supplies increased, in particular after the colonization of South America, coins became larger and a standard coin for international payment developed from the 15th century: the Spanish and Spanish colonial coin of 8 reales. Its counterpart in gold was the Venetian ducat.
Coin types would compete for markets. By conquering foreign markets, the issuing rulers would enjoy extra income from seigniorage (the difference between the value of the coin and the value of the metal the coin was made of). Successful coin types of high nobility would be copied by lower nobility for seigniorage. Imitations were usually of a lower weight, undermining the popularity of the original. As feudal states coalesced into kingdoms, imitation of silver types abated, but gold coins, in particular, the gold ducat and the gold florin were still issued as trade coins: coins without a fixed value, going by weight. Colonial powers also sought to take away market share from Spain by issuing trade coin equivalents of silver Spanish coins, without much success.
In the early part of the 17th century, English East India Company coins were minted in England and shipped to the East. In England, over time the word cash was adopted from Sanskrit कर्ष karsa, a weight of gold or silver but akin to the Old Persian 𐎣𐎼𐏁 karsha, unit of weight (83.30 grams). East India Company coinage had both Urdu and English writing on it, to facilitate its use within the trade. In 1671, the directors of the East India Company ordered a mint to be established at Bombay, known as Bombaim. In 1677 this was sanctioned by the Crown, the coins, having received royal sanction, were struck as silver rupees; the inscription runs ""The rupee of Bombaim"", by the authority of Charles II.
Around that time, coins were also being produced for the East India Company at the Madras mint. The Tamil the word for money is kaasu, which may  have been modified into 'cash'.  Both words, 'kaasu' and 'cash', have the same meaning, unlike money box. The currency at the company's Bombay and Bengal administrative regions was the rupee. At Madras, however, the company's accounts were reckoned in pagodas, fractions, fanams, faluce and cash. This system was maintained until 1818 when the rupee was adopted as the unit of currency for the company's operations.

Paper money was first used in China during the Tang dynasty 500 years prior to it catching on in Europe. During his visit to China in the 13th century, Marco Polo was amazed to find that people traded paper money for goods rather than valuable coins made of silver or gold. He wrote extensively about how the Great Kaan used a part of the Mulberry Tree to create the paper money as well as the process with which a seal was used to impress on the paper to authenticate it. Marco Polo also talks about the chance of forgery and states that someone caught forging money would be punished with death. In the 17th century, European countries started to use paper money in part due to a shortage of precious metals, leading to fewer coins being produced and put into circulation. At first, it was most popular in the colonies of European powers. In the 18th century, important paper issues were made in colonies such as Ceylon and the bordering colonies of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice. John Law did pioneering work on banknotes with the Banque Royale. The relation between money supply and inflation was still imperfectly understood and the bank went under rendering its notes worthless, because they had been over-issued. The lessons learned were applied to the Bank of England, which played a crucial role in financing the Peninsular War against French troops, hamstrung by a metallic Franc de Germinal.
The ability to create paper money made nation-states responsible for the management of inflation, through control of the money supply. It also made a direct relation between the metal of the coin and its denomination superfluous. From 1816, coins generally became token money, though some large silver and gold coins remained standard coins until 1927. The World War I saw standard coins disappear to a very large extent. Afterward, standard gold coins, mainly British sovereigns, would still be used in colonies and less developed economies and silver Maria Theresa thalers dated 1780 would be struck as trade coins for countries in East Asia until 1946 and possibly later locally.
Cash has now become a very small part of the money supply. Its remaining role is to provide a form of currency storage and payment for those who do not wish to take part in other systems, and make small payments conveniently and promptly, though this latter role is being replaced more and more frequently by electronic payment systems. Research has found that the demand for cash decreases as debit card usage increases because merchants need to make less change for customer purchases.
Cash is increasing in circulation. The amount of the United States dollar in circulation increased by 42% from 2007 to 2012. The amount of pound sterling banknotes in circulation increased by 29% from 2008 to 2013. The amount of euro in circulation increased by 34% from August 2008 to August 2013 (2% of the increase was due to the adoption of euro in Slovakia 2009 and in Estonia 2011).


== Motives of cash holding ==
In economic theory (according Keynesian economics), the cash holding of cash (especially sight deposits) is roughly attributed to three motives:

Transactions motive
Precautionary motive
Speculative motive.
The transactions motive covers the business needs of economic subjects, the precautionary motive serves to hold money for liquidity purposes and to provide for crisis situations, and the speculation motive, according to John Maynard Keynes, results from the uncertainty about future interest rate developments and relates to financial investments.
In addition to this purely economic importance, there are other aspects of cash use:

Anonymous payment without disclosing personal data
Trust to the central bank (control and publication of money creation)
Activation of a reward center in the brain (anticipation of reaching a specific goal)
Expenditure control (immediate physical payment)
Tradition (haptic experience, e.g. monetary donation; long-term reliability of value retention)
Inclusion (equal participation in economic life for all)
Identification (symbolic character, solidarity and group membership)
Educational tool for children (objective handling of assets and expenses)
Paying a tip as immediate recognition of good service.
In practice, there may be a combination of such motives, with the precautionary motive of preserving value and anonymous payment being decisive. Due to its unique characteristics, there is no perfect substitute for cash. Demonetisation or capital control can destabilize the economy if electronic means of payment are not readily available (e.g. 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation).


== Cash in circulation ==
Cash in circulation is characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations. Wage and salary payment dates, tax payment dates or holidays lead to statistically perceptible increases in cash in circulation, for which the credit institutions are preparing. Since cash holdings at banks do not earn interest and can also lead to security problems (bank robbery), banks usually only hold very small amounts of cash. They are therefore forced to involve the central bank in times of higher cash requirements. Therefore, the cash in circulation only remains unchanged if the banks hand over cash from their own cash holdings to their bank customers or take cash deposits from their customers into their own holdings.
The ratio of the cash in circulation in relation to the gross domestic product (cash to GDP ratio) is a good indicator of cash usage and payment behavior in an economy. In countries like the United States, increased use of debit and credit cards is increasing the amount of cash in circulation at a slower rate than in countries with a high amount of cash payments. In 2018, it ranged from 1.3% (in Sweden) to more than 21% (in Japan), 10.5% in Switzerland and 10.7% in the eurozone. 
Since around 2018, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, cash in circulation in the eurozone has increased significantly while the share of cash payments (i.e. transactions) has decreased, known as the paradox of banknotes. Analyzes show that private households are increasingly keeping cash as a precaution against crises and that negative interest rates also play a role. This effect is also observed in many other currency areas, e.g. in the United States and Japan.


== Banknote tracking ==
Theoretically, it is possible to track cash usage by capturing the unique serial numbers on the banknotes during transactions. To do this, the serial numbers would have to be recorded personally for all withdrawals from automated teller machines (ATM) and for each payment transaction at a retail checkout, including change. In practice, such comprehensive tracking requires a high level of technical effort and generates immense amounts of data. It would combine the disadvantages of payment methods, the somewhat cumbersome nature of cash from the offline world and the lack of anonymity of electronic money from the online world. In addition, in most countries, personal tracking of payment transactions is not permitted for the reasons of information privacy.
There are the following exceptions in cash applications:

Registration of ransom money for blackmail (e.g. for the Oetker kidnapping)
Macroeconomic studies of cash flows through the central bank
Statistical recording of the lifespan of banknotes by the central bank
Tracking the (location-based) migration of individual banknotes using EuroBillTracker for euro banknotes, Where's George? for US dollars and Where's Willy? for Canadian dollars as a hobby
Use of individual banknotes for sharing messages with recipients using the mobile app smill.
Since 2016, the People's Bank of China has requested the recording of banknotes issued and deposited at ATMs and bank counters, arguing that counterfeit money will be prosecuted. However, the serial number is not a reliable indicator, because counterfeit banknotes mostly use serial numbers from real banknotes in circulation. In addition, damaged or scribbled banknotes may cause reading errors. With Directive ECB/2010/14, the European Central Bank (ECB) therefore requires to check the authenticity of deposited and withdrawn banknotes at bank counters and ATMs using tested devices and to trace the origin of suspected counterfeit banknotes to the account holder and physically seize it.


== Competition of cash ==


=== Cashless payments ===

 
Cashless society can be defined as one in which all financial transactions are handled through ""digital"" forms (debit and credit cards) in preference to cash (physical banknotes and coins). Cashless societies have been a part of history from the very beginning of human existence. Barter and other methods of exchange were used to conduct a wide variety of trade transactions during this time period.
Since the 1980s, the use of banknotes has increasingly been displaced by credit and debit cards, electronic money transfers and mobile payments, but much slower than expected. The cashless society has been predicted for more than forty years, but cash remains the most widely used payment instrument in the world and on all continents.: 14  In 17 out of 24 studied countries, cash represents more than 50% of all payment transactions, with Austria at 85%, Germany at 80%, France at 68%. The United Kingdom at 42%, Australia at 37%, United States at 32%, Sweden at 20%, and South Korea at 14% are among the countries with lower cash usage.: 27 
By the 2010s, cash was no longer the preferred method of payment in the United States. In 2016, the United States User Consumer Survey Study reported that three out of four of the participants preferred a debit or credit card payment instead of cash. Some nations have contributed to this trend, by regulating what type of transactions can be conducted with cash and setting limits on the amount of cash that can be used in a single transaction.
Cash is still the primary means of payment (and store of value) for unbanked people with a low income and helps avoiding debt traps due to uncontrolled spending of money. It supports anonymity and avoids tracking for economic or political reasons. In addition, cash is the only means for contingency planning in order to mitigate risks in case of natural disasters or failures of the technical infrastructure like a large-scale power blackout or shutdown of the communication network. Therefore, central banks and governments are increasingly driving the sufficient availability of cash. The US Federal Reserve has provided guidelines for the continuity of cash services, and the Swedish government is concerned about the consequences in abandoning cash and is considering to pass a law requiring all banks to handle cash.


=== Digital and virtual currencies ===

Digital currency is a generic term for various approaches to support secure transactions of the public or using a distributed ledger, like blockchain, as a new technology for decentralized asset management. The blockchain 1.0 era has enabled the application of virtual digital currencies in the marketplace, such as money transfer and payment systems. It considers establishing an electronic version of the national currency which is backed by the central bank as the issuer. Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, such as Bitcoin. Facebook's concept for the diem is based on a token to be backed by financial assets such as a basket of national currencies. 
In 2012, Bank of Canada was considering introducing digital currency. Meanwhile, it rates digital currency a fairly complicated decision and is analyzing the pros and cons and working to determine under which conditions it may make sense to, one day, issue a digital currency. As a threat, a central bank digital currency could increase the risk of a run on the banking system.
Also in 2012, Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, was reported to analyze technological advances with regard to electronic money and payment methods for digital currency as an alternative to cash. In 2019, it is investigating whether Swedish krona need to be made available in electronic form, the so-called e-krona, and if so, how it would affect Swedish legislation and the Riksbank's task. It has started procuring a technical supplier to develop and test solutions for a potential future e-krona. No decisions have yet been taken on issuing an e-krona.


=== Costs of payment ===
An analysis by the Deutsche Bundesbank in 2017 found that a cash payment in retail costs an average of 24 euro cents, while payments with a girocard cost 30 cents (or often 0.3 to 0.4% of sales plus a transaction fee) and with a credit card charge one euro which is included in the sales price. This is why retailers often refuse to accept card payments below a minimum amount. Depending on the account model, there are also booking costs for the account holder with an average of 35 euro cents charged for each(!) account posting. Because of this convenient source of income, commercial banks and credit card companies favor cashless payments.
In the case of cashless payment transactions, in addition to the documentation of the payment itself, the personal details of the payer are usually linked to the data of the payee according to the Know Your Customer (KYC) principle. This enables the payment process to be precisely traced for the payer and the payee. The constant increase in digitization leads to a more detailed recording of cashless payment transactions and their evaluation for advertising and marketing campaigns. Since this digital documentation is usually more centralized than before, the potential for abuse increases. On the other hand, the cash transactions are anonymous, unless purchasing profiles are recorded with the help of loyalty programs based on customer cards, and keep the payment landscape competitive.


== Cash in Constitutions ==


=== Austria ===
In August 2023, Chancellor of Austria Karl Nehammer came out in support for enshrining cash in the Austrian constitution. This came after the Freedom Party of Austria campaigned on the idea.


=== Switzerland ===
In 2023, The Swiss government supported moves to have a constitutional protection for cash. This came after a popular initiative asked for it.


=== Slovakia ===
In June 2023, The Slovakian parliament voted with the support of 111 of 150 MPs to put the right to use Cash in the Constitution of Slovakia. The amendment was proposed by the Sme Rodina party.

Pyre,"A pyre (Ancient Greek: πυρά, romanized: purá; from  πῦρ (pûr) 'fire'), also known as a funeral pyre, is a structure, usually made of wood, for burning a body as part of a funeral rite or execution. As a form of cremation, a body is placed upon or under the pyre, which is then set on fire.
In discussing ancient Greek religion, ""pyre"" (the normal Greek word for fire anglicized) is also used for the sacred fires at altars, on which parts of the animal sacrifice were burnt as an offering to the deity.


== Materials ==
Pyres are crafted using wood. The composition of a pyre may be determined through use of charcoal analysis. Charcoal analysis helps to predict composition of the fuel and local forestry of the charcoal being studied.


=== Ireland ===
Specifically, in the Bronze Age, pyre materials were gathered based on local abundance and ease of access to the wood although materials were also selected due to the specific properties, potential traditional purpose, or due to economical reasons. In Templenoe, pyres typically consisted of oak and fruit wood compositions.


=== Poland ===
From analyzing three necropolises, in Kokotów, Pawłowice and Korytnica, it seems that Polish pyres consisted of primarily Scots pine, birch, and oak trees, as pines, birch, and oak were dense in local woodlands.  All parts of the tree were used including the trunk, branches, twigs, and even pine cones.
During World War II, pyres were used in German death camps on Polish territory, such as Treblinka.


=== Pyre remains in Britain ===
Worked antler and bone objects, along with flint and flake tools, and copper-alloys are most commonly found in pyre cremation remains. The copper-alloys leave a blue-green stain and are typically fused to the ribs, arms, and other areas where jewelry is commonly worn.


==== Analysis of bone fragment size ====
A study was done on the bone fragments of cremations to show that not only will movement of the bone fragments cause breakage but also environmental factors play a part. After studying cremation remains in urns that had been tightly sealed and had no evidence of environmental disturbance it was found that on average bigger bone fragment sizes were observed meaning less bone breakage had occurred. It was concluded that if cremated bone is placed in an urn before burial the original bone fragment size will be preserved. This study was intended to explain that more cautionary measures should be taken during and after any cremation occurs and to educate those who are studying cremated bone that the size of the fragments will be smaller than there were right after cremation.


== Uses ==

Traditionally, pyres are used for the cremation of the dead in the Hindu and Sikh religions, a practice which dates back several thousands of years. Funeral pyres were also used in Germanic and Roman culture.


=== Secular ===
Pyres and bonfires are used in celebrations and remembrance in services. Examples of these are Guy Fawkes Night in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, where the 'Guy', either seen as an effigy of Guy Fawkes or the Pope, is burned.
Funeral pyres were used by the Nazis to cremate the bodies of 1,500,000+ prisoners in Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps, in contrast to the crematoria used in other camps. Pyres have also been used to dispose of large quantities of livestock in agriculture, particularly those infected with disease.
Pyres are lit around the clock in Varanasi, India as it is considered one of the oldest standing cities. Hindu's believe that by resting the ashes of the dead in the Ganges river in at Varanasi, the dead will achieve Moksha. Hindus will travel great lengths in order to perform ritualistic duties such as praying, attending to their dead, or to die.


=== Sati practice in Nepal & India ===
Some Hindu groups practiced Sati (also known as suttee). Sati is the act of volunteered self immolation of a widow of the deceased husband with his corpse or remains. This involves volunteering oneself (and generally being in state of samadhi) to be burnt alive on the pyre with the remains of her husband for higher state of life.


== Environmental impacts of pyres ==


=== Environmental impact in Southern Asia ===

Chakrabarty RK, et al. examined the environmental effects of Southern Asia's funeral pyres in their study, ""Funeral pyres in South Asia: Brown carbon aerosol emissions and climate impacts"". The heating of the atmosphere from carbonaceous aerosols resulting from human activities is a significant contributor to climate change in South Asia. In this region, fossil fuel use and residential biofuels have been documented to be the primary emitter of light-absorbing black carbon aerosols. The study determined the emitted organic carbon contributed 40% to smoke absorption of visible solar radiation, about 92 Gg annually.
A second study examined the carbonaceous fractions associated with indoor PM2.5/PM10 during Asian cultural and ritual burning practices. (Dewangan, et al.) This study concluded drastically higher levels of biomass burning markers within burial rituals performed indoors compared to levels collected for residential indoors and ambient outdoors, with levels reaching three- to eightfold higher levels of carbonaceous aerosols. These high chemical levels were also found to correlate to higher aerosol fraction levels during winter months in both Muslim Holy Shrines and marriage places. The study concluded PM concentrations were significantly higher in indoor-ritual locations and suggested further studies and actions be taken to investigate risk and health assessment and calls for regulatory agencies to propose new guidelines for indoor cultural/ritual locations.


=== Environmental impacts in India ===
A traditional Hindu funeral pyre takes six hours and burns 500–600 kg (1,102–1,323 pounds) of wood to burn a body completely. Every year fifty to sixty million trees are burned during cremations in India, which results in about eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollution, deforestation and large quantities of ash, which are later thrown into rivers, adding to the toxicity of its waters, pose great environmental problems.
The Green Revolution Foundation, under its parent organization Sarthak Charitable Trust, is a Delhi-based NGO working to reduce the environmental impact of funeral pyres. They claim to have created an alternative to wood-based funeral pyres, which reduces the number of trees which need to be cut down. Their alternative also promotes the Swachh Bharat Mission. As a result, the cost is reduced significantly and emissions are cut by up to 60%.


== Legality of open-air pyres ==
In ancient times burning bodies was a practiced form of burial. Open-air cremations, known as funeral pyres, are uncommon and even illegal in some countries, particularly in the Western World, because it is considered taboo. While cremation is commonplace, open air cremations in the United Kingdom were considered to be unlawful under the Cremation Act 1902. The law was created to prevent the creation of a private cremation industry and because of issues concerning property. But at the time environmental concerns did not play any factor in the creation of the law.
In February 2010, a Hindu man named Davender Ghai was granted permission to be cremated on a traditional open-air pyre, when a court of appeals in the United Kingdom ruled them legal inside of a building with an open roof and away from roads or homes. In the U.S., a group in Crestone, Colorado, a part of the Crestone End of Life Project, obtained legal permission to perform ""open-air cremations"". Others have attempted to open up more outdoor funeral pyres but have faced disapproval. Crestone, Colorado is the only place where open-air cremations are legal in the United States. They can perform around 12 a year, regardless of religion and families can be involved in the process if they would like. At this time, the group only allows people who are part of the local community to choose this alternative burial.


== Roman pyres ==
In the time leading up to the 2nd century AD popular funeral practices in Rome consisted of cremation with a pyre.  Ideal funeral practices meant burning an ornamental pyre for the deceased, that would burn with enough heat and a long enough time to only leave ashes and small bone fragments.  Having to use another's pyre was a sign of poverty or emergency cases.
The process of constructing and properly burning a funeral pyre is a skilled task.  Often, pyres would not burn with enough heat to properly cremate human remains.  Pyres had to be maintained by stoking the flame and raking the pyre to allow good oxygen flow.  Ancient literature refers to the skilled job of an ustor, meaning a professional pyre builder derived from the Latin word 'ūrere' which means, to burn. However, regardless of professional build, pyres were unpredictable and would go wrong on a regular basis.  The Elder Pliny writes of extreme cases in which bodies have been thrown from the pyre from the force of the flames. Other cases, described by Plutarch, involving deceased victims of poisoning, resulted in the human body bursting open and dousing the pyre.


== Forensic evaluation of pyres ==
A study conducted by Alunni, et al. examined the forensic science behind cremations on wooden pyres. The study concluded the average pyre does not completely destroy a human body effectively, and differences in suicide via pyres are evident in the remains. A pyre suicide shows signs of remains being more charred rather than completely oxidized by high temperatures, are in anatomically correct positions, poor bone fragmentation, and is without suspicious burn patterns compared to an individual murdered via pyre. Cremated remains are different from traditional human remains in the sense that their physical appearance including bone vary in color, fragmentation, and differ from their original shape and dimension. This is why forensic experimental studies are necessary to fully understand the differences the body undergoes in a pyre. Coloring of bones before cremation is dependent on oxygen exposure, duration, and temperature. The bone color can range from black to brown or an oxidized white color. The type of bone and method of cooling may also alter the bone form. Cooling is also an important consideration, for if the remains are cooled via water it increases warping. This knowledge is a consideration for archaeologists to understand the remains from pyres.

Fireboats of Jamaica,"The Jamaican Fire Brigade operates several fireboats of Jamaica.
According to a 2003 article in the Jamaica Gleaner the three fireboats then nominally operated by the Fire Brigade were all in a state of disrepair, and had all been out of service for months—or in the case of one vessel—years.  According to another Gleaner article the stations were dangerously over-run with rats and other vermin.
In 2005 the Jamaica Star reported that after the fireboat assigned to the Kingston Fire Boat Station had been out of service for most of 2004—being sent for repair four separate times, the staff were assigned to other duties when the fireboat was placed permanently offline.
By 2012, the fireboat that served Montego Bay, Jamaica's second most important port, had been without a fireboat for over five years, as the previous boat had been written off as not worth repairing, but had yet to be replaced.
Both the mayor of Montego Bay, Glendon Harris, and Jamaica Senator Robert Montague have called for the urgent supply of new fireboats.
In November 2013 Alrick Hacker a Senior Deputy Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, defended the Brigade's replacement plans and outlined the interim measures in place until the new boats were in service.
Jamaica's three new Jamaican Coast Guard patrol cutters all mount a water cannon in their bow, and Hacker said the Coast Guard had been requested to help out until the Brigade's new fireboats were ready.  He said the Police Marine units also had some firefighting capability, and they too had been asked to help out.  He asserted that modern cruise ships, the foreign vessels of most acute concern, were built more fire-safe than in the past, and had the capability to fight their own fires, to a certain extent.
Hacker asserted that new technology would allow the Fire Brigade to replace their older, relatively large vessels with smaller, faster, more capable vessels, that would be cheaper to operate and to maintain.
In 2018 the Fire Brigade acquired two new fireboats.

Triplochiton scleroxylon,"Triplochiton scleroxylon is a tree of the genus Triplochiton of the family Malvaceae. The timber is known by the common names African whitewood, abachi, obeche (in Nigeria), wawa (in Ghana), ayous (in Cameroon) and sambawawa (in Ivory Coast). The tree is the official state tree of Ekiti State, Nigeria.


== Description ==
The species is distributed over the tropical areas of West Africa and Central Africa.


== Uses ==

The timber yielded is typically pale yellow and is moderately soft and light for a hardwood.

The timber is used in the manufacture of veneer, furniture, picture frames and mouldings. It is also used by guitar makers. Gibson and Fender Japan have used the wood to produce limited edition guitars.
The tree is a host of the African silk moth, Anaphe venata, whose caterpillars feed on the leaves and spin cocoons which are then used to make silk.
The wood is exploited in its natural habitat, a harvest that is unsustainable in some areas. However, it remains classed as 'least concern' on the IUCN Red List.

Rejuvenation,"Rejuvenation is the reversal of ageing.


== Approach ==
Ageing is the accumulation of cellular and molecular damage on the body. If this damage can be repaired, it is rejuvenation.
The SENS Research Foundation founded by Aubrey de Grey classified seven types of damages that lead to ageing. The organization also proposed strategies for repairing these (Strategies for engineered negligible senescence).

Döbereiner's lamp,"Döbereiner's lamp is one of the first lighters. It was developed in 1823 by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner. The lighter was produced until around 1880. The Heidelberg Castle and also the Deutsches Museum (German Museum) still have original Döbereiner lamps to show.
The lighter works based on a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. In the glass cylinder (a in the picture on the right) is sulfuric acid. In the open bottle (b) is zinc and at the top is a valve. With the lever (f), the bottle will be opened. Then, the sulfuric acid flows into the bottle. When it reaches the Zinc, a reaction starts. It produces hydrogen.

The hydrogen can go out of the bottle at the top. Next to the valve, there is platinum. The hydrogen gas has to bypass the platinum. The hydrogen and the oxygen from the air react because of the catalytic effect of platinum. The gas mixture (called oxyhydrogen) then burns, because the reaction is exothermic, and produces water.

To stop this reaction, the bottle only needs to be closed, that means the lever needs to be released. The hydrogen can no longer go out of the bottle and pushes the sulfuric acid back into the glass cylinder.

Cool flame,"A cool flame is a flame having a typical temperature of about 400 °C (752 °F). In contrast to an ordinary hot flame, the reaction is not vigorous and releases little heat, light, or carbon dioxide. Cool flames are difficult to observe and are uncommon in everyday life, but they are responsible for engine knock – the undesirable, erratic, and noisy combustion of low-octane fuels in internal combustion engines.


== History ==
Cool flames were accidentally discovered in the 1810s by Sir Humphry Davy, who inserted a hot platinum wire into a mixture of air and diethyl ether vapor.  ""When the experiment on the slow combustion of ether is made in the dark, a pale phosphorescent light is perceived above the wire, which of course is most distinct when the wire ceases to be ignited. This appearance is connected with the formation of a peculiar acrid volatile substance possessed of acid properties."": 79   After noticing that certain types of flame did not burn his fingers or ignite a match, he also found that those unusual flames could change into hot flames and that at certain compositions and temperatures, they did not require an external ignition source, such as a spark or hot material.
Harry Julius Emeléus was the first to record their emission spectra, and in 1929 he coined the term ""cold flame"".


== Parameters ==

Cool flames can occur in hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, oils, acids, waxes, and even methane. The lowest temperature of a cool flame is poorly defined and is conventionally set as a temperature at which the flame can be detected by eye in a dark room (cool flames are hardly visible in daylight). This temperature slightly depends on the fuel to oxygen ratio and strongly depends on gas pressure – there is a threshold below which cool flame is not formed. A specific example is 50% n-butane–50% oxygen (by volume) which has a cool flame temperature (CFT) of about 300 °C (572 °F) at 165 mmHg (22.0 kPa). One of the lowest CFTs (156 °C (313 °F)) was reported for a C2H5OC2H5 + O2 + N2 mixture at 300 mmHg (40 kPa). The CFT is significantly lower than the auto-ignition temperature (AIT) of conventional flame (see table).
The spectra of cool flames consist of several bands and are dominated by the blue and violet ones – thus the flame usually appears pale blue. The blue component originates from the excited state of formaldehyde (CH2O*) which is formed via chemical reactions in the flame:

A cool flame does not start instantaneously after the threshold pressure and temperature are applied, but has an induction time. The induction time shortens and the glow intensity increases with increasing pressure. With increasing temperature, the intensity may decrease because of the disappearance of peroxy radicals required for the above glow reactions.
Self-sustained, stable cool diffusion flames have been established by adding ozone into oxidizer stream.


== Mechanism ==
Whereas in a hot flame molecules break down to small fragments and combine with oxygen producing carbon dioxide (i.e., burn), in a cool flame, the fragments are relatively large and easily recombine with each other. Therefore, much less heat, light and carbon dioxide is released; the premixed combustion process is oscillatory and can sustain for a long time. A typical temperature increase upon ignition of a cool flame is a few tens of degrees Celsius whereas it is on the order of 1,000 °C (1,830 °F) for a hot flame. 
Most experimental data can be explained by the model which considers cool flame just as a slow chemical reaction where the rate of heat generation is higher than the heat loss. This model also explains the oscillatory character of the cool premixed flame: the reaction accelerates as it produces more heat until the heat loss becomes appreciable and temporarily quenches the process.


== Cool diffusion flames ==
Unlike a cool premixed flame, a cool diffusion flame (CDF) burns in the presence of an equivalence ratio gradient. CDFs were first observed in 2012 in droplet experiments aboard the International Space Station. Since then CDFs have been observed in microgravity spherical flames burning droplets and gases and in normal gravity counterflow and stratified flames.


== Applications ==
Cool flames may contribute to engine knock – the undesirable, erratic, and noisy combustion of low-octane fuels in internal combustion engines. In a normal spark-ignition engine, the hot premixed flame front travels smoothly in the combustion chamber from the spark plug, compressing the fuel/air mixture ahead. However, the concomitant increase in pressure and temperature may produce a cool flame in the last unburned fuel-air mixture (the so-called end gasses) and participate in the autoignition of the end gasses. 
This sudden, localized heat release generates a shock wave which travels through the combustion chamber, with its sudden pressure rise causing an audible knocking sound. Worse, the shock wave disrupts the thermal boundary layer on the piston surface, causing overheating and eventual melting. The output power decreases and, unless the throttle (or load) is cut off quickly, the engine can be damaged as described in a few minutes. The sensitivity of a fuel to a cool-flame ignition strongly depends on the temperature, pressure and composition. 
The cool flame initiation of the knock process is likely only in highly throttled operating conditions, since cool flames are observed at low pressures. Under normal operating conditions, autoignition occurs without being triggered by a cool flame. Whereas the temperature and pressure of the combustion are largely determined by the engine, the composition can be controlled by various antiknock additives. The latter mainly aim at removing the radicals (such as CH2O* mentioned above) thereby suppressing the major source of the cool flame.

Holznot,"Holznot (German for wood crisis) is a historic term for an existing or imminent supply crisis of wood.


== Historical use ==

In particular, the concept was applied to Central Europe around the end of the 16th century until the start of the early 19th century in numerous sources. In almost all German-speaking regions, a wood shortage and resulting wood-saving measures became an important topic.
Forestry and history scholars did not dispute the wood shortage per se for a long time. Besides the tragedy of the commons legend, the alleged Holznot was critical to motivate the shift from forest use as part of subsistence agriculture to modern professional forestry and was an important base of the development of modern forestry science around 1800. Around the 1980s, environmental historian Joachim Radkau began raising doubts about the alleged 18th-century wood shortage started a research controversy among German historians, called the ""Holznotdebatte"". Radkau debated e.g. with Rolf Peter Sieferle about the existence, extent, and spatial and social impact of perceived or real existing wood shortages and the associated ideological and economic background. Radkau doubted the Holznot had existed at all. Similar as with the tragedy of the commons he saw a strong ideological motive to get rid of the traditional farmers' forest access.
Radkau repeats Werner Sombart's notion of the pre-industrial phase as a ""Wooden Age"", where wood
constituted the key substance for fuel energy, construction and machinery. While Sombart was positive about the change to an ""iron age"", Radkau is critical about the alleged decline of ""wooden civilisation"". Before the industrial century, the ""wood brake"", as he names it, was a component of stability, of the ecology and the traditional economic and social order. In connection with the first medieval mining rushes in the Ore Mountains (""Berggeschrey"") regional wood shortages gave rise to the first use of sustainability in German forestry.
However, the situation began to change in the 16th century, as meeting point of the capitalist expansion and the formation of the absolutist state. From the 16th century, world maritime trade, housing construction in Europe, and the mountain mining industry brought a sharp rise in timber consumption. The absolutist state asked for a new order of the use of forests and area property rights at the expense of livestock grazing and traditional forest use, as in resin extraction. Complaints about wood shortages served, according Radkau, to legitimate state intervention and to exclude traditional groups of users such as resin workers and wood pasture in favour of more profitable timber consumers.


== Peak wood ==
The term peak wood refers to the point in time when the maximum rate of wood harvesting is reached. The term 'peak' refers to the Hubbert peak of a resource. Thus peak wood and peak oil cannot be compared directly.
Unlike resources such as petroleum, which are destroyed in use, wood continually grows and recycled, but it requires habitat (forests, woodland and timber plantations).
Author Steve Hallett argues in the 2011 book Life Without Oil that deforestation during the Roman period may have ultimately caused the fall of the Roman Empire. As wood had to be hauled from ever further away, Hallett suggests the law of diminishing returns undermined the economic performance of Roman industry, leaving Rome vulnerable to other, well documented problems of invasion and internal division. Hallett presents the history as a cautionary tale, drawing comparisons to contemporary society's potential fate following a peak oil scenario.

Poniatowski gems,"Prince Stanisław Poniatowski (1754–1833) was a a wealthy Polish nobleman.
He inherited approximately 154 antique gems from his uncle, King Stanisław August Poniatowski of Poland, who died in 1798. He then commissioned gems to be made, to look similar to those he had inherited. He was given more than 2,600 engraved gems. When he died in 1833, it became clear that the gems were forgeries.  At first, people had thought that they were real classical pieces. In 1839, they were sold at an auction. That auction was a failure. Today, the gems have been scattered, and many have been lost. Those that remain are seen as good examples of neoclassical carving. These gems are known as Poniatowski gems today.

Weathering,"Weathering is the breaking down of rocks, soil and their minerals through direct contact with the Earth's atmosphere, waters, or living things. It is a natural process. 
Weathering occurs in one place with little or no movement, and should not be confused with erosion which is when rocks and minerals are moved to another place by ice, water, wind or gravity.


== Mechanical weathering ==
Mechanical or physical weathering is when the rocks and minerals are broken down but the chemical composition remains the same. Mechanical weathering physically breaks up rock. 


=== Wind ===
Wind can blow water or small particles such as sand against the rock thus breaking it down.


=== Rain ===
Rain is another force that works slowly. The force of raindrops on some rocks make them wear down. Rain also can make a chemical change in some rocks, because it is usually slightly acidic. The water mixes with the minerals in the rock to break it down.


=== Temperature ===

Changing temperature can make a rock crack. Every day when the sun shines on the rock, its surface is heated. Heat causes the surface to expand (get bigger) a little. The inside of the rock, though, does not heat up as fast as the outside of the rock. The inside of the rock stays cooler. At night, the surface cools down and contracts. The expanding and contracting makes some places on the surface weak, and a crack is made.
Also, if water gets into a crack in a rock and the temperature goes below the freezing point, the water will freeze and expand. After some time, the rock may be weak enough to break into pieces.


=== Ice ===
Ice, which can be miles thick, grinds the surface of the rock below it. The particles are carried with the ice, and if a glacier ends up in the sea, so does all the material carried with it.


=== Lava or magma ===
Lava or magma can cause weathering when molten rock touches older rock. It causes the older rock to change form to a different crystal structure.


== Chemical weathering ==
Chemical weathering is the breaking down of rock which changes the chemical composition.


=== Carbon dioxide cycle ===
The carbon dioxide cycle is the most important for weathering. CO2 is put into the atmosphere mostly by volcanoes, and it is taken out of the atmosphere by photosynthesis, and by one other process. 
While it is in the air, CO2 can dissolve in water droplets to form weak carbonic acid.
When rain hits rock it does so with mechanical energy and dilute acid. The acid dissolves many types of minerals and rocks though, of course, very slowly. When a mineral like feldspar is dissolved, it lets sodium ions into the sea; chlorine ions come from other minerals. The sea tastes salty because of the elements which have been dissolved out of rocks.

LGBT,"LGBT is an initialism that means lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. It refers to the  community of people who are not heterosexual, which means to be attracted to the other gender, or cisgender, which means to identify as the gender you were born as.  It has been taken up by many sexuality and gender identity-related community centers.


== History ==
Before the ""sexual revolution"" of the 1960s, there was no neutral word or group of words for people who were not heterosexual. 
The word ""homosexual""  started being used in America to describe sexual orientations that were not heterosexual. However, this word began to have bad connotations, as many people thought that it sounded like a condition or mental illness, and therefore the word ""homophile"" was used instead. After that, the word ""gay"" replaced the word ""homophile"" in the 1970s.
As lesbians became more public about their sexuality in the 1970s, the group of words ""gay and lesbian"" was often used, and a phase of lesbian feminism started. This meant that certain lesbian feminist groups separated because did not have knowledge of if they should put feminism or LGBT rights first.
Lesbian feminists viewed the separation between ""butch"" and ""femme"" in mainstream gay (male) culture of the time in the same way that they viewed the separation in society over gender roles between men and women. They saw these ideas as patriarchal and did not want to join the mainstream gay rights movement because of what they saw as the chauvinism of gay men, and refused to take up their cause. Many lesbians who were not lesbian feminists saw this as not giving help to the gay rights movement.
This was followed by many bisexual and transgender people wanting to be seen as respected groups in the LGBT community. Before gender reassignment surgery was massively improved in later years, transgender people had a hard time being accepted. Still, they fought for their rights, and were greatly boosted when plastic surgery and hormone surgery helped them to be accepted as the gender they identify with. 
After the Stonewall riots, there was a change in points of view among the gay and lesbian community. Many gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual and transgender persons in general. Many gays and lesbians thought that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and that bisexuals were actually gay, but in too much fear to ""come out of the closet"". This separation still exists today, and it only became common to speak of all members of the LGBT community with equal respect in the trouble for LGBT rights in the late 1990s.


== Acceptance of LGBT people ==
Some people who are LGBT may not ""come out"", as they may be a target of discrimination or prejudice, such as homophobia or transphobia. Many countries have discriminatory laws against LGBT people, some even giving out the death penalty for being gay or bisexual.


== Different forms of the acronym ==


=== Shortening of the term ===
When not including transgender persons in general, the acronym is sometimes shortened to just ""LGB"".


=== Other letters ===

Many other letters are added to the acronym, so much so that it has been described as an ""alphabet soup"" by some. A few of the other letters added are:

Queer or Questioning—added to the acronym to make it more inclusive.
Intersex—recorded use in the acronym since 1999. (This acronym is used in all parts of ""The Activist's Guide"" of the Yogyakarta Principles in Action.)
Asexual, Aromantic or Agender
Pansexual— however, ""pansexual"" is often thought of as being a category of ""bisexuality"", as well as the terms ""omnisexual"" and ""fluid"".
Hijra—the acronym LGBTIH has seen use in India, in order to join the traditional Indian hijra third gender identity and the related subculture.
Non-binary
Demisexual
Not everyone is in agreement what should or should not be covered in the acronym, or which order the letters should go in.


=== Different terms ===
The group of words gender and sexual diversity (GSD) has been shown as a different option to LGBT by some, as it is seen as more inclusive and less limiting.
SGL (same-gender loving) is sometimes used among gay male African Americans as a way of distinguishing themselves from what they think of as white LGBT groups of persons.
MSM (men who have sex with men) is used to describe men who have sex with other men without having relation to their sexual orientation, often in a medical context.
WSW (women who have sex with women) is the opposite of MSM. It includes all women who have sex with women.
AMAB (assigned male at birth) is used to describe people who were assigned the male sex at birth.
AFAB (assigned female at birth) is used to describe people who were assigned the female sex at birth.
AIAB (assigned intersex at birth) is used to describe people who were assigned intersex at birth.
MOGAI (marginalized orientations and gender alignments or identities and intersex) is a term somebody can use instead of using the term LGBT. MOGAI treats the idea of gender modality as more important than these other words do. It is an umbrella term because it is about many different kinds of people: A gay man and a trans woman, for example, are both MOGAI.

Sandalwood,"Sandalwood is a class of woods from trees in the genus Santalum. The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and, unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods. Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world. Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries. Consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have suffered over-harvesting in the past.


== Nomenclature ==
The nomenclature and the taxonomy of the genus are derived from this species' historical and widespread use. Etymologically it is ultimately derived from Sanskrit चन्दन Chandana (čandana), meaning ""wood for burning incense"" and related to candrah, ""shining, glowing"" and the Latin candere, to shine or glow. It arrived in English via Late Greek, Medieval Latin and Old French in the 14th or 15th century.


== True sandalwoods ==

Sandalwoods are medium-sized hemiparasitic trees, and part of the same botanical family as European mistletoe. Sandalwood is indigenous to the tropical belt of the peninsular India, Malay Archipelago and northern Australia. The main distribution is in the drier tropical regions of India and the Indonesian islands of Timor and Sumba. It spread to other regions through the incense trade route by the vast Indian and Arab mercantile networks and the Chinese maritime trade routes until the sixteenth century CE. The sandalwood of peninsular India and the Malay Archipelago supported most consumption in East Asia and West Asia during the time of the incense trade route before the commercialization of Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum) in sandalwood plantations in Australia and China,  although sandalwood album (Santalum album) is still considered to have the best and original quality in terms of religion and alternative medicine. Santalum spicatum is marketed as the notable members of this group today by merchants because of its stable sources; others in the genus also have fragrant wood. These are found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, Indonesia, Hawaii, and other Pacific Islands, 

S. album is a threatened species native to dry tropical regions of Indonesia (Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands), the Philippines, and Western Australia. It was one of the plants exploited by Austronesian arboriculture and it was introduced by Austronesian sailors to East Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia during the ancient spice trade, becoming naturalized in South India by at least 1300 BCE. In India, the principal sandal tracts are most parts of Karnataka and adjoining districts of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Although sandalwood trees in India, Pakistan, and Nepal are government-owned and their harvest is controlled, many trees are illegally cut down. Sandalwood oil prices had risen to $3000 per liter by 2017.
S. ellipticum, S. freycinetianum, and S. paniculatum, the Hawaiian sandalwood (ʻiliahi), were also used and considered high quality. These three species were exploited between 1790 and 1825 before the supply of trees ran out (a fourth species, S. haleakalae, occurs only in subalpine areas and was never exported). Although S. freycinetianum and S. paniculatum are relatively common today, they have not regained their former abundance or size, and S. ellipticum remains rare.
S. yasi, a sandalwood from Fiji and Tonga.
S. spicatum is used by aromatherapists and perfumers. The oil concentration differs considerably from other Santalum species. In the 1840s, sandalwood was Western Australia's biggest export earner. Oil was distilled for the first time in 1875, and by the turn of the 20th century, production of Australian sandalwood oil was intermittent. However, in the late 1990s, Western Australian sandalwood oil enjoyed a revival and by 2009 had peaked at more than 20,000 kg (44,000 lb) per year – much of which went to the fragrance industries in Europe. Although overall production has decreased, by 2011, a significant percentage of its production was heading to the chewing tobacco industry in India alongside Indian sandalwood – the chewing tobacco market being the largest market for both oils in 2012.
Other species: Commercially, various other species, not belonging to Santalum species, are also used as sandalwood.


=== Unrelated plants ===
Various unrelated plants with scented wood and also referred to as sandalwood, but not in the true sandalwood genus:

Adenanthera pavonina – sandalwood tree, red or false red sandalwood
Baphia nitida – camwood, also known as African sandalwood
Eremophila mitchellii – sandalwood; false sandalwood (also sandalbox)
Myoporum platycarpum – sandalwood; false sandalwood
Myoporum sandwicense – bastard sandalwood, false sandalwood
Osyris lanceolata – African sandalwood
Osyris tenuifolia – east African sandalwood
Pterocarpus santalinus – false red sandalwood growing in southern Indian regions


== Production ==

Producing commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils requires Indian sandalwood (S. album) trees to be a minimum of 15 years old – the yield, quality and volume are still to be clearly understood. Yield of oil tends to vary depending on the age and location of the tree; usually, the older trees yield the highest oil content and quality. India continues to produce a superior quality of Santalum Album, with FP Aromatics being the largest exporter. Australia is the largest producer of S. album, with the majority grown around Kununurra, in the far north of the state by Quintis (formerly Tropical Forestry Services), which in 2017 controlled around 80% of the world's supply of Indian sandalwood, and Santanol. India used to be the world's biggest producer, but it has been overtaken by Australia in the 21st century. Over-exploitation is partly to blame for the decline.   However, ethical plantations in India are on the rise, and India is expected to increase its supply manyfold by 2030, owing to favourable weather conditions and competitive pricing.
Australian sandalwood (S. spicatum) is grown in commercial plantations throughout the wheatbelt of Western Australia, where it has been an important part of the economy since colonial times. As of 2020 WA has the largest plantation resource in the world.
Sandalwood is expensive compared to other types of woods. To maximize profit, sandalwood is harvested by removing the entire tree instead of felling at the trunk near ground level. This way wood from the stump and root, which possesses high levels of sandalwood oil, can also be processed and sold.
Australian sandalwood is mostly harvested and sold in log form, graded for heartwood content. The species is unique in that the white sapwood does not require removal before distilling the oil. The logs are either processed to distill the essential oil, or made into powders for making incense. Indian sandalwood, used mainly for oil extraction, does require removal of the sapwood prior to distillation. As of 2020, Australian Sandalwood oil sells for around US$1,500 per 1 kilogram (2.2 lb), while Indian Sandalwood oil, due to its higher alpha santalol content, is priced at about US$2,500 per kg.
Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with African blackwood, pink ivory, agarwood and ebony.
Sandalwood has historically been an important tree in the development of the political economy of the Pacific. Prior to colonization in the region, the sandalwood tree was a marker of status, rank and beauty. It then became an important part of the Pacific trade during the colonial period, as it was one of the few resources the West was able to successfully trade with Chinese merchants. This western trade began to put pressure on the production of sandalwood in the region.
Tonga, a Polynesian kingdom in the Oceania region, saw a severe depletion of its sandalwood tree (locally known as “‘ahi”) due a disruption of the social hierarchy, known as “fahu”, which led to heightened local competition and eventually an over harvest. Nearly all of the sandalwood resources were depleted over the span of two years.
Tongan people have a unique social dynamic referred to as “fahu.”  On the one hand, the kinship system of fahu is able to ensure biodiversity and sustainability in contemporary Tonga. But on the other hand, a principal factor in the over harvest of the ‘ahi tree was the result of the defensive actions of farmers defying fahu customs. As sandalwood became valuable in the market, lower-ranking family members began to harvest the trees without permission, encouraging many farmers to harvest their trees defensively and thus leading to over harvest. 
In 2007, Mike Evans published a scholarly report on Tongan sandalwood overharvest and the socio-environmental implications of resource commodification and privatized land tenure. Evan’s concluded that “whatever the short-term ecological benefits of enforcing privatized land tenure, because private property not only fragments social ties by allowing an individual to deny others, it has the potential to fragment the regional ecology as well.”


== Uses ==


=== Fragrance ===

Sandalwood oil has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy, and milky precious-wood scent. Its quality and scent profile is greatly influenced by the age of the tree, location and the skill of the distiller. It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, fougère, and chypre families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. When used in smaller proportions in a perfume, it acts as a fixative, enhancing the longevity of other, more volatile, materials in the composite. Sandalwood is also a key ingredient in the ""floriental"" (floral-ambery) fragrance family – when combined with white florals such as jasmine, ylang ylang, gardenia, plumeria, orange blossom, tuberose, lily of the valley, etc. Its also acts as a versatile base that blends well with other woody scents like patchouli and cedar.
Sandalwood oil in India is widely used in the cosmetic industry. The main source of true sandalwood, S. album, is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as ""sandalwood"". The genus Santalum has more than 19 species. Traders often accept oil from closely related species, as well as from unrelated plants such as West Indian sandalwood (Amyris balsamifera) in the family Rutaceae or bastard sandalwood (Myoporum sandwicense, Myoporaceae). However, most woods from these alternative sources lose their aroma within a few months or years.
Isobornyl cyclohexanol is a synthetic fragrance chemical produced as an alternative to the natural product.
Sandalwood's main components are the two isomers of santalol (about 75%). It is used in aromatherapy, in scented candles and to prepare soaps.


=== Idols/sculptures ===
Sandalwood lends itself well to carving and has thus, traditionally, been a wood of choice for statues and sculptures of Hindu gods.


=== Technology ===
Due to its low fluorescence and optimal refractive index, sandalwood oil is often employed as an immersion oil within ultraviolet and fluorescence microscopy.


=== Food ===
Aboriginal Australians eat the seed kernels, nuts, and fruit of local sandalwoods, such as the quandong (S. acuminatum).
Early Europeans in Australia used quandong in cooking damper by infusing it with its leaves, and in making jams, pies, and chutneys from the fruit. In Scandinavia, pulverised bark from red sandalwood (Pterocarpus soyauxii) is used - with other tropical spices - when marinating anchovies and some types of pickled herring such as matjes, sprat, and certain types of traditional spegesild, inducing a reddish colour and slightly perfumed flavour.
Present-day chefs have begun experimenting in using the nut as a substitute for macadamia nuts or a bush food substitute for almonds, hazelnuts, and others in Southeast Asian-styled cuisine. The oil is also used as a flavour component in different food items, including candy, ice cream, baked food, puddings, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and gelatin. The flavouring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.


== Distillation ==

Oil is extracted from Sandalwood through distillation. Many different methods are used, including steam distillation, water distillation, CO2 extraction, and solvent extractions. Steam distillation is the most common method used by sandalwood companies. It occurs in a four-step process, incorporating boiling, steaming, condensation, and separation. Water is heated to high temperatures (60–100 °C or 140–212 °F) and is then passed through the wood. The oil is very tightly bound within the cellular structure of the wood, but can be released by the high heat of the steam. The mixture of steam and oil is then cooled and separated so that the essential oil can be collected. This process is much longer than any other essential oil's distillation, taking 14 to 36 hours to complete, but generally produces much higher quality oil. Water, or hydro, distillation is the more traditional method of sandalwood extraction which involves soaking the wood in water and then boiling it until the oil is released. This method is not used as much anymore because of the high costs and time associated with heating large quantities of water.


== Religion ==


=== Hinduism ===

Sandalwood is considered sacred in the Hindu Ayurveda and is known in Sanskrit as chandana. The wood is used for worshipping the deities, and it is said that  Lakshmi (Sri), the goddess of well-being, lives in the sandalwood tree; therefore, it is also known as Srigandha. 
Sandalwood paste is prepared by grinding a piece of dry sandalwood into powder, against a stone slab. With the gradual addition of water, a thick paste forms, (called kalabham ""കളഭം"" in Malayalam language and gandha ಗಂಧ in Kannada) and it is mixed with saffron or other such pigments to make chandanam. Chandanam, further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments, and some other compounds, results in javadhu. Kalabham, chandanam, and javadhu are dried and used as kalabham powder, chandanam powder, and javadhu powder, respectively. Chandanam powder is very popular in India and is also used in Nepal. 
In Tirupati, after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In Hinduism and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies.
This paste is integral to rituals and ceremonies, for making religious utensils, for decorating sacred images, and it is believed to calm the mind during meditation and prayer. It is also distributed to devotees, who apply it to their foreheads or necks and chests. Sandalwood paste is used for most pujas both in temples and private households.


=== Jainism ===

Sandalwood use is an integral part of the daily practices of Jainism. Sandalwood paste mixed with saffron is used to worship the Tirthankaras of Jainism. Sandalwood powder is showered as blessings by Jain monks and nuns (sadhus and sadhvis) onto their disciples and followers. Sandalwood garlands are used to dress the body during Jain cremation ceremonies. During the festival of Mahamastakabhisheka that is held once in every 12 years, the Gommateshwara statue is bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, turmeric, and vermilion.


=== Buddhism ===
Sandalwood is mentioned in various suttas of the Pāli Canon. In some Buddhist traditions, sandalwood is considered to be of the padma (lotus) group and attributed to Amitabha Buddha. Sandalwood scent is believed by some to transform one's desires and maintain a person's alertness while in meditation. It is also one of the most popular scents used when offering incense to the Buddha and the guru.


=== Sufism ===
In the Indian variants of Sufism, sandalwood paste is applied on a revered Sufi's grave by the disciples as a mark of devotion. The tradition is practiced particularly by devotees in the Indian Subcontinent. In Tamil culture, irrespective of one's religious identity, sandalwood paste or powder is applied to the graves of Sufi saints as a mark of devotion and respect.


=== East Asian religions ===
In East Asia, sandalwood (檀木), is the most commonly used incense material by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese in worship and various ceremonies. Some Taoist sects, following the Ming Dynasty Taoist Manual, avoid the use of sandalwood (as well as benzoin resin and frankincense) as incense in worship. In Korean Shamanism, sandalwood is considered the Tree of Life. It was transmitted to China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan during the eastward expansion of Buddhism.: 3 


=== Zoroastrianism ===
Zoroastrians offer sandalwood twigs to the afarganyu, the urn in which the fire is kept at the fire temple (called agiyari in Gujarati and dar-e mehr in Persian), to keep the fire burning during religious ceremonies. After the firekeeping priests complete the ceremony, attendees are allowed to come up to the afarganyu and place their own pieces of sandalwood into the fire. Fire has been a sacred symbol in the Zoroastrian religion since ancient times and it is considered very important to keep the fires in the temples constantly burning. Because of its high sensitivity to fire, sandalwood works very well for this. Also, the wood has been accepted by the Yasna and Yashts (sacred texts) as an appropriate fuel for the fire. It is offered to all of the three grades of fire in the fire temple, including the Atash Dadgahs. Sandalwood is not offered to the divo, a smaller lamp that is kept in the homes of Zoroastrians. Often, money is offered to the mobad (priest) as payment, along with sandalwood. Sandalwood is called sukhad in the Zoroastrian community. The sandalwood in the fire temple is often more expensive to buy than at a Zoroastrian store. It is often a source of income for the fire temple.

DGSAT I,"DGSAT I is a quenched, ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) located on the outskirts of the Pisces-Perseus Supercluster, identified in 2016 during a visual inspection of a full color image of the Andromeda II dwarf galaxy. DGSAT I resides in a low-density environment compared to the densities where UDGs are typically found. Its chemical makeup have led astronomers to propose it was formed during the dawn of the universe when galaxies emerged in a different environment than today.


== Discovery and identification ==
DGSAT I was first identified by the DGSAT project in 2016. The DGSAT (Dwarf Galaxy Survey with Amateur Telescopes) uses the potential of privately owned small-sized telescopes to probe low surface brightness (LSB) features around large galaxies and aims to increase the sample size of the dwarf satellite galaxies in the Local Volume.
At first astronomers thought DGSAT I to be an isolated dwarf galaxy beyond the Local Group due to its structural properties and absence of emission lines. A spectroscopic observation later revealed DGSAT I to be a background system and likely associated with an outer filament of the Pisces-Perseus super-cluster.


== Chemical composition ==
The chemical composition of a galaxy provides record of the ambient conditions during its formation. The mass ratios of alpha-elements such as magnesium to iron ([Mg/Fe]) trace time-scales for star formation, as these elements are produced by stars according to different lifetimes. Younger galaxies tend to have more heavy elements in its chemical makeup compared to ancient galaxies formed during an early age of the universe.
DGSAT I's integral field spectroscopy data shows a remarkably low iron content, suggesting an early galaxy formed from a nearly pristine gas cloud, unpolluted by the supernova death of previous stars, however its magnesium levels are consistent with what astronomers expect to find in younger galaxies. This apparent chemical makeup discrepancy and DGSAT I's isolation from galaxy clusters are helping astronomers to develop new theories concerning the birth and formation of UDGs.
UDGs are hard to observe due to their extremely low luminosity but there are studies being conducted using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager in an attempt to shed light on the precise relation between DGSAT I's metallicity and its possibly exotic origin. A paper published in 2022 proposed DGSAT I to be a “failed galaxy” that formed relatively few stars in proportion to its halo mass, and could be related to cluster UDGs whose size and quiescence pre-date their infall (i.e. when molecular transition shows evidence of gas flowing into the core of the star).

Token money,"Token money, or token, is a form of money that has a lesser intrinsic value compared to its face value. Token money is anything that is accepted as money, not due to its intrinsic value but instead because of custom or legal enactment. Token money costs less to produce than its face value. A banknote, e.g. a five-pound note, is token money because despite its value being 5 pounds it only costs significantly less to produce. A gold coin is not considered token money. The Token money system has been adopted in many businesses around the world as an effective way to exchange value between companies and customers. Token money as a system is predominantly used in mobile games, but is also used in the realm of e-commerce. Token money is similar to fiat money which also has little intrinsic value, however they differ in that token money is a limited legal tender. The adoption of token money has improved transaction efficiency, as the practicalty of transacting with sums of gold poses a larger security risk. In a commodity economy, money is a measure of the value of goods and services (prices) within a sovereign country or the same economy, as well as a particular commodity to pay off debts. The token is also used as a medium of exchange, as a store of value, and as a unit of account. Digital currencies using decentralized blockchain technology are also a form of token money.


== History ==
In Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, copper coins were used for small transactions and were issued a monetary value greater than the value of the metal itself. This established the principle of token money, which is the nature of coinage in contemporary society. Plato distinguished between tokens and commodities. In Medieval Indian History, Mohammad Bin Tughlaq (c.1290-1351) issued copper currency called Tanka as token money whose value was legally set equal to silver coin, and is considered the world's first truly token currency.
In the early nineteenth century, David Ricardo suggested issuing token money as long as it did not affect commodity standard.


=== Physical tokens ===

Token money has less intrinsic value compared to its face value. If the token money is metallic it is commonly made out of cheaper metals such as copper and nickel.
Token money is also money whose face value exceeds its cost of production, i.e. the intrinsic value is lower than the extrinsic value. This means that the actual worth of a note or coin is much less than what we use it for. The cost of production of token money is less than its actual value, for example with convertible currency, collector notes, souvenirs, coupons, some retired US banknotes and per 1986 banknotes printed in regulation size and only on one side with authorization are actually worth more dollars than when issued.
With token money, exchanges are not considered fully complete because the exchange of value is not equivalent.  Value is hoped to be rendered at some future time.  Examples of this include bills of exchange or negotiable instrument and certificates.
Token money does not have free coinage.

Apophatic theology,"Apophatic theology, also known as negative theology, is a form of theological thinking and religious practice which attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God. It forms a pair together with cataphatic theology, which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God is.
The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception.


== Etymology and definition ==
""Apophatic"", Ancient Greek: ἀπόφασις (noun); from ἀπόφημι apophēmi, meaning 'to deny'. From Online Etymology Dictionary: 

apophatic (adj.) ""involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation"", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek apophatikos, from apophasis ""denial, negation"", from apophanai ""to speak off,"" from apo ""off, away from"" (see apo-) + phanai ""to speak,"" related to pheme ""voice,"" from PIE root *bha- (2) ""to speak, tell, say.""
Via negativa or via negationis (Latin), 'negative way' or 'by way of denial'. The negative way forms a pair together with the kataphatic or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,

Pseudo Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the ""way of speech"": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say ""God is Love"", ""God is Beauty"", ""God is Good"". 
The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both ""ways"" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.


== Origins and development ==
According to Fagenblat, ""negative theology is as old as philosophy itself:"" elements of it can be found in Plato's unwritten doctrines, while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in Philo of Alexandria.
According to Carabine, ""apophasis proper"" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus. Carabine writes that there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.
The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo, and Meredith even states that Philo ""is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."" Yet, it was with Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Maximus the Confessor, whose writings shaped both Hesychasm (the contemplative monastic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches) and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.
Elijah's hearing of a ""still, small voice"" at 1 Kings 19:11-13 has been proposed as a Biblical example of apophatic prayer.


== Greek philosophy ==


=== Pre-Socratic ===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship. Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained. Epiphany played an essential role in attaining this knowledge. Xenophanes (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.
According to Herodotus (484–425 BC), Homer and Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods. The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his Theogony the birth of the gods and creation of the world, which became an ""ur-text for programmatic, first-person epiphanic narratives in Greek literature,"" but also ""explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."" According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods ""actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought.""
Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem On Nature, gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. ""The way of conviction"" explores Being, true reality (""what-is""), which is ""What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."" ""The way of opinion"" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's allegory of the Cave. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God. Cook notes that Parmenides' poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the mystery cults, giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook. Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to ""attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom.""


=== Plato ===

Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC), ""deciding for Parmenides against Heraclitus"" and his theory of eternal change, had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.
Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue Parmenides, which is a treatment of the eternal forms, Truth, Beauty and Goodness, which are the real aims for knowledge. The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem of how one fundamental reality or unchanging essence can admit of many changing phenomena, other than by dismissing them as being mere illusion.
In The Republic, Plato argues that the ""real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"" stating that the Form of the Good is the highest object of knowledge. His argument culminates in the Allegory of the Cave, in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the Form of the Good. Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the ""first principles of all knowledge.""
According to Cook, the Theory of Forms has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus. The pursuit of Truth, Beauty and Goodness became a central element in the apophatic tradition, but nevertheless, according to Carabine ""Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."" Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with ""one transcendent source,"" an identification which his later interpreters made.


=== Middle Platonism ===

Middle Platonism (1st century BC–3rd century AD) further investigated Plato's ""Unwritten Doctrines,"" which drew on Pythagoras' first principles of the Monad and the Dyad (matter). Middle Platonism proposed a hierarchy of being, with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's Form of the Good. An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was Philo (c. 25 BC–c. 50 AD), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity. According to Craig D. Allert, ""Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."" For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.


=== Neo-Platonism ===

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which ""developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."" It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270 AD), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 AD, when the pagan traditions were ousted. It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to Gnosticism. Proclus of Athens (*412–485 C.E.)  played a crucial role in the transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages., serving as head or ‘successor’ (diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic ‘Academy’ for over 50 years. His student Pseudo-Dionysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.


==== Plotinus ====

Plotinus (204/5–270 AD) was the founder of Neo-Platonism. In the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute. For Plotinus, the One is the first principle, from which everything else emanates. He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the Republic, as the cause of the other Forms, with the One of the first hypothesis of the second part of the Parmenides. For Plotinus, the One precedes the Forms, and ""is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."" From the One comes the Intellect, which contains all the Forms. The One is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such. Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to itself. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of the One, which unites all existents ""as a single, all-pervasive reality.""
The One is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity. Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the ""presence of the intellect in the human soul,"" initiating an ascent of the soul by abstraction or ""taking away,"" culminating in a sudden appearance of the One. In the Enneads Plotinus writes: 

Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.
Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of the One, but a means to ecstasis and an ascent to ""the unapproachable light that is God."" Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching henosis, concludes that ""Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."" According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the ""non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul,"" by ""calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."" Pao-Shen Ho further notes that ""for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."" The argumentation about henosis is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when henosis has been attained. Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to ""bring his own soul and the souls of others by way of Intellect to union with the One."" As such, the Enneads as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to The Cloud of Unknowing, demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry. Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.


==== Proclus ====
Proclus (412–485) introduced the terminology used in apophatic and cataphatic theology. He did this in the second book of his Platonic Theology, arguing that Plato states that the One can be revealed ""through analogy,"" and that ""through negations [dia ton apophaseon] its transcendence over everything can be shown."" For Proclus, apophatic and cataphatic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from the One, and cataphatic theology corresponding to the return to the One. The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward the One, while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to the One. According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that ""Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single ineffable Name of God (יהוה‎) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle.""


== Christianity ==


=== Apostolic Age ===
The Book of Revelation 8:1 mentions ""the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven."" According to Dan Merkur:

The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term ""silence"" also alludes to the ""still small voice"" (1 Kings 19:12) whose revelation to Elijah on Mount Horeb rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.


=== Early Church Fathers ===
The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo (c. 25 BC – 50 AD), who saw Moses as ""the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the 'luminous darkness' of God."" His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.
God's appearance to Moses in the burning bush was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers, especially Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 – 395), realizing the fundamental unknowability of God; an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition. Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since ""following Christ is the human way of seeing God.""
Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology. Clement holds that God is unknowable, although God's unknowability, concerns only his essence, not his energies, or powers. According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term theoria develops further from a mere intellectual ""seeing"" toward a spiritual form of contemplation. Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of theoria and the ""mystic vision of the soul."" For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent. According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven not by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition. His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective. According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach. Theoria and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.
According to Tertullian (c. 155–c. 240):

[T]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions – our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is. He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.
Saint Cyril of Jerusalem (313–386), in his Catechetical Homilies, states:

For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him. For in what concerns God to confess our ignorance is the best knowledge.

Augustine of Hippo (354–430) defined God aliud, aliud valde, meaning 'other, completely other', in Confessions 7.10.16, wrote Si [enim] comprehendis, non est Deus, meaning 'if you understand [something], it is not God', in Sermo 117.3.5 (PL 38, 663), and a famous legend tells that, while walking along the Mediterranean shoreline meditating on the mystery of the Trinity, he met a child who with a seashell (or a little pail) was trying to pour the whole sea into a small hole dug in the sand. Augustine told him that it was impossible to enclose the immensity of the sea in such a small opening, and the child replied that it was equally impossible to try to understand the infinity of God within the limited confines of the human mind.


=== The Chalcedonian Christological dogma ===

The Christological dogma, formulated by the Fourth Ecumenical Council held in Chalcedon in 451, is based on dyophysitism and hypostatic union, concepts used to describe the union of humanity and divinity in a single hypostasis, or individual existence, that of Jesus Christ. This remains transcendent to mankind's rational categories, a mystery which has to be guarded by apophatic language, as it is a personal union of a singularly unique kind.


=== Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite ===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of Proclus (412–485) who combined a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas. He is a constant factor in the contemplative tradition of the eastern Orthodox Churches, and from the 9th century onwards his writings also had a strong impact on western mysticism.
Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from Acts of the Apostles chapter 17, in which Paul gives a missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus in Athens. In Acts 17:23 Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the Unknown God, ""a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."" For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity. Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term ""unknown God"" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the ""unknown God.""
According to Corrigan and Harrington, ""Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God [...] who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."" Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described human ascent to divinity as a process of purgation, illumination and union. Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.


=== Eastern Orthodox Christianity ===

In Orthodox Christianity, apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century Cappadocian Fathers stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator transcends this existence, is uncreated. The essence of God is completely unknowable; mankind can acquire an incomplete knowledge of God in his attributes (propria), positive and negative, by reflecting upon and participating in his self-revelatory operations (energeiai). Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335–c. 395), John Chrysostom (c. 349–407), and Basil the Great (329–379) emphasized the importance of negative theology to an orthodox understanding of God. John of Damascus (c. 675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal ""not the nature, but the things around the nature.""
Maximus the Confessor (580–622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Gregory Palamas (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of Hesychasm, the Eastern Orthodox practices of contemplative prayer and theosis, ""deification.""
Influential 20th-century Orthodox theologians include the Neo-Palamist writers Vladimir Lossky, John Meyendorff, John S. Romanides, and Georges Florovsky. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology, which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation. This is expressed in the idea that mysticism is the expression of dogmatic theology par excellence.
According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through Scripture and Sacred Tradition, such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in his essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even angels) can understand. He is transcendent in essence (ousia). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or his indestructible energies through theoria (vision of God). According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is immanent in his hypostasis or existences.


=== Western Christianity ===

Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian John Scotus Erigena wrote:

We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., ""not any created thing""]. Literally God is not, because He transcends being.
When he says ""He is not anything"" and ""God is not"", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is ""other"".
Theologians like Meister Eckhart and John of the Cross exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, The Cloud of Unknowing and John of the Cross' Dark Night of the Soul are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the Catholic Church, which, on the basis of Scripture and church tradition, during the Fourth Lateran Council formulated the following dogma:

Between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater dissimilitude.


==== The via eminentiae ====

Thomas Aquinas was born ten years later (1225–1274) and, although in his Summa Theologiae he quotes Pseudo-Dionysius 1,760 times, stating that ""Now, because we cannot know what God is, but rather what He is not, we have no means for considering how God is, but rather how He is not"" and leaving the work unfinished because it was like ""straw"" compared to what had been revealed to him, his reading in a neo-Aristotelian key of the conciliar declaration overthrew its meaning inaugurating the ""analogical way"" as tertium between via negativa and via positiva: the via eminentiae. In this way, the believers see what attributes are common between them and God, as well as the unique, not human, properly divine and not understandable way in respect of which God possesses that attributes.
According to Adrian Langdon:

The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the via positiva, via negativa, and via eminentiae. In Thomas Aquinas, for example, the via positiva undergirds the discussion of univocity, the via negativa the equivocal, and the via eminentiae the final defense of analogy.
According to Catholic Encyclopedia, the Doctor Angelicus and the scholastici declare that:

God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an ""analogical way"". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (equivoce) but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (univoce), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (eminenter) which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.
Since then Thomism has played a decisive role in resizing the negative or apophatic tradition of the magisterium.


=== 20th century ===

Apophatic statements are still crucial to many modern theologians, restarting in the 1800s by Søren Kierkegaard (see his concept of the infinite qualitative distinction) up to Rudolf Otto, Karl Barth (see their idea of ""Wholly Other"", i.e. ganz Andere or totaliter aliter), the Ludwig Wittgenstein of the Tractatus, and Martin Heidegger after his Kehre.
C. S. Lewis, in his book Miracles (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse one's mind of misconceptions. He goes on to advocate refilling the mind with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad analogies or false mind-pictures.
The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd, who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding the impossibility of absolutely knowing God, and yet the possibility of truly knowing something of God.  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. He argues that most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, which involves reflection and attempts to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, for Dooyeweerd, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, exhibits a diverse range of aspects, and can grasp at least the law side. According to Dooyeweerd, knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature. The philosopher Leo Strauss considered that the Bible, for example, should be treated as pre-theoretical (everyday) rather than theoretical in what it contains.
Ivan Illich (1926–2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called ""Why Philia?""


=== 21st century ===
Karen Armstrong, in her book The Case for God (2009), notices a recovery of apophatic theology in postmodern theology.
Philosopher and literary scholar William Franke, particularly in his 2007 two-volume collection On What Cannot Be Said and his 2014 monograph A Philosophy of the Unsayable, puts forth that negative theology's exploration and performance of language's limitations is not simply one current among many in religious thought, but is ""a kind of perennial counter-philosophy to the philosophy of Logos"" that persistently challenges central tenets of Western thought throughout its history. For Franke, literature demonstrates the ""infinitely open"" nature of language which negative theology and related forms of philosophical thought seek to draw attention to. Franke therefore argues that literature, philosophy, and theology begin to bleed into one another as they approach what he frames as the ""apophatic"" side of Western thought.


== Islam ==

Various traditions and schools in Islam (see Islamic schools and branches) draw on sundry theologies in approaching God in Islam (Allah, Arabic الله) or the ultimate reality. ""Negative theology"" involves the use of تَعْطِيل, ta'tīl, defined as 'setting aside', 'canceling out', 'negation', or 'nullification'. The followers of the Mu'tazili school of Kalam, the spread of which is often attributed to Wasil ibn Ata, are often called the Mu'aṭṭilah ('cancelers' or 'negators'), a description, sometimes employed derogatorily, deriving from the school's descriptions of the Islamic God.
Rajab ʿAlī Tabrīzī, an Iranian and Shi'ite philosopher and mystic of the 17th century, is credited with instilling an apophatic theology in a generation of philosophers and theologians whose influence extended into the Qajar period. Mulla Rajab affirmed the completely unknowable,
unqualifiable, and attributeless nature of God and upheld a general view concerning God's attributes which can only be negatively 'affirmed' (that is, by affirmingly negating all that is not God about God).
Shia Islam largely adopts ""negative theology"". In the words of the Persian Ismaili missionary, Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani: ""There does not exist a tanzíh [""transcendence""] more brilliant and more splendid than that by which we establish the absolute transcendence of our Originator through the use of these phrases in which a negative and a negative of a negative apply to the thing denied.""
Literalists completely reject and condemn any negation that would clash with the wording of the Islamic Scriptures or with the narratives ascribed to the Islamic Prophet. They therefore hold that descriptors and qualifiers that occur in the Qur'ān and in the canonized religious traditions, even if seeming or sounding humanlike such as ""hand"", ""finger, or ""foot"", are to be wholly affirmed as attributes of God (not limbs).
Many Sunnites, like the Ash'aris and Maturidis, adhere to some middle path or synthesis between negation and anthropomorphism, though the kind of each combination of negation and affirmation varies greatly.


== Judaism ==

Maimonides (1135/1138–1204) was ""the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the via negativa."" Maimonides – along with Samuel ibn Tibbon – draws on Bahya ibn Paquda, who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of his absolute unity. God, as the entity which is ""truly One"" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and indescribable. In The Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides states:

God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive attribute [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living — it is not dead; [...] it is the first — its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will — it is not feeble or ignorant; He is One — there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself — and not of His actions — the negation of the opposite.
According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that ""[God] is knowledge,"" and saw his essence, being, and knowledge as completely one, ""a perfect unity and not a composite at all."" Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating:

This [form of unity] wherein G‑d's knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.
According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought. Yeshayahu Leibowitz (1903–1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology. According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is their commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person's image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.


=== Jacques Derrida ===
The work of Jewish philosopher Jacques Derrida, and in particular his critical method called deconstruction, has frequently been comp",1
Inerting (gas),"In fire and explosion prevention engineering, inerting refers to the introduction of an inert (non-combustible) gas into a closed system (e.g. a container or a process vessel) to make a flammable atmosphere oxygen deficient and non-ignitable.
Inerting relies on the principle that a combustible (or flammable) gas is able to undergo combustion (explode) only if mixed with air in the right proportions. The flammability limits of the gas define those proportions, i.e. the ignitable range.  In combustion engineering terms, the admission of inert gas can be said to dilute the oxygen below the limiting oxygen concentration.
Inerting differs from purging.  Purging, by definition, ensures that an ignitable mixture never forms.  Inerting makes an ignitable mixture safe by introduction of an inert gas.


== Certain inert gases are unsuitable for inerting ==
Because the mixture by definition is ignitable before inerting commence, it is imperative that the inerting procedure does not introduce a potential source of ignition, or an explosion will occur.
NFPA 77 states that carbon dioxide from high-pressure cylinders or fire extinguishers should never be used to inert a container or vessel.  The release of carbon dioxide may generate static electricity with enough energy to ignite the mixture, resulting in an explosion.  The release of CO2 for fire fighting purposes has led to several accidental explosions of which the 1954 Bitburg explosion may be the most devastating.
Other unsafe processes that may generate static electricity include pneumatic transport of solids, a release of pressurized gas with solids, industrial vacuum cleaners, and spray painting operations.


== Other uses ==
The term inerting is often loosely used for any application involving an inert gas, not conforming  with the technical definitions in NFPA standards.  For example, marine tankers carrying low-flash products like crude oil, naphtha, or gasoline have inerting systems on board.  During the voyage, the vapor pressure of these liquids is so high, that the atmosphere above the liquid (the headspace) is too rich to burn, the atmosphere is unignitable.  This may change during unloading.  When a certain volume of liquid is drawn from a tank, a similar volume of air will enter the  tank's headspace, potentially creating an ignitable atmosphere.
The inerting systems use an inert gas generator to supply inert make-up gas instead of air.  This procedure is often referred to as inerting. Technically, the procedure ensures that the atmosphere in the tank's headspace remains unignitable.  The gas mixture in the headspace is not inert per se, it's just unignitable.  Because of its content of flammable vapors, it will burn if mixed with air.  Only if enough inert gas is supplied as part of a purge-out-of-service procedure, will it be unable to burn when mixed with air.

Cosmological argument,"The cosmological argument is an attempt to prove the existence of God by the fact that things exist. It assumes that things must have a cause, and that the chain of causes can only end by a supernatural event. Other names for the argument are argument from universal causation,  argument from first cause, causal argument and argument from existence. 
The universe exists, so there must be something that caused the universe.  The first cause is claimed to be God. Thomas Aquinas said that God is the only thing that was not caused by something else, and that God created the cause of existence. The idea has been popular with many theologians and philosophers.

Snowmelt,"Snowmelt is water from snow that melts.  There is a lot of snowmelt in the spring. Snowmelt can cause floods.


== Pollution ==
Snowmelt can also affect how good and safe drinking water is.  Snowflakes collect air pollution as they fall.  Snow on the ground collects pollution from cars, farm animals, fertilizer, and other things.  The snowmelt collects dirt and other pollutants on the ground.  Pollution in snowmelt can be a larger problem than pollution in rainwater because the snow collects pollution all winter and then the snowmelt combines with the spring rain and releases it all at the same time.  Then it flows into streams and reservoirs where human beings get their drinking water.

Black carbon,"Black carbon (BC) is the light-absorbing refractory form of elemental carbon remaining after pyrolysis (e.g., charcoal) or produced by incomplete combustion (e.g., soot). 
Tihomir Novakov originated the term black carbon in the 1970s, after identifying black carbon as fine particulate matter (PM ≤ 2.5 μm aerodynamic diameter) in aerosols. Aerosol black carbon occurs in several linked forms. Formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass, black carbon is one of the main types of soot particle in both anthropogenic and naturally occurring soot. As soot, black carbon causes disease and premature death. Because of these human health impacts, many countries have worked to reduce their emissions, making it an easy pollutant to abate in anthropogenic sources.
In climatology, aerosol black carbon is a climate forcing agent contributing to global warming. Black carbon warms the Earth by absorbing sunlight and heating the atmosphere and by reducing albedo when deposited on snow and ice (direct effects) and indirectly by interaction with clouds, with the total forcing of 1.1 W/m2. Black carbon stays in the atmosphere for only several days to weeks. In contrast, potent greenhouse gases have longer lifecycles. For example, carbon dioxide (CO2) has an atmospheric lifetime of more than 100 years. The IPCC and other climate researchers have posited that reducing black carbon is one of the easiest ways to slow down short term global warming.
The term black carbon is also used in soil science and geology, referring to deposited atmospheric black carbon or directly incorporated black carbon from vegetation fires. Especially in the tropics, black carbon in soils significantly contributes to fertility as it can absorb important plant nutrients.
In climatology, biochar carbon removal sequesters atmospheric carbon as black carbon to slow global warming.


== Overview ==

Michael Faraday recognized that soot was composed of carbon and that it was produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels. The term black carbon was coined by Serbian physicist Tihomir Novakov, referred to as ""the godfather of black carbon studies"" by James Hansen, in the 1970s. Smoke or soot was the first pollutant to be recognized as having significant environmental impact yet one of the last to be studied by the contemporary atmospheric research community.
Soot is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds which are weakly absorbing in the visible spectral region and a highly absorbing black component which is variously called ""elemental"", ""graphitic"" or ""black carbon"". The term elemental carbon has been used in conjunction with thermal and wet chemical determinations and the term graphitic carbon suggests the presence of graphite-like micro-crystalline structures in soot as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy. The term black carbon is used to imply that this soot component is primarily responsible for the absorption of visible light. The term black carbon is sometimes used as a synonym for both the elemental and graphitic component of soot. It can be measured using different types of devices based on absorption or dispersion of a light beam or derived from noise measurements.


=== Early mitigation attempts ===
The disastrous effects of coal pollution on human health and mortality in the early 1950s in London led to the UK Clean Air Act 1956. This act led to dramatic reductions of soot concentrations in the United Kingdom which were followed by similar reductions in US cities like Pittsburgh and St. Louis. These reductions were largely achieved by the decreased use of soft coal for domestic heating by switching either to ""smokeless"" coals or other forms of fuel, such as fuel oil and natural gas. The steady reduction of smoke pollution in the industrial cities of Europe and United States caused a shift in research emphasis away from soot emissions and the almost complete neglect of black carbon as a significant aerosol constituent, at least in the United States.
In the 1970s, however, a series of studies substantially changed this picture and demonstrated that black carbon as well as the organic soot components continued to be a large component in urban aerosols across the United States and Europe which led to improved controls of these emissions. In the less-developed regions of the world where there were limited or no controls on soot emissions the air quality continued to degrade as the population increased. It was not generally realized until many years later that from the perspective of global effects the emissions from these regions were extremely important.


=== Influence on Earth's atmosphere ===
Most of the developments mentioned above relate to air quality in urban atmospheres. The first indications of the role of black carbon in a larger, global context came from studies of the Arctic Haze phenomena. Black carbon was identified in the Arctic haze aerosols and in the Arctic snow.
In general, aerosol particles can affect the radiation balance leading to a cooling or heating effect with the magnitude and sign of the temperature change largely dependent on aerosol optical properties, aerosol concentrations, and the albedo of the underlying surface. A purely scattering aerosol will reflect energy that would normally be absorbed by the earth-atmosphere system back to space and leads to a cooling effect. As one adds an absorbing component to the aerosol, it can lead to a heating of the earth-atmosphere system if the reflectivity of the underlying surface is sufficiently high.
Early studies of the effects of aerosols on atmospheric radiative transfer on a global scale assumed a dominantly scattering aerosol with only a small absorbing component, since this appears to be a good representation of naturally occurring aerosols. However, as discussed above, urban aerosols have a large black carbon component and if these particles can be transported on a global scale then one would expect a heating effect over surfaces with a high surface albedo like snow or ice. Furthermore, if these particles are deposited in the snow an additional heating effect would occur due to reductions in the surface albedo.


=== Measuring and modeling spatial distribution ===
Levels of black carbon are most often determined based on the modification of the optical properties of a fiber filter by deposited particles. Either filter transmittance, filter reflectance or a combination of transmittance and reflectance is measured. Aethalometers are frequently used devices that optically detect the changing absorption of light transmitted through a filter ticket. The USEPA Environmental Technology Verification program evaluated both the aethalometer and also the Sunset Laboratory thermal-optical analyzer. A multiangle absorption photometer takes into account both transmitted and reflected light. Alternative methods rely on satellite based measurements of optical depth for large areas or more recently on spectral noise analysis for very local concentrations.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s surprisingly large ground level concentrations of black carbon were observed throughout the western Arctic. Modeling studies indicated that they could lead to heating over polar ice. One of the major uncertainties in modeling the effects of the Arctic haze on the solar radiation balance was limited knowledge of the vertical distributions of black carbon.
During 1983 and 1984 as part of the NOAA AGASP program, the first measurements of such distributions in the Arctic atmosphere were obtained with an aethalometer which had the capability of measuring black carbon on a real-time basis. These measurements showed substantial concentrations of black carbon found throughout the western Arctic troposphere including the North Pole. The vertical profiles showed either a strongly layered structure or an almost uniform distribution up to eight kilometers with concentrations within layers as large as those found at ground level in typical mid-latitude urban areas in the United States. The absorption optical depths associated with these vertical profiles were large as evidenced by a vertical profile over the Norwegian arctic where absorption optical depths of 0.023 to 0.052 were calculated respectively for external and internal mixtures of black carbon with the other aerosol components.
Optical depths of these magnitudes lead to a substantial change in the solar radiation balance over the highly reflecting Arctic snow surface during the March–April time frame of these measurements modeled the Arctic aerosol for an absorption optical depth of 0.021 (which is close to the average of an internal and external mixtures for the AGASP flights), under cloud-free conditions. These heating effects were viewed at the time as potentially one of the major causes of Arctic warming trends as described in Archives of Dept. of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Accomplishments.


=== Presence in soils ===
Typically, black carbon accounts for 1 to 6%, and up to 60% of the total organic carbon stored in soils is contributed by black carbon. Especially for tropical soils black carbon serves as a reservoir for nutrients. Experiments showed that soils without high amounts of black carbon are significantly less fertile than soils that contain black carbon. An example of this increased soil fertility is the Terra preta soils of central Amazonia, presumably human-made by pre-Columbian native populations. Terra preta soils have, on average, three times higher soil organic matter (SOM) content, higher nutrient levels, and a better nutrient retention capacity than surrounding infertile soils. In this context, the slash and burn agricultural practice used in tropical regions does not only enhance productivity by releasing nutrients from the burned vegetation but also by adding black carbon to the soil. Nonetheless, for sustainable management, a slash-and-char practice would be better to prevent high emissions of CO2 and volatile black carbon. Furthermore, the positive effects of this type of agriculture are counteracted if used for large patches so that the vegetation does not prevent soil erosion.


=== Presence in waters ===
Soluble and colloidal black carbon retained on the landscape from wildfires can make its way to groundwater. On a global scale, the flow of black carbon into fresh and salt water bodies approximates the rate of wildfire black carbon production.


== Emission sources ==


=== By region ===

Developed countries were once the primary source of black carbon emissions, but this began to change in the 1950s with the adoption of pollution control technologies in those countries. Whereas the United States emits about 21% of the world's CO2, it emits 6.1% of the world's soot. The European Union and United States might further reduce their black carbon emissions by accelerating implementation of black carbon regulations that currently take effect in 2015 or 2020 and by supporting the adoption of pending International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations. Existing regulations also could be expanded to increase the use of clean diesel and clean coal technologies and to develop second-generation technologies.
Today, the majority of black carbon emissions are from developing countries and this trend is expected to increase. The largest sources of black carbon are Asia, Latin America, and Africa. China and India together account for 25–35% of global black carbon emissions. Black carbon emissions from China doubled from 2000 to 2006. Existing and well-tested technologies used by developed countries, such as clean diesel and clean coal, could be transferred to developing countries to reduce their emissions.
Black carbon emissions are highest in and around major source regions. This results in regional hotspots of atmospheric solar heating due to black carbon. Hotspot areas include:

the Indo-Gangetic plains of India
eastern China
most of Southeast Asia and Indonesia
equatorial regions of Africa
Mexico and Central America
most of Brazil and Peru in South America.
Approximately three billion people live in these hotspots.


=== By source ===

Approximately 20% of black carbon is emitted from burning biofuels, 40% from fossil fuels, and 40% from open biomass burning. Similar estimates of the sources of black carbon emissions are as follows:

42% Open biomass burning. (forest and savanna burning)
18%	Residential biomass burned with traditional technologies.
14%	Diesel engines for transportation.
10%	Diesel engines for industrial use.
10% 	Industrial processes and power generation, usually from smaller boilers.
6%	Residential coal burned with traditional technologies.
Black carbon sources vary by region. For example, the majority of soot emissions in South Asia are due to biomass cooking, whereas in East Asia, coal combustion for residential and industrial uses plays a larger role. In Western Europe, traffic seems to be the most important source since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to (motorized) traffic.
Fossil fuel and biomass soot have significantly greater amounts of black carbon than climate-cooling aerosols and particulate matter, making reductions of these sources particularly powerful mitigation strategies. For example, emissions from the diesel engines and marine vessels contain higher levels of black carbon compared to other sources. Regulating black carbon emissions from diesel engines and marine vessels therefore presents a significant opportunity to reduce black carbon's global warming impact.
Biomass burning emits greater amounts of climate-cooling aerosols and particulate matter than black carbon, resulting in short-term cooling. However, over the long-term, biomass burning may cause a net warming when CO2 emissions and deforestation are considered. Reducing biomass emissions would therefore reduce global warming in the long-term and provide co-benefits of reduced air pollution, CO2 emissions, and deforestation. It has been estimated that by switching to slash-and-char from slash-and-burn agriculture, which turns biomass into ash using open fires that release black carbon and GHGs, 12% of anthropogenic carbon emissions caused by land use change could be reduced annually, which is approximately 0.66 Gt CO2-eq. per year, or 2% of all annual global CO2-eq emissions.
In a research study published in June 2022, atmospheric scientist Christopher Maloney and his colleagues noted that rocket launches release tiny particles called aerosols in the stratosphere and increase ozone layer loss. They used a climate model to determine the impact of the black carbon coming out of the rocket's engine nozzle. Using various scenarios of growing number of rocket launches, they found that each year, rocket launches could expel 1–10 gigagrams of black carbon at the lower end to 30–100 gigagrams at the extreme end in next few decades. In another study published in June 2022, researchers used a 3D model to study the impact of rocket launches and reentry. They determined that the black carbon particles emitted by the rockets results in an enhanced warming effect of almost 500 times more than other sources.


== Impacts ==
Black carbon is a form of ultrafine particulate matter, which when released in the air causes premature human mortality and disability. In addition, atmospheric black carbon changes the radiative energy balance of the climate system in a way that raises air and surface temperatures, causing a variety of detrimental environmental impacts on humans, on agriculture, and on plant and animal ecosystems.


=== Public health impacts ===
Particulate matter is the most harmful to public health of all air pollutants in Europe. Black carbon particulate matter contains very fine carcinogens and is therefore particularly harmful.
It is estimated that from 640,000 to 4,900,000 premature human deaths could be prevented every year by using available mitigation measures to reduce black carbon in the atmosphere.
Humans are exposed to black carbon by inhalation of air in the immediate vicinity of local sources. Important indoor sources include candles and biomass burning whereas traffic and occasionally forest fires are the major outdoor sources of black carbon exposure. Concentrations of black carbon decrease sharply with increasing distance from (traffic) sources which makes it an atypical component of particulate matter. This makes it difficult to estimate exposure of populations. For particulate matter, epidemiological studies have traditionally relied on single fixed site measurements or inferred residential concentrations. Recent studies have shown that as much black carbon is inhaled in traffic and at other locations as at the home address. 
Despite the fact that a large portion of the exposure occurs as short peaks of high concentrations, it is unclear how to define peaks and determine their frequency and health impact.
High peak concentrations are encountered during car driving. High in-vehicle concentrations of black carbon have been associated with driving during rush hours, on highways and in dense traffic.
Even relatively low exposure concentrations of black carbon have a direct effect on the lung function of adults and an inflammatory effect on the respiratory system of children.
A recent study found no effect of black carbon on blood pressure when combined with physical activity.
The public health benefits of reduction in the amount of soot and other particulate matter has been recognized for years. However, high concentrations persist in industrializing areas in Asia and in urban areas in the West such as Chicago. The WHO estimates that air pollution causes nearly two million premature deaths per year. By reducing black carbon, a primary component of fine particulate matter, the health risks from air pollution will decline. In fact, public health concerns have given rise to leading to many efforts to reduce such emissions, for example, from diesel vehicles and cooking stoves.


=== Climate impacts ===
Direct effect Black carbon particles directly absorb sunlight and reduce the planetary albedo when suspended in the atmosphere.
Semi-direct effect Black carbon absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. They may either increase or decrease cloud cover under different conditions.
Snow/ice albedo effect When deposited on high albedo surfaces like ice and snow, black carbon particles reduce the total surface albedo available to reflect solar energy back into space. Small initial snow albedo reduction may have a large forcing because of a positive feedback: Reduced snow albedo would increase surface temperature. The increased surface temperature would decrease the snow cover and further decrease surface albedo.
Indirect effect Black carbon may also indirectly cause changes in the absorption or reflection of solar radiation through changes in the properties and behavior of clouds. Research scheduled for publication in 2013 shows black carbon plays a role second only to carbon dioxide in climate change. Effects are complex, resulting from a variety of factors, but due to the short life of black carbon in the atmosphere, about a week as compared to carbon dioxide which last centuries, control of black carbon offers possible opportunities for slowing, or even reversing, climate warming.


==== Radiative forcing ====
Estimates of black carbon's globally averaged direct radiative forcing vary from the IPCC's estimate of + 0.34 watts per square meter (W/m2) ± 0.25, to a more recent estimate by V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael of 0.9 W/m2.
The IPCC also estimated the globally averaged snow albedo effect of black carbon at +0.1 ± 0.1 W/m2.
Based on the IPCC estimate, it would be reasonable to conclude that the combined direct and indirect snow albedo effects for black carbon rank it as the third largest contributor to globally averaged positive radiative forcing since the pre-industrial period. In comparison, the more recent direct radiative forcing estimate by Ramanathan and Carmichael would lead one to conclude that black carbon has contributed the second largest globally averaged radiative forcing after carbon dioxide (CO2), and that the radiative forcing of black carbon is ""as much as 55% of the CO2 forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) such as CH4, CFCs, N2O, or tropospheric ozone.""
Table 1: Estimates of Black Carbon Radiative Forcing, by Effect

Table 2: Estimated Climate Forcings (W/m2)


==== Effects on Arctic ice and Himalayan glaciers ====
According to the IPCC, ""the presence of black carbon over highly reflective surfaces, such as snow and ice, or clouds, may cause a significant positive radiative forcing"". The IPCC also notes that emissions from biomass burning, which usually have a negative forcing, have a positive forcing over snow fields in areas such as the Himalayas. A 2013 study quantified that gas flares contributed over 40% of the black carbon deposited in the Arctic.
According to Charles Zender, black carbon is a significant contributor to Arctic ice-melt, and reducing such emissions may be ""the most efficient way to mitigate Arctic warming that we know of"". The ""climate forcing due to snow/ice albedo change is of the order of 1.0 W/m2 at middle- and high-latitude land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and over the Arctic Ocean."" The ""soot effect on snow albedo may be responsible for a quarter of observed global warming"". ""Soot deposition increases surface melt on ice masses, and the meltwater spurs multiple radiative and dynamical feedback processes that accelerate ice disintegration,"" according to NASA scientists James Hansen and Larissa Nazarenko. As a result of this feedback process, ""BC on snow warms the planet about three times more than an equal forcing of CO2."" When black carbon concentrations in the Arctic increase during the winter and spring due to Arctic Haze, surface temperatures increase by 0.5 °C. Black carbon emissions also significantly contribute to Arctic ice-melt, which is critical because ""nothing in climate is more aptly described as a 'tipping point' than the 0 °C boundary that separates frozen from liquid water—the bright, reflective snow and ice from the dark, heat-absorbing ocean.""
Black carbon emissions from northern Eurasia, North America, and Asia have the greatest absolute impact on Arctic warming. However, black carbon emissions actually occurring within the Arctic have a disproportionately larger impact per particle on Arctic warming than emissions originating elsewhere. As Arctic ice melts and shipping activity increases, emissions originating within the Arctic are expected to rise.
In some regions, such as the Himalayas, the impact of black carbon on melting snowpack and glaciers may be equal to that of CO2. Warmer air resulting from the presence of black carbon in South and East Asia over the Himalayas contributes to a warming of approximately 0.6 °C. An ""analysis of temperature trends on the Tibetan side of the Himalayas reveals warming in excess of 1 °C."" A summer aerosol sampling on a glacier saddle of Mt. Everest (Qomolangma) in 2003 showed industrially induced sulfate from South Asia may cross over the highly elevated Himalaya. This indicated BC in South Asia could also have the same transport mode. And such kind of signal might have been detected in at a black carbon monitoring site in the hinterland of Tibet. Snow sampling and measurement suggested black carbon deposited in some Himalayan glaciers may reduce the surface albedo by 0.01–0.02. Black carbon record based on a shallow ice core drilled from the East Rongbuk glacier showed a dramatic increasing trend of black carbon concentrations in the ice stratigraphy since the 1990s, and simulated average radiative forcing caused by black carbon was nearly 2 W/m2 in 2002. This large warming trend is the proposed causal factor for the accelerating retreat of Himalayan glaciers, which threatens fresh water supplies and food security in China and India. A general darkening trend in the mid-Himalaya glaciers revealed by MODIS data since 2000 could be partially attributed to black carbon and light absorbing impurities like dust in the springtime, which was later extended to the whole Hindu Kush-Kararoram-Himalaya glaciers research finding a widespread darkening trend of -0.001 yr−1 over the period of 2000–2011. The most rapid decrease in albedo (more negative than -0.0015 yr−1) occurred in the altitudes over 5500 m above sea level.


=== Global warming ===
In its 2007 report, the IPCC estimated for the first time the direct radiative forcing of black carbon from fossil fuel emissions at + 0.2 W/m2, and the radiative forcing of black carbon through its effect on the surface albedo of snow and ice at an additional + 0.1 W/m2. More recent studies and public testimony by many of the same scientists cited in the IPCC's report estimate that emissions from black carbon are the second-largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide emissions, and that reducing these emissions may be the fastest strategy for slowing climate change.
Since 1950, many countries have significantly reduced black carbon emissions, especially from fossil fuel sources, primarily to improve public health from improved air quality, and ""technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related BC"" throughout the world.
Given black carbon's relatively short lifespan, reducing black carbon emissions would reduce warming within weeks. Because black carbon remains in the atmosphere only for a few weeks, reducing black carbon emissions may be the fastest means of slowing climate change in the near term. Control of black carbon, particularly from fossil-fuel and biofuel sources, is very likely to be the fastest method of slowing global warming in the immediate future, and major cuts in black carbon emissions could slow the effects of climate change for a decade or two. Reducing black carbon emissions could help keep the climate system from passing the tipping points for abrupt climate changes, including significant sea-level rise from the melting of Greenland and/or Antarctic ice sheets.
""Emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions"". Calculation of black carbon's combined climate forcing at 1.0–1.2 W/m2, which ""is as much as 55% of the CO2 forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other [GHGs] such as CH4, CFCs, N2O or tropospheric ozone."" Other scientists estimate the total magnitude of black carbon's forcing between + 0.2 and 1.1 W/m2 with varying ranges due to uncertainties. (See Table 1.) This compares with the IPCC's climate forcing estimates of 1.66 W/m2 for CO2 and 0.48 W/m2 for CH4. (See Table 2.) In addition, black carbon forcing is two to three times as effective in raising temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and the Arctic than equivalent forcing values of CO2.
Jacobson calculates that reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot particles would eliminate about 40% of the net observed global warming. (See Figure 1.) In addition to black carbon, fossil fuel and biofuel soot contain aerosols and particulate matter that cool the planet by reflecting the sun's radiation away from the Earth. When the aerosols and particulate matter are accounted for, fossil fuel and biofuel soot are increasing temperatures by about 0.35 °C.
Black carbon alone is estimated to have a 20-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 4,470, and a 100-year GWP of 1,055–2,240. Fossil fuel soot, as a result of mixing with cooling aerosols and particulate matter, has a lower 20-year GWP of 2,530, and a 100-year GWP of 840–1,280.
The Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organization calculates that cutting black carbon, along with tropospheric ozone and its precursor, methane, can reduce the rate of global warming by half and the rate of warming in the Arctic by two-thirds, in combination with CO2 cuts. By trimming ""peak warming"", such cuts can keep current global temperature rise below 1.5 ˚C for 30 years and below 2 ˚C for 60 years, in combination with CO2 cuts. (FN: UNEP-WMO 2011.) See Table 1, on page 9 of the UNEP-WMO report Archived 2011-11-05 at the Wayback Machine.
The reduction of CO2 as well as SLCFs could keep global temperature rise under 1.5 ˚C through 2030, and below 2 ˚C through 2070, assuming CO2 is also cut. See the graph on page 12 of the UNEP-WMO report Archived 2011-11-05 at the Wayback Machine.


== Control technologies ==
Ramanathan notes that ""developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more since 1950. Thus, the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon.""
Jacobson believes that ""[g]iven proper conditions and incentives, [soot] polluting technologies can be quickly phased out. In some small-scale applications (such as domestic cooking in developing countries), health and convenience will drive such a transition when affordable, reliable alternatives are available. For other sources, such as vehicles or coal boilers, regulatory approaches may be required to nudge either the transition to existing technology or the development of new technology.""
Hansen states that ""technology is within reach that could greatly reduce soot, restoring snow albedo to near pristine values, while having multiple other benefits for climate, human health, agricultural productivity, and environmental aesthetics. Already soot emissions from coal are decreasing in many regions with transition from small users to power plants with scrubbers.""
Jacobson suggests converting ""[U.S.] vehicles from fossil fuel to electric, plug-in-hybrid, or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, where the electricity or hydrogen is produced by a renewable energy source, such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, or tidal power. Such a conversion would eliminate 160 Gg/yr (24%) of U.S. (or 1.5% of world) fossil-fuel soot and about 26% of U.S. (or 5.5% of world) carbon dioxide."" According to Jacobson's estimates, this proposal would reduce soot and CO2 emissions by 1.63 GtCO2–eq. per year. He notes, however, ""that the elimination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would also eliminate some cooling particles, reducing the net benefit by at most, half, but improving human health"", a substantial reduction for one policy in one country.
For diesel vehicles in particular there are several effective technologies available. Newer, more efficient diesel particulate filters (DPFs), or traps, can eliminate over 90% of black carbon emissions, but these devices require ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD). To ensure compliance with new particulate rules for new on-road and non-road vehicles in the U.S., the EPA first required a nationwide shift to ULSD, which allowed DPFs to be used in diesel vehicles in order to meet the standards. Because of recent EPA regulations, black carbon emissions from diesel vehicles are expected to decline about 70 percent from 2001 to 2020."" Overall, ""BC emissions in the United States are projected to decline by 42 percent from 2001 to 2020. By the time the full fleet is subject to these rules, EPA estimates that over 239,000 tons of particulate matter will be reduced annually. Outside of the US diesel oxidation catalysts are often available and DPFs will become available as ULSD is more widely commercialized.
Another technology for reducing black carbon emissions from diesel engines is to shift fuels to compressed natural gas. In New Delhi, India, the supreme court ordered shift to compressed natural gas for all public transport vehicles, including buses, taxis, and rickshaws, resulted in a climate benefit, ""largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines"". Overall, the fuel switch for the vehicles reduced black carbon emissions enough to produce a 10 percent net reduction in CO2-eq., and perhaps as much as 30 percent. The main gains were from diesel bus engines whose CO2-eq. emissions were reduced 20 percent. According to a study examining these emissions reductions, ""there is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.""
Technologies are also in development to reduce some of the 133,000 metric tons of particulate matter emitted each year from ships. Ocean vessels use diesel engines, and particulate filters similar to those",1
Roasting jack,"A roasting jack is a machine which rotates meat roasting on a spit. It can also be called a spit jack, a spit engine or a turnspit, although this name can also refer to a human turning the spit, or a turnspit dog.  Cooking meat on a spit dates back at least to the 1st century BC, but at first spits were turned by human power.  In Britain, starting in the Tudor period, dog-powered turnspits were used; the dog ran in a treadmill linked to the spit by belts and pulleys.  Other forms of roasting jacks included the steam jack, driven by steam, the smoke jack, driven by hot gas rising from the fire, and the bottle jack or clock jack, driven by weights or springs.


== Weight or clock jacks ==
A great majority of the jacks used prior to the 19th century were powered by a descending weight, often made of stone or iron, sometimes of lead. Although most commonly referred to as spit engines or jacks, these were also termed weight or clock jacks (clock jacks was the more common term in North America).
Earlier jacks of this type had a train of two arbors (spindles), later ones had a more efficient three arbor train. In the case of British examples, almost without exception, the governor or flywheel was set above the engine (as opposed to being located within the frame) and to one side; to the right for two train and to the left for three train engines.
European jacks are characterised by a flywheel set centrally and often within the frame; commonly the highest part of the frame has a bell-like arch that the shaft for the flywheel passes through.


== Steam jack ==
A steam-powered roasting jack was first described by the Ottoman polymath and engineer Taqi al-Din in his Al-Turuq al-samiyya fi al-alat al-ruhaniyya (The Sublime Methods of Spiritual Machines), in 1551.  A steam-driven jack was patented by the American clockmaker John Bailey II in 1792, and steam jacks were later commercially available in the United States.


== Smoke jack ==

Leonardo da Vinci sketched a smoke-jack in the form of a turbine with four vanes.  Smoke-jacks were also illustrated in Vittorio Zonca's book of machines (1607), and in John Wilkins's Mathematical Magick.  The 1826 A Treatise of Mechanics describes a smoke-jack:

Smoke-jack is an engine used for the same purpose as the common jack; and is so called from its being moved by means of the smoke, or rarefied air, ascending the chimney, and striking against the sails of the horizontal wheel AB (plate XXI. fig 1.), which being inclined to the horizon, is moved about the axis of the wheel, together with the pinion C, which carries the wheels D and E; and E carries the chain F, which turns the spit. The wheel AB should be placed in the narrow part of the chimney, where the motion of the smoke is swiftest, and where also the greatest part of it must strike upon the sails.—The force of this machine depends on the draught of the chimney, and the strength of the fire.
Smoke-jacks are sometimes moved by means of spiral flyers coiling about a vertical axle; and at other times by a vertical wheel with sails like the float-boards of a mill: but the above is the more customary construction.


== Bottle-jack ==

A bottle-jack was a clockwork motor in a brass shell, shaped like a bottle; it was introduced in the late 18th Century and in many cases replaced the earlier and much more simple dangle spit.

Burning Index,"Burning Index (BI) is a number used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to describe the potential amount of effort needed to contain a single fire in a particular fuel type within a rating area. The National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) uses a modified version of Bryam's equation for flame length – based on the Spread Component (SC) and the available energy (ERC) – to calculate flame length from which the Burning Index is computed.
The equation for flame length is listed below:

  
    
      
        
          F

Experimental animation,"Experimental animation is a form of animation in which motion pictures have their own rhythm and movement where it has no narration or a specific structure in animated films. It is considered to be subjective and non-linear that deals with philosophic and spiritual concerns that the artists and film-makers convey.
Despite that the early history of experimental animation is still being researched, U.S. and European abstract artists and animators play an important role of developing experimental animation during the 1920s and 1930s. Experimental animation has prominently given people the opportunity to learn and use animation skills in employable jobs, creating a platform for women to express themselves, and combining abstract art and technology to deliver a message that can change people's perspectives of the world.
Well-known animated studios, such as Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar, use the elements of experimental animation as tools for their short- and long-length animated films.


== History ==
Abstract and various forms of experimental animation have come a long way to become part of the traditional arts, where they have been spreading across a large number of art exhibitions, animation festivals, books and videos that relate to experimental animation. A majority of experimental animators were aware that their works were not getting enough recognition in the entertainment world, such as movies and music. However, they have been able to use animation as a medium that is used to deliver their messages or concerns to the public. Animators are able to use their animation skills in order to get involved in money-earning activities, such as family-friendly movies and TV shows, TV commercials and music videos.


=== Europe ===
In 1912, Leopold Survage began his series of abstract watercolour paintings called the ‘Colored Rhythm’, where he planned them in motion by using film animation techniques. However, he found no one who was willing to animate his work so he postponed his project and then committed to painting for the rest of his life. During the same period, Viking Eggeling was struggling with the concept of abstract images as a universal language, and he was yet unaware that motion picture was a medium. Although there was no concrete evidence that Eggeling knew about Survage’s project, it was likely that he had heard or read about it since his friend, Amedeo Modigliani knew Survage well enough and that both have a mutual close friend, Tristan Tzara. Tzara introduced Eggeling to Hans Richter which led them to pursue a meaningful discovery of abstract forms by using moving pictures. Throughout this journey, Eggeling created ‘Diagonal Symphony' and Richter made 'Rhythm 21', 'Rhythm 23' and 'Rhythm 25'. Before these films were produced, Walter Ruttmann displayed his hand-coloured abstract film ‘Lightplay Opus I’ in Germany, which was described by Bernhard Diebold as “a new art, the vision-music of films”. Diebold's role in influencing the early abstract animators remained unclear as he reviewed paintings, dance, music and films in 1916. However, he was a mentor to Oskar Fischinger who started to do experimental animation during the first screening of Ruttmann's film.
Music was later incorporated in these early abstract animators’ works. Survage, Eggeling and Richter shared a common interest and history in music in which they had given it up in order to pursue their art career. While they struggled with their first abstract designs, Ferruccio Busoni gained their attention where he suggested that they should broaden their understanding of abstract art by playing Bach’s preludes and fugues. Ruttmann and Fischinger also had a music history before doing art. Fischinger was the first to combine technical, musical and artistic talent in his works as well as being the first to make abstract animation be part of his art career.
By 1935, abstract animation films gained more recognition in England, where Len Lye and Norman McLaren brought new ideas of using sound and colour in animation. While abstract animation was succeeding in Europe, Fischinger, Malaren and Lye continued creating experimental animation North America to continue their abstract animation careers in which experimental animation was remained as a North American art since then.
While the early abstract animators in Europe become an enormous part of the historical movement in abstract art and animation, the quality of their artistry in their works attracts people’s attention. Although many films are barely receiving full recognition, they are continuing to grow rather than diminishing in value and animators that their works receive more recognition from a large audience by using video, computer and broadcast technologies.


=== United States ===
Abstract animation began to develop in New York and California. In the 1940s, Oskar Fischinger, Norman McLaren, John and James Whitney and Dwinell Grant were given grants for their abstract films by the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation with Baroness Hilla Rebay as its director.
Most American abstract animators had their films displayed at special programs in The Museum of Modern Art or Cinema 16, which is a New York City film society founded by Amos Vogel. Cinema 16 held monthly programs of experimental and documentary films and its success inspired smaller film societies in other locations, particularly college towns. For instance, Art in Cinema was presented at the San Francisco Museum of Art which was organised by Richard Foster and Frank Stauffacher. In the 1950s, Perry Miller’s Film Advisory Center sponsored several Art Film Festivals in New York City to present experimental animation created by Mary Ellen Bute, Douglass Crockwell and Francis Lee, as well as documentaries about artists and art.
Some American abstract animators were inspired or influenced by the European abstract animators. For instance, Robert Bruce Rogers was under the influence of Oskar Fischinger by incorporating music into his “motion painting” when he presented his film ‘Motion Painting No. 3 – Rhapsody’ (1951). His film was based on Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6 and composed a “three-dimensional space contrivance of [his] own, the field of operations being a foreshortened replica of the ultimate projection beam – a pyramided field, roughly 23 inches by 32 inches at the base of background limit, and 38 inches from camera aperture as apex”. Although Rogers’ abstract films no longer existed, he was considered as one of the American creators in abstract animation.
Oskar Fischinger, John and James Whitney and Harry Smith were the major animators of the new generation experimental animation in the West Coast. Hy Hirsh and Jordan Belson later became part of the American pioneers in abstract animation, where they created their own abstract films by using superimposed oscilloscope patterns printed in coloured filters. Their abstract film ‘Come Closer’ (1953) was presented in the San Francisco Museum of Arts for the Art in Cinema festivals, and it was known to be “the first abstract film in 3D”.


== Impacts ==
Hundreds of students have enrolled in animation classes every year as experimental animation begins to expand in art schools, colleges and universities. A majority of students have attended these classes because they have an interest in learning the skills that can help them become employable. Meanwhile, others attended animation classes as they see animation as an art medium that they relate or can express themselves. Jules Engel believes that the future of experimental animation, which he calls fine art animation, depends on people who will promote the abstract film as galleries.
Women have been given an opportunity in colleges and art school to learn animation skills and become animators in their own rights. In the 1970s, the first wave of animated films has been made where women are able to express themselves and their emotional autobiographies. Additionally, the female characters in animated films have developed personalities as they show their emotions. However, many female animators have abandoned their animated film careers so they can work on live-action films. This does not indicate that animation is failing; instead, it gives the animators a better understanding and experience on the animation process. It is also their decision to continue to further pursue their animation careers due to their skills, character and commitment.
The growth of technology, computer science and electronic communication is producing profound changes in the cultural environment, which have significantly affected people’s perceptions of the world. Due to experimental animation, young animators are currently focusing on using their creative abilities in television advertising and music videos rather than devoting themselves to art projects.


=== Experimental Animation in the Expanded Cinema ===
Gene Youngblood’s book Expanded Cinema is believed to be the originator of the 'Expanded Cinema' movement, where films is considered as an art form and establishes the field of media arts. Youngblood also explains that expanded cinema requires consciousness that can reach through the cinematic technologies. His main objective is for motion picture to take part in the art media by using film as a means to reject the expectations of industry standardization.
Intermedia practice and theory are known to be the central aspect of the expanded cinema and experimental animation, where animators use different qualities of media in their films. Stan VanDerBeek is known to bridge experimental animation and the Expanded Cinema as he is fascinated with free movements in animation when employing different forms of art forms in his film 'Move Movies' (1965). He is also considered to be the founder in intermedia as his work stresses the differential qualities of the media combined.
Abstraction also plays a significant role in uniting experimental animation and the Expanded Cinema. Abstract films bring imagery that may carry no real-world references but also encompasses to capture a deeper meaning that can shape the society's traditional perspectives and expectations of the real world. And they can be presented in range of traditional animation to computer animation. There are various connections between the Expanded Cinema, experimental animation and film, and the wider arts.


== Elements of Experimental Animation ==


=== Abstraction ===
Experimental animation is subjective, which is the purest and complex form of animation. It requires the artist to invent unique forms, shapes and colours that have their own rhythm and movement in a new and expressive way.


=== Specific Non-Continuity ===
Experimental animation has no logical and linear continuity. It defines itself to have illogical, irrational and multiple connections in animated films due to the fact that it ignores the narrative or storytelling structure.


=== Interpretive Form ===
Experimental animation ignores the conservative and predictable nature the exterior world because it generally focuses the abstract forms in motion. Because of its subjective nature, the audiences have different perspectives as they interpret the experimental animated works on their own and create their own meanings and speculations that are beyond the surface value. Therefore, experimental animation uses animation in a metaphoric way, yet it is not entirely supporting the area of the purely
abstract.


=== Evolution of Materiality ===
Forms, shapes and colours are primarily focused in which they symbolise and evoke the artist or filmmaker's emotions and thoughts in experimental animation. Filmmakers suggest that these aspects should have its own rights on their rhythm and movement rather than being involved with a specific structure of a narrative.


=== Multiple Styles ===
Different styles of animation are combined in experimental animation in which it operates by assisting the multiple layers of the artist's personal foresights. It also operates by challenging and re-working the structure of orthodox animation and create new effects of the animation.


=== Presence of the Artist ===
Experimental animation is known to be personal, subjective and original responses that the artists convey on particular topics. Due to the emotional and spiritual relationship between the artist and his or her work, the audiences also develop emotional, philosophical and spiritual connections with the artist. Experimental animation focuses on the philosophic and spiritual concerns as well as personal feelings from the artist or filmmaker.


=== Dynamics of Musicality ===
There is a strong relationship between experimental animation and music where music can be visualised as colours and shapes that can move in different rhythms and speeds. It is also stated that ""animation and sound have a psychological and emotional relationship that can be expressed through the free form which characterises animation"". Experimental animation often resists the dialogue, clichéd sound effects and easy emotiveness of certain music genres. Instead, silence, an avant-garde score and unusual sounds are used in experimental animated films to create a variety of deeper messages that the artist or film-maker conveys.


== Difference Between Orthodox Animation and Experimental Animation ==
While experimental animation is subjective and non-linear, orthodox animation is commonly used as the most appropriate method for cartoons where the figures can be identified as an orthodox human being and creature. Orthodox animation has a specific or logical continuity by prioritising the character and context to make a scenario whereas experimental animation has non-linear and multiple continuities that has no context. It is also important to know that orthodox animation has a narrative form that is held in place by the specific continuity. It wants the audiences to focus on its content, specifically on the character and narrative rather than focusing on the colours, designs and materials that shows the lack of the artist's presence in his or her work. While experimental animation has multiple layers and styles, orthodox animation remains consistent, that is, having a fixed two-dimensional style instead of the three-dimensional modes. In orthodox animation, cartoon characters are often defined by the dynamics of dialogue; for example, Bugs Bunny has been a popular character in Warner Brothers’ Looney Tunes due to his iconic carrot-munching saying, “What’s up, doc?”.


== Influences on mainstream animated films ==


=== Walt Disney's Fantasia ===

Film critic Leonard Maltin describes Walt Disney as a futurist, surrealist and abstract artist, particularly when he had created Fantasia (1940) which remains as “one of the most astonishing films ever to come from Hollywood”. John C. Flinn Sr. (1940) defines Fantasia as a successful experiment that highlights the relationship between animation and classical music. Disney had collaborated with his own staff of highly-trained animators and story-tellers along with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Symphony orchestra. The film illustrates how classical music is represented through the animators’ unique and creative drawings and colourings.
Its sequel Fantasia 2000 (1999) incorporates classical music as well as modern music. In the opening scene, it launched Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 which is visually represented by the abstract movements of butterfly-like triangles that moves on cue to the music. On its third segment, George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue was presented through the use of lines drawings and abstract designs (in the style of cartoonist Al Hirschfeld) and fragmentary stories to illustrate emotional tales that parallel to the music.

Wood grain,"Wood grain is the longitudinal arrangement of wood fibers or the pattern resulting from such an arrangement. It has various derived terms refer to different aspects of the fibers or patterns. Wood grain is important in woodworking and it impacts aesthetics.


== Definition and meanings ==
Wood grain is the longitudinal arrangement of wood fibers or the pattern resulting from such an arrangement. R. Bruce Hoadley wrote that grain is a ""confusingly versatile term"" with numerous different uses, including the direction of the wood cells (e.g., straight grain, spiral grain), surface appearance or figure, growth-ring placement (e.g., vertical grain), plane of the cut (e.g., end grain), rate of growth (e.g., narrow grain), and relative cell size (e.g., open grain).


== Physical aspects ==
The two basic categories of grain are straight grain and cross grain. Straight grain runs parallel to the longitudinal axis of the piece. Cross grain deviates from the longitudinal axis in two ways: spiral grain or diagonal grain. The amount of deviation is called the slope of the grain.

In describing the alignment of the wood in the tree, a distinction may be made. Different tree species may have one of the following basic grain descriptions and types:
straight - grain which runs in a single direction, parallel to the axis of the tree.
spiral - grain which spirals around the axis of the tree.
interlocked - grain which spirals around the axis of the tree, but reverses its direction for periods of years resulting in alternating directions of the spiral grain. On quartersawn surfaces the change in grain direction creates a ribbon stripe figure.
wavy - grain which grows in a wavy fashion up the trunk; seen best in flatsawn sections of wood.
irregular - grain that swirls or twists. It can be found in a number of different patterns. This can be caused by factors such as knots, burls or ""crotch"" wood - where large branches separate from the trunk.


== Woodworking ==
An important physical aspect of wood grain in woodworking is the grain direction or slope (e.g., against the grain). In describing the application of a woodworking technique to a given piece of wood, the direction of the technique may be:

with the grain (easy; giving a clean result)
against the grain (heavy going; giving a poor result such as chipping or tear-out)
across the grain (direction of cut is across the grain lines, but the plane of the cut is still aligned with them)
end grain (at right angles to the grain, for example trimming the end of a plank)
Woods with straight grains are the easiest to work, while woods with interlocked grains are the most difficult.


=== Support ===
Grain alignment must be considered when joining pieces of wood, or designing wooden structures. For example, a stressed span is less likely to fail if tension is applied along the grain, rather than across the grain. Grain direction will also affect the type of warping seen in the finished item.


== Aesthetics ==

In its simplest aesthetic meaning, wood grain is the alternating regions of relatively darker and lighter wood resulting from the differing growth parameters occurring in different seasons (i.e., growth rings) on a cut or split piece of wood.
Figure in wood is produced by causes including fungus, burls, stress, knots, and special grain alignments. Strictly speaking, grain is not always the same as the figure of wood. Figure rarity often promotes the value of both the raw material, and the finished work it becomes a part of. These include:

bird's eye
quilted
curly (fiddleback)
The way a given piece of wood has been sawn affects both its appearance and physical properties:

flat-grain: flat-sawn, slab-sawn, plain sawn, bastard-sawn, or sawn ""through and through"".
edge grain: quarter-sawn or rift-sawn or straight-grained, and
end grain: the grain of wood seen when it is cut across the growth rings.
There is irregular grain in burr wood or burl wood, but this is result of very many knots.

Oxidizing and reducing flames,"A flame is affected by the fuel introduced and the oxygen available. A flame with a balanced oxygen-fuel ratio is called a neutral flame. The color of a neutral flame is semi-transparent purple or blue. This flame is optimal for many uses because it does not oxidize or deposit soot onto surfaces.


== Oxidizing flame ==
If the flame has too much oxygen, an oxidizing flame is produced. When the amount of oxygen increases, the flame shortens due to quicker combustion, its color becomes a more transparent blue, and it hisses/roars. With some exceptions (e.g., platinum soldering in jewelry), the oxidizing flame is usually undesirable for welding and soldering, since, as its name suggests, it oxidizes the metal's surface.  The same principle is important in firing pottery.


== Reducing flame ==
A reducing flame is a flame with insufficient oxygen. It has an opaque yellow or orange color due to carbon or hydrocarbons which bind with (or reduce) the oxygen contained in the materials the flame processes. The flame is also called carburizing flame, since it tends to introduce carbon soot into the molten metal.
The flame also produces carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas which burns on the outer envelope of flame into carbon dioxide.


=== Reducing flames with no carbon ===
Reducing zero-carbon fuel flames, such as reducing hydrogen flames, are exceptions. They don't have an opaque yellow or orange glow, nor do they produce soot or carbon monoxide.

Luminous intensity,"In photometry, luminous intensity is a measure of the wavelength-weighted power emitted by a light source in a particular direction per solid angle unit, based on the luminosity function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye. The SI unit of luminous intensity is the candela (cd), an SI base unit.",0
Goncalo alves,"Gonçalo alves is a hardwood (from the Portuguese name, Gonçalo Alves). It is sometimes referred to as tigerwood—a name that underscores the wood's often dramatic, contrasting color scheme, that some compare to rosewood.
While the sapwood is very light in color, the heartwood is a sombre brown, with dark streaks that give it a unique look. The wood's color deepens with exposure and age and even the plainer-looking wood has a natural luster.
Two species are usually listed as sources for gonçalo alves: Astronium fraxinifolium and Astronium graveolens, although other species in the genus may yield similar wood; the amount of striping that is present may vary.  All trees grow in neotropical forests; Brazil is a major exporter of these woods.

Urvija Kund,"Urvija Kund ( Sanskrit: उर्विजा कुंड ) is a pond related to Goddess Janaki which is described in Ramayana, legendary stories and folk tales. It is believed that King Shreedhwaja Janaka had built a pond at the place where Goddess Sita was manifested, which later became famous as Urvija Kund.


== Description ==
According to Tribhuvan Dasji Maharaj, the chief priest of the Janaki temple at Janaki Sthan, the pond from where Goddess Janaki appeared is called Urvija Kund. There are two ponds in Sitamarhi, one is in Punaura Dham and the other is in Janaki Sthan. Both the ponds are sacred, one is the pond where Goddess Janaki was manifested and the other is the pond where Goddess Janaki was bathed. There is dispute and confusion between the two Kunds. According to some scholars, it is believed that Goddess Janaki appeared in the Urvija Kund of Janaki Sthan. Similarly, according to some other scholars, the Janaki Kund at Punaura Dham is the real Urvija Kund. But presently, the Kund at Janaki Sthan in the city of Sitamarhi is named and called as Urvija Kund. According to tradition, on the Vaishakh Shukla Shashthi, a 19 days Sitamarhi Dham Parikrama Yatra is started from Urvija Kund situated at Janaki Sthan with Janaki Doli, in which saints and devotees participate.

Will of God,"The will of God or divine will is a concept found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and a number of other texts and worldviews, according to which God's will is the cause of everything that exists.


== Thomas Aquinas ==
According to Thomas Aquinas, God is the ""Highest Good"". The Summa Theologiae (question 6, article 3) affirms that ""God alone is good essentially"".
Because in Jesus Christ God there are two natures, the human and the divine one, Aquinas states that in Him there are two distinct wills: the human will and the divine will.


== Balthasar Hubmaier ==
According to early Anabaptist theologian, Balthasar Hubmaier, God had two wills. One was called the ""absolute"" will and could never be changed, also called God's ""hidden"" will. The other, which could be accepted or rejected by people, was called the ""ordained"" will, also titled God's ""Revealed"" will.
The absolute will of God was paired with Predestination while the ordained will was connected to verses in the Bible which seemed to imply Free will. In Hubmaier's concept both Determinism & Free Will existed; a form of Theological Compatibilism.


== Islamic discourse ==
God's command (amr) is the creative act of God and what has been intended for the creation. In Islamic discourse, Mu'tazilites and Ash'aris disagree on God's will (irāda) and God's command. According to the Mu'tazilites, God's commands are genuine expressions of God's will, while Ash'arites generally disagree. The latter also point at the story of Abraham as an example, that God's command (to sacrifice his son) was not his will. The Mu'tazilites, on the other hand, insist that God's command and will are equal, and that God can both will and command only good.
Islamic philosopher Ibn Arabi (1165–1240) was opposed to the idea of Free Will, instead believing that God's will was absolutely Sovereign over all acts and that man's will didn't have any true existence.


== Asian worldviews ==
According to Mongolian belief, the laws of the universe are an expression of God's will (jayayan). Sometimes, God may break its own usual laws and intervene by sending a chosen person to earth.

Khmer sculpture,"Khmer sculpture (Khmer: ចម្លាក់ខ្មែរ, Châmleăk Khmêr [cɑmˈlak kʰmae]) is the stone sculpture of the Khmer Empire, which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in Angkor, which served as the seat of the empire.
Most of the sculpture is religious, reflecting the mixture of Hinduism and Buddhism followed in the empire. Large resources were devoted by the state to the erection of grand and highly decorated religious complexes, which often also serve to glorify the monarch.
There are several recognisable specific art styles of the Angkorian period:

Kulen style (c.825-875)
Koh Ker style (941-944)
Baphuon style (1010-1080)
Angkor Wat style (1100-1175)
Bayon style (late 12th to early 13th century)


== Movement away from Indian models ==

Earlier Khmer art was heavily influenced by Indian treatments of Hindu subject. By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. An example of Khmer style that totally departed from Indian sculpture tradition is the wholeness of its figure, which bears similarities to ancient Egyptian sculpture.
Unlike most Indian and Javanese Hindu-Buddhist stone sculptures, which were carved in high relief, or stelae supported by slabs at the figure's back, Khmer statues are carved wholly in the round. Khmer stone sculpture did not employ any stelae on the back of the figure to support it, as the result broken arms, hands or ankles vividly attest to the vulnerability of this format. Nevertheless, Khmer sculptors seems to wish their works to be seen from all sides in the garbagriha or sanctuary shrine in the center of the temple. Khmers attempted to make free-standing statues, supported by an arch or by an attribute of the divinity such as a piece of clothing or a hand-held object.
Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement. The social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.
The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, Buddhism and Hinduism. Priests supervised the execution of the works, attested to in the high iconographic precision of the sculptures. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the aristocracy through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.

The sculptures are images of gods, royal and imposing presences with feminine sensuality, giving impressions of figures at the courts with considerable power.  The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeeds in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.
But if we go beyond this initial impression, we can pause to observe some of the details of the sculptures, such as the double arc drawn by the eyebrows on the foreheads, evoked below by the wisely sketched curve of the noses and further down, by the double arc which masterfully outlines the lips and the double chin. Following a hypothetical vertical line down still further, we find another double arc outlining the breasts, and then, continuing down from the waist all along the skirts and ending in the ankles, we find almost at the bottom, a twisted double arc intended to represent the other side of the skirts. This detail serves, above all, to eliminate a certain hieratic fixedness, which was relatively common in the Khmer statues of lesser quality.


== Archeological exploration ==

Ever since 1864, when France established a Protectorate in Cambodia, Western travellers have been amazed by the impressive ruins of Angkor. Not long after, once the École française d'Extrême-Orient began to study and catalogue the findings made at the excavations, the growing number of scholars from all around the world, art lovers and admirers of this sculpture, became fervent proponents of Khmer Art.
“Khmer Art, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight, open to all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the arts of the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself upon the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its sense of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.” Thus wrote Madeleine Giteau, the distinguished member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965. 
Currently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention the enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais in Paris and later at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1997.

Glass sculpture,"Studio glass is the modern use of glass as an artistic medium to produce sculptures or three-dimensional artworks in the fine arts.  The glass objects created are intended to make a sculptural or decorative statement, and typically serve no useful function. Though usage varies, the term is properly restricted to glass made as art in small workshops, typically with the personal involvement of the artist who designed the piece.  This is in contrast to art glass, made by craftsmen in factories, and glass art, covering the whole range of glass with artistic interest made throughout history.   Both art glass and studio glass originate in the 19th century, and the terms compare with studio pottery and art pottery, but in glass the term ""studio glass"" is mostly used for work made in the period beginning in the 1960s with a major revival in interest in artistic glassmaking.
Pieces are often unique, or made in a small limited edition. Their prices may range from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of dollars (US).  For the largest installations, the prices are in the millions.
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating glass artworks, including:

Glassblowing,

== History ==

From the 19th century, various types of fancy glass started to become significant branches of the decorative arts. Cameo glass was revived for the first time since the Romans, initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement in particular made great use of glass, with René Lalique, Émile Gallé, and Daum of Nancy important names in the first French wave of the movement, producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using lustre techniques. Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in secular stained glass, mostly of plant subjects, both in panels and his famous lamps. From the 20th century, some glass artists began to class themselves as sculptors working in glass and as part of the fine arts.
In the early 20th century, most glass production happened in factories. Even individual glassblowers making their own personalized designs would do their work in those large shared buildings. The idea of ""art glass"" grew – small decorative works in small production runs, often with designs or objects inside.

By the 1970s, there were good designs for smaller furnaces, and in the United States this gave rise to the ""studio glass"" movement of glassblowers, who worked outside of factories, often in their own buildings or studios. This coincided with a move towards smaller production runs of particular styles. This movement spread to other parts of the world as well.


=== Techniques used in modern studios ===
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating their pieces. The ancient technique of blown glass, where a glassblower works at a furnace full of molten glass using metal rods and hand tools to blow and shape almost any form of glass, is one of the more popular ways to work. Most large hollow pieces are made this way, and it allows the artist to be improvisational as they create their work.

Another type is flame-worked glass, which uses torches and kilns in its production. The artist generally works at a bench using rods and tubes of glass, shaping with hand tools to create their work. Many forms can be achieved this way with little investment into money and space. Though the artist is somewhat limited in the size of the work that can be created, a great level of detail can be achieved with this technique. The paperweights by Paul Stankard are good examples of what can be achieved with flame-working techniques. In the 21st century, flame-worked glass became commonly used as adornments on functional items. The glass conductor's baton, commissioned by Chandler Bridges for Dr. Andre Thomas, is a clear example of flame-working being used to transform a traditional item into an artistic statement.
Cast glass can be done at the furnace, at the torch or in a kiln. Generally the artist makes a mold out of refractory, sand, or plaster and silica which can be filled with either clear glass or colored or patterned glass, depending on the techniques and effects desired. Large scale sculpture is usually created this way.  Slumped glass and fused glass is similar to cast glass, but it is not done at as high of a temperature. Usually the glass is only heated enough to impress a shape or a texture onto the piece, or to stick several pieces of glass together without a glue.
The traditional technique of stained glass is still employed for the creation of studio glass. The artist cuts the glass into shapes and sets the pieces into lead cames which are soldered together.  They artist can also use hot techniques in a kiln to create texture, patterns, or change the overall shape of the glass.
Etched glass is created by dipping glass that has an acid resistant pattern applied to its surface into an acid solution. Also an artist can engrave it by hand using wheels. Sandblasting can create a similar effect.
Cold glass is any glass worked without the use of heat. Glass may be cut, chiseled, sandblasted, and glued or bonded to form art objects ranging from small pieces to monumental sculpture.

== The studio glass movement ==
The international studio glass movement originated in America, spreading to Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia. The emphasis of this movement was on the artist as the designer and maker of one-of-a-kind objects, in a small studio environment.  This movement enabled the sharing of technical knowledge and ideas among artists and designers that, in industry, would not be possible.
With the dominance of Modernism in the arts, there was a broadening of artistic media throughout the 20th century. Indeed, glass was part of the curriculum at art schools such as the Bauhaus. Frank Lloyd Wright produced glass windows considered by some as masterpieces not only of design, but of painterly composition as well.  During the 1950s, studio ceramics and other craft media in the U.S. began to gain in popularity and importance, and American artists interested in glass looked for new paths outside industry. Harvey Littleton, often referred to as the ""Father of the Studio Glass Movement"", was inspired to develop studio glassblowing in America by the great glass being designed and made in Italy, Sweden and many other places, and by the pioneering work in ceramics of the California potter Peter Voulkos. Harvey Littleton and Dominick Labino held the now-famous glass workshop at the Toledo Museum of Art in 1962.  The goal was to melt glass in a small furnace so individual artists could use glass as an art medium in a non-industrial setting.  This was the workshop that would stimulate the studio glass movement that spread around the world.  Instead of the large, industrial settings of the past, a glass artist could now work with a small glass furnace in an individual setting and produce art from glass.


== Modern regional glass art ==


=== Australia ===
The early glass movement (studio glass) in Australia was spurred on by a visit to Australia by American artist Bill Boysen, who toured the country in the early seventies with a mobile studio. Boysen traveled to Australia in 1974, where he promoted glass artistry by presenting a ""revolutionary demonstration of glass blowing"" to a gathering of around 250 attendees. Boysen's mobile studio ""successfully toured eight eastern states’ venues in ’74, thus greatly enhancing the credibility of hand crafted glass."" Boysen's visit is credited with helping ""inspire a generation of [Australian] artists to work with glass and eventually led to the creation of the national glass art collection"" in Wagga Wagga, Australia. This important collection includes over 450 works of art and is ""the most comprehensive public collection of Australian studio glass anywhere."" Since that time Australian glass has gained worldwide recognition with Adelaide in South Australia, hosting the International Glass Art Society Conference in 2005 on only its third occasion outside of the U.S. The Ranamok Glass Prize, presented every year from 1994 to 2014, promotes contemporary glass artists living in Australia and New Zealand.


=== Belgium ===
Daniël Theys en Chris Miseur from the glass factory Theys & Miseur in Kortrijk-Dutsel, Belgium, which represent Belgian artistic glass work concerning the entire world. In 2015, John Moran (winner of Blown Away Season 3) co-founded Gent Glas, a public glass studio focused on introducing glass as an artistic medium to the general public. The studio has gone on to invite over 40 visiting artists from 13 different countries.


=== China ===
Although China has a very long tradion of glass art, studio glass was arguably first made by Loretta H. Yang and Chang Yi in 1987 at the first contemporary Chinese liuli art studio Liuligongfang.  In 1997, Yang and Chang released their technique and procedure to the public.  The Liuligongfang technique has since become a key cornerstone upon which contemporary Chinese liuli is built with Yang and Chang widely recognized as the pioneers and founders of contemporary Chinese liuli.


=== Italy ===

Glass blowing began in the Roman Empire, and Italy has refined the techniques of glass blowing ever since. Until the very recent explosion of glass shops in Seattle (US), there were more on the Island of Murano (Italy) than anywhere else in world. The majority of the refined artistic techniques of glassblowing (e.g., incalmo, reticello, zanfirico, latticino) were developed there. Moreover, generations of blowers passed on their techniques to family members. Boys would begin working at the fornace (actually ""furnace""—called ""the factory"" in English).


=== Japan ===
Japanese glass art which was inspired by the studio glass movement of the 1960s has a short history. The first independent glass studios of this period were built by Saburo Funakoshi and Makoto Ito, and Shinzo Kotani in separate places. Yoshihiko Takahashi and Hiroshi Yamano show their works at galleries throughout the world and are arguably Japan's glass artists of note. Yoichi Ohira has worked with great success in Murano with Italian gaffers. The small Pacific island Niijima, administered by Tokyo, has a renowned glass art center, built and run by Osamu and Yumiko Noda, graduates of Illinois State University, where they studied with Joel Philip Myers. Every autumn, the Niijima International Glass Art Festival takes place inviting top international glass artists for demonstrations and seminars. Emerging glass artists, such as Yukako Kojima and Tomoe Shizumu, were featured at the 2007 Glass Art Society exhibition space at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Toshichi Iwata and Kyohei Fujita were noteworthy Japanese studio glass artists who worked before and after the studio glass movement of the 1960s. Both were active studio glass artists by the late 1940s. Fujita got his start working in the production part of Toshichi Iwata's studio which was founded in 1947.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico was the first country in Latin America to have a glass factory in the early sixteenth century brought by the Spanish conquerors. Although traditional glass in Mexico has prevailed over modern glass art, since the 1970s there have been a List of glass artists#Mexico  that have given a place to that country in international glass art.


=== The Netherlands ===
Glass art in the Netherlands is mainly stimulated by the glass designing and glass blowing factory Royal Leerdam Crystal. Such notable designers as H.P. Berlage, Andries Copier and Sybren Valkema, Willem Heesen (Master Glassblower as well) had a major influence on Dutch glass art. Later the studio glass movement, inspired by the American Harvey Littleton and the new Workgroup Glass founded by Sybren Valkema at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam led to a new generation of glass artists.


=== United Kingdom ===

Notable centres of glass production in the UK have been St. Helens in Merseyside (the home of Pilkington Glass and the site on which lead crystal glass was first produced by George Ravenscroft), Stourbridge in the Midlands and Sunderland in the North East. Sunderland is now home to the National Glass Centre which houses a specialist glass art course. St. Helens boasts a similar establishment but without the educational body attached. Perthshire in Scotland was known internationally for its glass paperweights. It has always hosted the best glass artists working on small scales, but closed its factory in Crieff, Scotland in January 2002.
Glass artists in the UK have a variety of exhibitions. The Scottish Glass Society hosts a yearly exhibition for members, the Guild of Glass Engravers exhibit every two years and the British Glass Biennale, begun in 2004 is now opening its third show.
British Glass Art owes much to the long history of craft. The majority of its glass blowers who operate small studio furnaces produce aesthetically beautiful though primarily functional objects. Technical skill as a blower is given as much importance as the artistic intent.
The Glasshouse, one of the first artist run UK studios, was established in 1967. Artists such as Jane Bruce, Steven Newell, Catherine Hough, Annette Meech, Christopher Williams and Simon Moore spent time working there until it closed its doors in the late 1990's.
There are now a growing number of glass studios in the UK. Many specialize in production glassware while others concentrate on one off or limited edition pieces. An Arts Council funded, non-profit making organisation, the Contemporary Glass Society, founded in 1976 as British Artists in Glass, exists to promote and support the work of glass artists in the UK.
Other glass organisations in the UK are The Guild of Glass Engravers, the Scottish Glass Society and Cohesion. Cohesion is a different sort of entity to the other organisations in that it was specifically founded to promote and develop glass art as a commercial concern. It organises trade events in and around the UK and at the international level. Originally it focused only on artists based the north east of England but has since expanded its remit to cover the whole of the UK.
An internationally renown center for glass, NorthLands Creative Glass, was established in late 1990s in the far north of Scotland by Dan Klein, Ian & Bunty Gunn and Robert McClennan as a center of excellence for the exploration of glass. It offered residencies and masterclasses to arts students and established artists both within and outside of the glass field. Sadly, after 27 years, in 2023, NorthLands Creative Glass permanently closed its doors.
In November 2007 the glass sculpture Model for a Hotel was unveiled as an exhibit on the fourth plinth of Trafalgar Square, London.


=== United States ===
The United States has had two phases of development in glass.  The first, in the early and mid-1900s, started in the cities of Toledo, Ohio, and Corning, New York, where factories such as Fenton and Steuben were making both functional and artistic glass pieces. Toledo's rich history in glass goes back to the turn of the century when Libbey Glass, Owens-Illinois and Johns Manville led the world in the manufacturing of glass products. Their reputations earned Toledo the title of the ""Glass Capital of the World."" These industry leaders, along with the Toledo Museum of Art, sponsored the first glass workshop in 1961.  This workshop would lead to a new movement in American studio glass.


==== The American Studio Glass Movement ====
The second, and most prominent, phase in American glass began in 1962, when then-ceramics professor Harvey Littleton and chemist Dominick Labino began the contemporary glassblowing movement.  The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art.  Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. Harvey Littleton extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching and training, including many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including Marvin Lipofsky, Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and Dale Chihuly.
In 1964, Tom McGlauchlin started one of the first accredited glass programs at the University of Iowa, and Marvin Lipofsky founded the university-level glass program at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1964, Dr. Robert C. Fritz founded a university-level glass program at San Jose State University in San Jose, California.  As a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under Harvey Littleton, Bill H. Boysen built the first glass studio at Penland School of Crafts, in Penland, North Carolina, in 1965.  After graduating in 1966, he started the graduate glass program at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Illinois. Dale Chihuly initiated the glass program at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1969. Tom McGlauchlin joined the Toledo Museum of Art as Professor and Director of Glass in conjunction with the University of Toledo's Art program in 1971.


==== American Glass Schools and Studios ====

The growth of studio glass led to the formation of glass schools and art studios located across the country.  The largest concentrations of glass artists are located in Seattle, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County and Corning, New York also have sizable concentrations of artists working in glass.
The Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle has become a mecca for glass artists from all over the world. Those who attend Pilchuck, either college students or established artists, have the opportunity to attend master classes and exchange skills and information in an environment dedicated solely to glass based arts.
Pittsburgh Glass Center in Pittsburgh has residency programs for artists working in glass, as well as a facility for artists to make use of for their works. Pittsburgh Glass Center offers classes to the public on glassblowing and many other forms of glass art. Philadelphia hosts a small array of glass studios for artists that use glass. Home to the National Liberty Museum (featuring all exhibits by international glass artists), Philadelphia hosts the non-profit P.I.P.E. program, with residencies for artists that use glass as well as metal, electroforming on glass, and bronze casting. The state of Pennsylvania has a long tradition of the production of industrial glass and its influence has quickly been absorbed by artists working in glass.
The Studio of The Corning Museum of Glass, established in 1996, is an internationally renowned teaching facility in Corning, NY.  Classes and workshops are held for new and experienced glassworkers and artists.  The Studio's residency program brings artists from around the world to Corning for a month to work in The Studio facilities, where they can explore and develop new glassblowing techniques or expand on their current bodies of work; recipients of the Specialty Glass Residency include Beth Lipman, Mark Peiser, Karen LaMonte, and Anna Mlasowsky. Artists working in The Studio have access to the collections of The Corning Museum of Glass, and benefit from the resources of the Rakow Research Library, whose holdings cover the art and history of glass and glassmaking.
Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center, located in the historic glass industry capital of Millville, New Jersey, is a nonprofit art and history education center that is home to the Museum of American Glass, which houses the largest collection of American glass objects in the world. The collection includes historical glass as well as contemporary work from some of the glass world's biggest names. In addition to the museum, WheatonArts operates a world-class glass studio under the creative direction of Hank Murta Adams. The Creative Glass Center of America, which is funded by WheatonArts and crucial to its mission of continuing Millville's legacy in the glass world, hosts a fellowship program exclusively for up-and-coming and mid-career artists working in glass. Well-known alumnae of the CGCA fellowship include Steve Tobin (1983) Kait Rhoads (1997 and 2008), Lino Tagliapietra (1989), Beth Lipman  (2001), Gregory Nangle (2006), Deborah Czeresko (2006 and 2010), Angus Powers (2003), and Stephen Paul Day (1992, 1997, 2004, and 2009).
San Jose State University glass program was started by Dr. Robert Fritz in 1964 and is the oldest educational studio glass program in California.  Dr. Fritz died suddenly in 1986 and Mary B. White ran the program from 1986 to 2005.


== Techniques and processes ==


=== Stained glass ===

Stained glass, such as the windows that are seen in churches, are windows that contain an element of painting in them. The window is designed. After the glass has been cut to shape, paint that contains ground glass is applied, so that, when it is fired in a kiln, the paint fuses onto the glass surface. Following this process, the sections of glass are placed together and held in place with lead came that is then soldered at the joints.
Leadlights and stained glass are manufactured in the same way, but leadlights do not contain any sections of glass that have been painted.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Blown glass ===
Glassblowing is one of the most used technique for creating ""art glass"" and is still favoured by most of today's studio glass artists. This is because of the artist's intimacy with the material, and an almost infinite opportunity for creativity and variation at almost every stage of the process.  Glassblowing can be used to create a multitude of shapes and can incorporate color through a wide range of techniques.  Coloured glass can be gathered out of a crucible, clear glass can be rolled in powdered colored glass to coat the outside of a bubble, it can be rolled in chips of glass, it can be stretched into rods and incorporated through caneworking, or it can be layered, cut and fused into tiles, and incorporated into a bubble of glass for intricate patterns through murrine.  ""Blown glass"" refers only to individually hand-made items but can include the use of moulds for shaping, ribbing, and spiking to produce decorative bubbles. Glass blown articles must be made of compatible glass or the stress in the piece will cause a failure.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Lampworking ===
Similar to glassblowing, Lampworking (also called flameworking or torchworking) is a style in which the artist manipulates glass with the use of a torch – rather than a blowpipe or blow tube – on a smaller scale. Once in a molten state, the glass is formed by blowing and shaping with tools and hand movements. Though typical lampworking art takes the form of beads, figurines, marbles, small vessels, Christmas tree ornaments, and other such things, it is also used to create scientific instruments as well as glass models of animals and botanical subjects.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Kiln-formed glass ===

Kiln formed glass is usually referred to as warm glass, and can be either made up from a single piece of glass that is slumped into or over a mould or different colours and sheets of glass fused together. The process of hot glass is highly scientific in that the types of glass and temperatures that they must be fired at is quite complicated operation to undertake correctly. Art glass that is kiln formed usually take the form of dishes, plates or tiles. Glass that is fused in a kiln must be of the same co-efficient of expansion (CoE). If glass that does not have the same CoE is used for fusing, the differing rates of contraction will cause minute stress fractures to form and, over time, these fractures will cause a piece to crack. The use of polarizing filters to inspect the work will determine if stress fractures are present.


=== Cold glass ===
Cold glass is worked by any method that does not use heat. Processes include sandblasting, cutting, sawing, chiseling, bonding and gluing.


==== Sandblasting ====
Glass can be decorated by sandblasting the surface of a piece in order to remove a layer of glass, thereby making a design stand out. Items that are sandblasted are usually thick slabs of glass into which a design has been carved by means of high pressure sandblasting. This technique provides a three-dimensional effect but is not suitable for toughened glass as the process could shatter it.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Copperfoil technique ===
The technique of using copperfoil is mainly used in the construction of smaller pieces such as Tiffany style lamps, and it was, in fact, frequently used by Louis Comfort Tiffany.  It consists of wrapping cut sections of glass in a self-adhesive tape that is made out of thin copper foil. This technique requires a great deal of dexterity and is also very time-consuming. After the sections have been foiled, they are soldered together in order to form the item.

Multi-messenger astronomy,"Multi-messenger astronomy is the coordinated observation and interpretation of multiple signals received from the same astronomical event. Many types of cosmological events involve complex interactions between a variety of astrophysical processes, each of which may independently emit signals of a characteristic ""messenger"" type: electromagnetic radiation (including infrared, visible light and X-rays), gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. When received on Earth, identifying that disparate observations were generated by the same source can allow for improved reconstruction or a better understanding of the event, and reveals more information about the source.
The main multi-messenger sources outside the heliosphere are: compact binary pairs (black holes and neutron stars), supernovae, irregular neutron stars, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, and relativistic jets. The table below lists several types of events and expected messengers.
Detection from one messenger and non-detection from a different messenger can also be informative. Lack of any electromagnetic counterpart, for example, could be evidence in support of  the remnant being a black hole.


== Networks ==
The Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS), established in 1999 at Brookhaven National Laboratory and automated since 2005, combines multiple neutrino detectors to generate supernova alerts.  (See also neutrino astronomy).
The Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON), created in 2013, is a broader and more ambitious project  to facilitate the sharing of preliminary observations and to encourage the search for ""sub-threshold"" events which are not perceptible to any single instrument.  It is based at Pennsylvania State University.


== Milestones ==
1940s: Some cosmic rays are identified as forming in solar flares.
1987: Supernova SN 1987A emitted neutrinos that were detected at the Kamiokande-II, IMB and Baksan neutrino observatories, a couple of hours before the supernova light was detected with optical telescopes.
August 2017: A neutron star collision in the galaxy NGC 4993 produced the gravitational wave signal GW170817, which was observed by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. After 1.7 seconds, it was observed as the gamma ray burst GRB 170817A by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and INTEGRAL, and its optical counterpart SSS17a was detected 11 hours later at the Las Campanas Observatory, then by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera. Ultraviolet observations by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, X-ray observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio observations by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array complemented the detection. This was the first gravitational wave event observed with an electromagnetic counterpart, thereby marking a significant breakthrough for multi-messenger astronomy. Non-observation of neutrinos was attributed to the jets being strongly off-axis. In October 2020, astronomers reported lingering X-ray emission from GW170817/GRB 170817A/SSS17a.
September 2017 (announced July 2018): On September 22, the extremely-high-energy (about 290 TeV) neutrino event IceCube-170922A was recorded by the IceCube Collaboration, which sent out an alert with coordinates for the possible source.  The detection of gamma rays above 100 MeV by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration and between 100 GeV and 400 GeV by the MAGIC Collaboration from the blazar TXS 0506+056 (reported September 28 and October 4, respectively) was deemed positionally consistent with the neutrino signal. The signals can be explained by ultra-high-energy protons accelerated in blazar jets, producing neutral pions (decaying into gamma rays) and charged pions (decaying into neutrinos).  This is the first time that a neutrino detector has been used to locate an object in space and a source of cosmic rays has been identified.
October 2019 (announced February 2021): On October 1, a high energy neutrino was detected at IceCube and follow-up measurements in visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays and radio waves identified the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg as possible source.
November 2019 (announced June 2022): A second high energy neutrino detected by IceCube associated with a tidal disruption event AT2019fdr.
June 2023: Astronomers used a new cascade neutrino technique to detect, for the first time, the release of neutrinos from the galactic plane of the Milky Way galaxy, creating the first neutrino-based galactic map.

Certificate of deposit,"A certificate of deposit (CD) is a way to store money at a bank or credit union. A CD is written for a period of time: usually between three months and five years. The person who wanted the CD—the consumer—agrees to give the money to the bank for that period of time and may not take the money back until the time has expired. If the consumer takes the money back before the agreed amount of time, they will have to pay a penalty fee. Once your contract is over, you are given your money back plus the interest it earned. People open CDs instead of savings accounts because the interest is higher. A certificate of deposit (which is common only in the United States) is similar to a time deposit.",0
Diagnosis,"A diagnosis is an accurate and precise account of the nature or cause of something. 
Medical diagnosis is the best-known field, but diagnosis can be applied to any subject. Whereas a doctor diagnoses what is wrong with a patient, a motor mechanic can diagnose the fault in a car. In all cases they replace a vague query, such as ""My car will not start"", with an exact analysis, such as ""It's out of petrol"". Notice the diagnosis is precise enough so the solution can be seen.
These ideas work even in more subtle cases. A boy brings an insect in a box to a natural history museum. He asks an expert ""What is this?"" The expert says ""You mean, apart from it being a beetle?"" When the boy nods, the expert looks at the insect under a magnifying glass, or a binocular microscope. Chances are, it is a common beetle, and the expert can give the boy quite a lot of information about it. 
But if it is not known to the expert, a much longer study is needed. Large reference books will be consulted; trays of similar insects will be taken out of store to be compared. A full diagnosis needs at least the genus and species. If the species is unknown, the detailed work of description is needed for publication.


== Related concepts ==
Mostly, in biological taxonomy, the adjective ""diagnostic"" is used for any distinctive trait which places the specimen in a precise category. For example, A single bone making up the lower jaw is diagnostic of a mammal.
""Diagnostics"" is the name given to procedures which spell out what to do to find the cause of a fault. This term is used a lot in computer systems.

Memory leak,"When a program gets executed, it uses memory. In some cases, a poorly-written program may incorrectly manage the memory that has been given to it. As a consequence, the memory that was actually supposed to be reused after the program has finished its job cannot be accessed again. This is known as a memory leak.
One of the most common reasons for memory leaks is the program not giving its memory back after it has finished execution. 
Memory leaks may result in several issues such as degradation of performance and systems being unresponsive.",0
Photo sculpture,"A photo-sculpture is the reproduction of persons, animals, and things, in 3-dimensions by taking a series of photos in the round and using them as synchronized photo projections to create a sculpture. The process was invented and patented by French artist (painter, sculptor and photographer) François Willème in 1860. He took a series of photographs from around a subject and used them  to carve a likeness of the figure. Contemporary photo sculptures are obtained through a process of 3D scanning and 3D printing. The results are small statues that represent the portrayed entity.
Examples of photographic sculptures include the work of sculptural artist Gwon Osang and experimental artist Oliver Herring.

Impacts of tourism,"Tourism impacts tourist destinations in both positive and negative ways, encompassing economic, political, socio-cultural, environmental, and psychological dimensions.
Economic effects: Increased tax revenue, personal income growth, enhanced  The impacts of tourism, and the creation of additional employment opportunities.
Sociocultural impacts: Interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods. Tourism can also have significant political impacts by influencing government policies and promoting diplomatic relations between countries.
Environmental impacts:

direct effects, including environmental damage, wildlife destruction, deforestation, water pollution;
indirect effects, such as increased harvesting of natural resources to supply food, indirect air and water pollution (including from flights, transport and the manufacture of food and souvenirs for tourists).
Health effects: Tourism also has positive and negative health outcomes for local people. The short-term negative impacts of tourism on residents' health are related to the density of tourist arrivals, the risk of disease transmission, road accidents, higher crime levels, as well as traffic congestion, crowding, and other stressful factors. In addition, residents can experience anxiety and depression related to their risk perceptions about mortality rates, food insecurity, contact with infected tourists, etc. At the same time, there are positive long-term impacts of tourism on residents' health and well-being outcomes through improving healthcare access, positive emotions, novelty, and social interactions.

About 1.4 billion people visited another country in 2019, with tourist spending contributing about US$1.45 trillion to the global economy. Europe is by far the dominant origin and arrival region for tourists, accounting for 51 percent of arrivals and 48 percent of travelers in 2019.
Tourism can be divided into subcategories into which impacts fall: spending from visitors on tourism experiences, like beach holidays and theme parks (domestic and international), business spending, and capital investment.
The economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area. The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by ""residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes"".
In contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local stakeholders all the same. Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items, like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres. Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.
Induced spending, which is the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community. For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination. That individual goes on to spend that dollar on lunch from a local vendor, and that vendor goes on to spend it locally.


=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===

Tourism can economically impact the local people positively or negatively.

Positive impacts on residents and destination, as well as tourists themselves
More jobs available
Higher quality of life
Increased income and wealth
Rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.
Heritage tourism focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.
The local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.
Negative impacts
The benefits are not universal nor guaranteed. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying. Prices can fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out their homes.
Damage to social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment.
As the population increases so do the impacts: resources become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists at a destination site may be depleted.
Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and regulations. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).
The economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region. Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits. Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay them less; this further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.


=== Employment ===
Employment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism. Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors. Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping Indirect jobs related to tourism include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation. Employment may also be generated in construction, because additional superstructures and infrastructure is needed to accommodate tourists. Airports and ports generate seasonal employment opportunities for locals.


=== Tourism satellite account (TSA) ===
The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like forestry or oil and gas Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer. Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad. The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.
Before TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints. This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment. In 2006 Tyrrell and Johnston published The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue and claimed that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it has a good and bd impact on animals classification employment

provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment
is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism
is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission
is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development
provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments
provides information on tourism human resource characteristics
Through collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap. Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and ""tourism's contribution to gross domestic product"".


== Sociocultural impacts ==


=== Commodification of culture ===

Commodification of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable. There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. Rural tourism is seen as a ""cure"" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area. For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.
On the other hand, some researchers argue that contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures. In addition, the ""development cure"", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to various social problems, such as drug abuse, crime, pollution, prostitution, social instability, and growth of capitalist values and a consumer culture.


=== Demonstration effect ===
The demonstration effect was introduced to tourism when the researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists. There are a number of social, economic and behavioral reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their social status.
There are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. First, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in advertising, magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture. In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is weak and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that ""all cultures are in a continual process of change"", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.


=== Community participation ===
Community participation refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits. Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members. By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.


=== Acculturation ===
Acculturation is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant cultures. Typically in tourism the local community is being acculturated as destination community. The local community will experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Diffusion of innovations occurs when the local community adopts practices that were developed by another group. Cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is superseded.
Acculturation is often seen by tourists as a method of modernizing a community. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the ""homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies"".


=== Positive socio-cultural impacts ===

There are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use public services, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall aesthetics of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and recreational facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.
Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, local heritage sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and oral histories. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.


=== Negative socio-cultural impacts ===
Cultural interactions can have negative effects. In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.
Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal drug use, and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution may increase due to tourists looking for a ""good time"". Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents. Culture shock may impact both tourists and their hosts.


==== Contraband ====

Tourism is associated with the export of contraband such as endangered species or certain cultural artifacts.


==== Tourism fatigue and anti-tourism sentiment ====

Excessive hordes of visitors (or of the wrong sort of visitors) can provoke backlashes from otherwise friendly hosts in popular destinations.
The local population in many areas has developed anti-tourism sentiment and begun to protest against tourists. One of the most prominent examples of such a mobilization was the so-called ""Tourists go home"" movement, which emerged in 2014 in Spain due to slogans and mottos calling the tourists to go back to their homes. Venice also faced such problems, and the ""Tourists go home"" slogans appeared on the walls of the city. Moreover, several other countries, such as Japan and the Philippines, are having problems with overtourism.
The year 2017 seems to be a landmark for anti-tourism sentiment as ""a new Spanish social movement against an economic development model based on mass tourism gained following high-profile attacks targeting foreign tourists and local business interests."" Anti-tourism sentiment also seems to be linked to a clash of identity and people's individualism.


=== Tourism and protection of cultural property ===

Tourism and the protection of cultural property are two subject areas that often complement each other, but sometimes also face one another. In the case of cultural tourism, gentle tourism and adventure tourism, there are numerous points of contact between the marketing, mediation and preservation of cultural assets. Sensible use is usually the most effective protection of valuable goods. If cultural assets bring the population an economic advantage, they are also interested in their preservation.
The increase in tourism can be a blessing and a curse at the same time, because social media and other new advertising channels often attract so many tourists to one place that it can lead to ""overkill"". World Heritage Sites are therefore increasingly resorting to visitor restrictions in order to be able to contain the flood of tourists. Conversely, tourism also has the effect that certain cultural assets become known and, in the event of war, parties to the conflict want to prevent their destruction with regard to international opinion.
With regard to the protection of cultural assets in the event of armed conflict, there are numerous initiatives on this topic from the UN, UNESCO and Blue Shield International. This also applies to World Heritage Sites. But only through cooperation with the locals can the protection of tourist cultural sites, world heritage sites, archaeological finds, exhibits and archaeological sites from destruction, looting and robbery be implemented in a sustainable manner. Simply agreeing international contracts and contacting state authorities is not enough. In the event of war, it is particularly important to monitor and implement protection directly on site, because this is the only way to ensure the future use of tourist goods for the population. The founding president of Blue Shield International, Karl von Habsburg, aptly summed it up with the words: ""Without the local community and without the local participants, this would be completely impossible.""


== Environmental impacts ==

Ecotourism, nature tourism, wildlife tourism, and adventure tourism take place in environments such as rain forests, high alpine, wilderness, lakes and rivers, coastlines and marine environments, as well as rural villages and coastline resorts. Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased awareness of environmental stewardship. The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.
Environmental sustainability focuses on the overall viability and health of ecological systems. Natural resource degradation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity are detrimental because they increase vulnerability, undermine system health, and reduce resilience. More research is needed to assess the impacts of tourism on natural capital and ecosystem services. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research is needed to address how the tourism industry impacts waste and wastewater treatment, pollination, food security, raw materials, genetic resources, oil and natural gas regulation and ecosystem functions such as soil retention and nutrient recycling.
Negative environmental consequences related to tourism activities, such as greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, and litter at popular locations, can be significant. The tourism sector accounts for about 5% of global CO2 emissions with aviation contributing to 40% of CO2 emissions related to tourist transportation.


=== Facility impacts ===
Facility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from ""exploration"" to ""involvement"" and then into the ""development"" stage of the tourist area life cycle. During latter phase, there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of superstructure such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructures such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, waste disposal, and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. Noise pollution has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and light pollution can disrupt the feeding and reproductive behavior of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General waste and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates waste plastic and non-biodegradable products.


=== Coastal tourism ===
Many coastal areas are experiencing particular pressure from growing numbers of tourists and rising sea levels due to climate change. Coastal environments are limited in extent consisting of only a narrow strip along the edge of the ocean. Coastal areas are often the first environments to experience the detrimental impacts of tourism. Planning and management controls can reduce the impact on coastal environments and ensure that investment into tourism products supports sustainable coastal tourism.


=== Tourist activities ===

There are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and camping that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of trails through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle. Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of non-native species. Indirect impacts on trails include changes in soil porosity, changes to microflora composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.
As many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random campsites. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding campfires. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.
Certain invasive species, such as the zebra mussel, are spread through tourist activities, which can have a negative impact on local ecosystems. There are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species, such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking, thoroughly cleaning boats when moving between bodies of water, and creating designated pathway management plans.
Wildlife viewing, such as safaris in the savannas of East Africa, can lead to changes in animal behavior. The presence of humans tends to increase the stress hormones of wild animals. Additionally, baboons and hyenas have learnt to track tourist safari vehicles to lead them to cheetah kills, which they then steal.
There is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to trophy hunt lions, rhino, leopards, and even giraffes. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by trophy hunting. There is a continued discussion at national and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.
Another tourism destination activity is scuba diving. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by recreational diving. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that naïve divers who engage in underwater photography are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef. As the cost of underwater photography equipment has declined and its availability increased, it is inevitable that there will be an increase of direct damage to reefs by divers. Other direct impacts include over-fishing for ""marine curios"", sedimentation, and in-fill.


==== Mount Everest ====

Mount Everest attracts many tourist climbers wanting to summit the peak of the highest mountain in the world each year. Everest is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Over the years, carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers, as well as overgrazing by livestock, have damaged the habitats of snow leopards, lesser pandas, Tibetan bears, and scores of bird species. To counteract past abuses, various reforestation programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese government.
Expeditions have removed supplies and equipment left by climbers on Everest's slopes, including hundreds of oxygen containers. A large quantity of the litter of past climbers, including tons of tents, cans, crampons, and human faeces, have been hauled down from the mountain and recycled or discarded. However, more than 260 climbers have died on the Mount Everest upper slopes and their decomposing bodies have not been removed, because they are unreachable or their weight makes carrying the bodies down extremely difficult. Notable in the cleanup endeavours have been the efforts of the Eco Everest Expeditions, the first of which was organized in 2008 to commemorate the death that January of Everest-climbing pioneer Edmund Hillary. Those expeditions also have publicized ecological issues, in particular concerns about the effects of climate change in the region through observations that the Khumbu Icefall is melting.


=== Effects from transportation ===

Since 2009, there has been a steady yearly increase in the number of tourist arrivals worldwide of approximately 4.4 percent. In 2015, there were 1.186 billion tourist arrivals worldwide, of which 54 percent arrived by air travel (640 million), 39 percent (462 million) by motor vehicle, 5 percent by ship transport (59 million), and 2 percent by rail travel (23.7 million). A seven-hour flight on a Boeing 747 produces 220 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is the equivalent of driving an average size family saloon car for a year, or the energy requirement of an average family home for nearly 17 years.


=== Cruise ships ===

Cruises are among the fastest-growing sectors of the global travel industry. Over the past decade, cruise industry revenue grew to 37 billion U.S. dollars, and the demand for cruise travel has increased. Some argue that the profitability of mass tourism overshadows environmental and social concerns. For example, the ocean environment suffers from the dumping of wastewater and sewage, anchors damage the seabed and coral reefs and smokestack emissions pollute the air. Social issues that have been linked to the cruise industry include poor wages and living conditions as well as discrimination and sexual harassment.


=== Small Island tourism ===

Small Islands often depend on tourism, as this industry makes up anywhere from 40 percent to 75 percent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for various islands including Barbados, Aruba, and Anguilla.
Mass tourism, including the cruise industry, tends to put a strain on fragile island ecosystems and the natural resources it provides. Studies have shown that early practices of tourism were unsustainable and took a toll on environmental factors, hurting the natural landscapes that originally drew in the tourists. For example, in Barbados, beaches are the main attraction and have been eroded and destroyed over the years. This is due to inefficient political decisions and policies along with irresponsible tourist activity, such as reckless driving and waste disposal, damaging coastal and marine environments. Such practices also altered physical features of the landscape and caused a loss in biodiversity, leading to the disruption of ecosystems. Many other islands faced environmental damage such as Samoa.
However, visitors are attracted to the less industrial scene of these islands, and according to a survey, over 80 percent of the people enjoyed the natural landscape when they visited, many commenting that they wanted to protect and save the wildlife in the area. Many tourists have turned to practices of sustainable tourism and ecotourism in an attempt to save the nature they enjoy in these locations, while some political entities try to enforce this in an attempt to keep tourism in their island afloat.


== Health impacts ==
Tourism brings both positive and negative effects on the health of local people. The short-term negative effects are related to the density of tourist arrivals, traffic congestion, crowding, crime level, and other stressful factors. Inbound tourism also increases the spread of SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other diseases that transmit from human to human, which recently led to closed borders, travel restrictions, canceled flights, etc.
Road accidents are another negative outcome of tourism development since visitors are not aware of local rules, driving norms, and road conditions. Furthermore, alcohol-related crash rates are significantly higher for tourists.
The positive long-term health outcomes of tourism arrivals can be explained by the influence of positive experiences and social interactions with visitors on physical health and longevity. The literature suggests that diverse social relationships lead to lower risks for morbidity and premature mortality. Since diverse interactions of local people with tourists provide positive experiences that could affect physical health, tourism development might positively influence the health of the local people in the long run through positive emotions and social interactions.
Sexually transmitted infections are also often transferred between visitors and residents.

Magnitude (astronomy),"The magnitude of a star or other celestial object is a number that measures its brightness. Apparent magnitude (m) of a celestial object is a number that measures its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, and absolute magnitude is its actual brightness adjusted for distance. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value. The Sun, at apparent magnitude of −27, is the brightest object in the sky.
Magnitude is a logarithmic measure.  It is measured in a specific wavelength or passband, usually in optical or near-infrared wavelengths.  A full moon is −13 magnitude and the brightest planet, Venus, measures −5.  The brightest man-made objects, Iridium flares, are ranked at −9 and the International Space Station measures −6.


== History ==
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus first invented our system of apparent magnitude. He gave the brightest stars a magnitude of 1 and increased the numbers for dimmer stars. About 300 years later Ptolemy of Alexandria made an encyclopedia of stars based on Hipparchus' work. The Persian astronomer Al-Sufi took Ptolemy's work and gave Arabic names to the stars some 800 years later. Medieval European astronomers simply translated Al-Sufi's work into Latin which is why many stars today have Arabic names.
In recent centuries astronomers have been able to measure the distance of stars, and calculate their absolute magnitude.


== Magnitude systems ==

Apparent magnitude m is a measure of the brightness of a celestial body as seen by a person on Earth (without the earth's atmosphere). The brighter the object appears, the lower the numerical value of its magnitude. For example, Alpha Centauri has higher apparent magnitude (i.e. lower value) than Betelgeuse, because it is much closer to the Earth.
Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude, m, an object would have if it were at a standard distance from Earth. The standard distance is 32.6 light years from Earth. The concept of absolute magnitude allows astronomers to compare the brightness of objects without regard to their distance. When measured using absolute magnitude the sun measures less than Sirius at only 4.8.
Visual magnitude means the amount of brightness of a star on a numbered scale. It is the magnitude based on the sensitivity of the human eye.
Photographic magnitude is different from visual magnitude because photographic film is more sensitive to blue light and radiation the human eye cannot see.

Tidal downsizing,"Tidal downsizing is a hypothetical mechanism for the formation of planets. The process begins with the formation of large clumps of gas, of roughly 10 Jupiter masses, via gravitational instability in the outer parts of the protoplanetary disk. The clumps migrate inward due to gravitational interactions with the gas disk. Solid grains within the clump collide and grow and settle toward the center forming a massive core. The clump is disrupted due to tidal forces or heating from the star when it approaches within a few AU of the star leaving behind a smaller object. Depending on the extent and timing of the mass loss the remnant may be a terrestrial planet, an ice giant or a gas giant.

Astronomy,"Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and the phenomena that occur in the cosmos. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and their overall evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.
Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars.
Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.
Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.


== Etymology ==

Astronomy (from the Greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον astron, ""star"" and -νομία -nomia from νόμος nomos, ""law"" or ""culture"") means ""law of the stars"" (or ""culture of the stars"" depending on the translation). Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects. Although the two fields share a common origin, they are now entirely distinct.


=== Use of terms ""astronomy"" and ""astrophysics"" ===
""Astronomy"" and ""astrophysics"" are synonyms. Based on strict dictionary definitions, ""astronomy"" refers to ""the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties"", while ""astrophysics"" refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with ""the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena"". In some cases, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook The Physical Universe by Frank Shu, ""astronomy"" may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject, whereas ""astrophysics"" is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject. However, since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics. Some fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use ""astronomy"" and ""astrophysics"", partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department, and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees. Some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include The Astronomical Journal, The Astrophysical Journal, and Astronomy & Astrophysics.


== History ==


=== Ancient times ===
In early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that may have had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.
Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.

A particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among the Babylonians, who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations. The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros.

Following the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, and he proposed a model of the Solar System where the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the heliocentric model. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.


=== Middle Ages ===
Medieval Europe housed a number of important astronomers. Richard of Wallingford (1292–1336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the Rectangulus which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies, as well as an equatorium called the Albion which could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar, solar and planetary longitudes and could predict eclipses. Nicole Oresme (1320–1382) and Jean Buridan (1300–1361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus (predecessor of the modern scientific theory of inertia) which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels. Georg von Peuerbach (1423–1461) and Regiomontanus (1436–1476) helped make astronomical progress instrumental to Copernicus's development of the heliocentric model decades later.
Astronomy flourished in the Islamic world and other parts of the world. This led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the Muslim world by the early 9th century. In 964, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest galaxy in the Local Group, was described by the Persian Muslim astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in his Book of Fixed Stars. The SN 1006 supernova, the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and Chinese astronomers in 1006. Iranian scholar Al-Biruni observed that, contrary to Ptolemy, the Sun's apogee (highest point in the heavens) was mobile, not fixed. Some of the prominent Islamic (mostly Persian and Arab) astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include Al-Battani, Thebit, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, Biruni, Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī, Al-Birjandi, and the astronomers of the Maragheh and Samarkand observatories. Astronomers during that time introduced many Arabic names now used for individual stars.
It is also believed that the ruins at Great Zimbabwe and Timbuktu may have housed astronomical observatories. In Post-classical West Africa, Astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons, crafting charts of the heavens as well as precise diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations. Songhai historian Mahmud Kati documented a meteor shower in August 1583.
Europeans had previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in sub-Saharan Africa during the pre-colonial Middle Ages, but modern discoveries show otherwise.
For over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.


=== Scientific revolution ===

During the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.
Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. The English astronomer John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars. More extensive star catalogues were produced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found.
During the 18–19th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.
Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Joseph von Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of temperatures, masses, and sizes.
The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of ""external"" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe. Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as quasars, pulsars, blazars, and radio galaxies. Physical cosmology made huge advances during the 20th century. In the early 1900s the model of the Big Bang theory was formulated, heavily evidenced by cosmic microwave background radiation, Hubble's law, and the cosmological abundances of elements. Space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere. In February 2016, it was revealed that the LIGO project had detected evidence of gravitational waves in the previous September.


== Observational astronomy ==

The main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light, or more generally electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.


=== Radio astronomy ===

Radio astronomy uses radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter, outside the visible range. Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.
Although some radio waves are emitted directly by astronomical objects, a product of thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21 cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.
A wide variety of other objects are observable at radio wavelengths, including supernovae, interstellar gas, pulsars, and active galactic nuclei.


=== Infrared astronomy ===

Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their host star clusters.
With the exception of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. This allows the study of the chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.


=== Optical astronomy ===

Historically, optical astronomy, which has been also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy. Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700 nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.


=== Ultraviolet astronomy ===

Ultraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200 Å (10 to 320 nm). Light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.


=== X-ray astronomy ===

X-ray astronomy uses X-ray wavelengths. Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by synchrotron emission (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases above 107 (10 million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases above 107 Kelvin. Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, all X-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or X-ray astronomy satellites. Notable X-ray sources include X-ray binaries, pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.


=== Gamma-ray astronomy ===

Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.
Most gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.


=== Fields not based on the electromagnetic spectrum ===
In addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.
In neutrino astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III for the detection of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.
Gravitational-wave astronomy is an emerging field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.
The combination of observations made using electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos or gravitational waves and other complementary information, is known as multi-messenger astronomy.


=== Astrometry and celestial mechanics ===

One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.: 39 
Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.
The measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allow astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.
During the 1990s, the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting those stars.


== Theoretical astronomy ==

Theoretical astronomers use several tools including analytical models and computational numerical simulations; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved.
Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models that are based on existing observations and known physics, and to predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of phenomena predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternative or conflicting models. Theorists also modify existing models to take into account new observations. In some cases, a large amount of observational data that is inconsistent with a model may lead to abandoning it largely or completely, as for geocentric theory, the existence of luminiferous aether, and the steady-state model of cosmic evolution.
Phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include:

stellar dynamics and evolution
galaxy formation
large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe
the origin of cosmic rays
general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.
Modern theoretical astronomy reflects dramatic advances in observation since the 1990s, including studies of the cosmic microwave background, distant supernovae and galaxy redshifts, which have led to the development of a standard model of cosmology. This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose nature is currently not well understood, but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations.


== Specific subfields ==


=== Astrophysics ===

Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry ""to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects, rather than their positions or motions in space"". Among the objects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background. Their emissions are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.
In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes; whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.


=== Astrochemistry ===

Astrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the Universe, and their interaction with radiation. The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry. The word ""astrochemistry"" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium. The study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is also called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form. Studies in this field contribute to the understanding of the formation of the Solar System, Earth's origin and geology, abiogenesis, and the origin of climate and oceans.


=== Astrobiology ===

Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. Astrobiology considers the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists, and how humans can detect it if it does. The term exobiology is similar.
Astrobiology makes use of molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, astronomy, physical cosmology, exoplanetology and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories.
This interdisciplinary field encompasses research on the origin of planetary systems, origins of organic compounds in space, rock-water-carbon interactions, abiogenesis on Earth, planetary habitability, research on biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space.


=== Physical cosmology ===

Cosmology (from the Greek κόσμος (kosmos) ""world, universe"" and λόγος (logos) ""word, study"" or literally ""logic"") could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole.

Observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the Big Bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the Big Bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.
In the course of this expansion, the Universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation, which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, nucleosynthesis produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe. (See also nucleocosmochronology.)
When the first neutral atoms formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.
A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.
Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into groups and clusters of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.
Fundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.


=== Extragalactic astronomy ===

The study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the formation and evolution of galaxies, their morphology (description) and classification, the observation of active galaxies, and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.
Most galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into spiral, elliptical and Irregular galaxies.
As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and older stars.: 877–878  Elliptical galaxies may have been formed by other galaxies merging.: 939 
A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.: 875 
Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical.: 879  About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.
An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a supermassive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.: 907  A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.
The large-scale structure of the cosmos is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the superclusters. The collective matter is formed into filaments and walls, leaving large voids between.


=== Galactic astronomy ===

The Solar System orbits within the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.: 837–842, 944 
In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.
Between the stars lies the interstellar medium, a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.
As the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.

Diamond willow,"Diamond willow is a type of tree with wood which is transformed into diamond-shaped segments that have alternating colors. Salix bebbiana, the most common, is a species of willow indigenous to Canada and the northern United States, from Alaska and Yukon south to California and Arizona and northeast to Newfoundland and New England. Among common names are beaked willow, long-beaked willow, gray willow, and Bebb's willow. This species is also called red willow by Native Americans according to The Arctic Prairies Appendix E by Ernest Tompson Seton.
The diamond shapes can be caused by a fungus (Valsa sordida and possibly others). Diamond willow fungus is known to have medicinal properties and is used for both medical and ceremonial purposes by First Nations; it has been called a ""sacred medicine.""  
Diamond willow is prized by wood carvers and furniture makers for its strong contrasting colors (red and white) and its sculptural irregularity of shape. 
There are at least six different species that have been identified as being susceptible to diamonding, including Salix bebbiana (the most common) plus S. pseudomonticola, S. arbusculoides, S. discolor, S. scouleriana, and S. alaxensis. 
The diamonding is usually found with a branch at its center or is found in the Y of a tree. Diamonding in willow does not seem to be specific to an area that willows grow in, and where one bunch of willow will have diamonds, the next clump of willows may have none at all. Although diamond willow is often thought of as being a northern phenomenon, of the boreal forest, there is mention of diamond willow growing as far south as Missouri.


== Diamond formation and shape ==
The tree grows diamond-shaped cankers in response to the fungus. If the branch is relatively small it seems to die very quickly. If the branch is larger, it may continue to grow and the diamond is formed on the branch and the stem. New layers of growth occur further and further away from the site of the fungus. If the tree has been affected in several places close together, then the diamonds run into each other, resulting in pronounced ridges if some sapwood continues to survive. 

 
The shape of the diamonds seems to vary from one clump of willow to the next, although there may be some general tendencies within a single species. Some stems will form long narrow diamonds; others will be short and wide. All the diamonds on the stems in one clump will usually have similar growth patterns. If the new layers of sapwood do not move back very much each year, then the diamonds will be deep bowl or cleft-shaped. These stems will be able to survive longer than the ones with flat diamonds. The bark that is left over the top of the diamond changes quite markedly from the bark over the living sapwood. Depending on the species of willow, the living bark is usually smoother and slightly lighter in color. The bark over the diamond typically becomes rougher and somewhat darker. It also becomes tougher and adheres much more to the underlying wood. The sapwood is white to cream in color depending on the species and the location. The heartwood is reddish-brown. This color tends to darken with exposure to light over a number of years.
If one stem in a clump of willow is affected, then all of them are likely to be. However, the neighboring clump may be complete without diamonds. Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) has been known to bear depressions that resemble diamonding.

Carver's Companion",1
Fire,"Fire is a chemical reaction that gives off light and heat. Fire happens when a material rapidly oxidizes, or loses electrons, and releases a great amount of energy. Flames are only the portion of the fire that gives off visible light. 
Fire is sometimes useful, but also very dangerous because it can cause houses, trees and other things to burn to ashes. Forest fires are very harmful. They can destroy a huge area in a matter of minutes. Every year people die by accidents from fire.
Fire can be started by heating a material in many different ways. Once the material is heated past a temperature called the ignition point, it will start to burn, beginning a fire. Some common ways to start a fire include rubbing sticks together very rapidly, making sparks by hitting flint with steel, or using matches or a lighter. The Sun does not make fire. Instead, it crushes together hydrogen atoms to release energy through a process called nuclear fusion.


== Uses ==
Fire can be very useful if it is treated carefully. It has always been very important for people to be able to make fire. People need its heat to keep warm on cold days. It is also used to cook meats. Its light helped people see in dark places and scare away predators.
Most heat engines work by fire.


== Danger ==
If human skin touches fire, the skin may burn, which can take some time to heal and to remove the scar.  If a fire gives off a large amount of smoke, a person's mouth should be covered with a wet cloth, since people can faint when they breathe in too much smoke.  Even a spark, such as from a cigarette, should be kept away from any fuels that very easily catch and spread fire, like gasoline, or cause an explosion, like gunpowder.
If fire is not treated carefully, it can be very dangerous.  One wildfire sometimes burns thousands of square miles or kilometers.  Forests can burn down if fires are not controlled. Every year, large areas of forests are destroyed because of fire.  This usually happens in the summer.


== Controlling ==
In some camps, there is a camp fire; around the camp fire, there are usually some rocks to stop it from spreading. In buildings, fire shutters can be used. Fire shutters contain a fire. With the help of effective shutters, a fire cannot spread from room to room in a building.
Fire needs three things to burn: oxygen, fuel, and heat. Fuels can be wood, tinder, coal, oil, or any other substance that will easily oxidize. Once a fire is burning, it creates its own heat. This lets the fire keep burning on its own for some time.
Firefighters are people with special training to control and stop fires. They also rescue victims of fire related incidents.
A fire can be stopped in three different ways:

The fuel can be removed.  If a fire burns through all of its fuel and extra nearby fuel is removed, the fire will stop burning.
The oxygen can be removed.  This is called ""smothering"" a fire.  Fires cannot burn in a vacuum or if they are covered in carbon dioxide.
The heat can be removed. The most common way to remove heat is to use water to absorb that heat, putting the fire out.
However, some fires cannot be smothered, such as magnesium flames. They can burn in carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and some other elemental compounds. However, they cannot burn in noble gases such as helium.


== Reactions ==
Fires are usually combustion reactions that take carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The products are commonly water and carbon dioxide, although there are other examples that avoid this generalization, such as burning magnesium in air, which makes magnesium oxide.
Fires can occur in many ways. There are many types of fire. There are wood fires, gas fires, metal fires, and more.
Wood fires can usually be put out with water because water absorbs heat, but metal fires are too hot for water to absorb enough heat to put out the fire. If water is used to extinguish (""put out"") a metal fire, the water will simply evaporate. For metal fires, sand can be used to cover the fire and keep it from obtaining oxygen. A fire extinguisher can put out most fires.

Universal basic income,"Universal basic income (UBI) is a social welfare proposal in which all citizens of a given population regularly receive a minimum income in the form of an unconditional transfer payment, i.e., without a means test or need to work. In contrast, a guaranteed minimum income is paid only to those who do not already receive an income that is enough to live on. A UBI would be received independently of any other income. If the level is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (i.e., at or above the poverty line), it is sometimes called a full basic income; if it is less than that amount, it may be called a partial basic income. As of 2024, no country has implemented a full UBI system, but two countries—Mongolia and Iran—have had a partial UBI in the past. There have been numerous pilot projects, and the idea is discussed in many countries. Some have labelled UBI as utopian due to its historical origin.
There are several welfare arrangements that can be considered similar to basic income, although they are not unconditional. Many countries have a system of child benefit, which is essentially a basic income for guardians of children. A pension may be a basic income for retired persons. There are also quasi-basic income programs that are limited to certain population groups or time periods, like Bolsa Familia in Brazil, which is concentrated on the poor, or the Thamarat Program in Sudan, which was introduced by the transitional government to ease the effects of the economic crisis inherited from the Bashir regime. Likewise, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted some countries to send direct payments to its citizens. The Alaska Permanent Fund is a fund for all residents of the U.S. state of Alaska which averages $1,600 annually (in 2019 currency), and is sometimes described as the only example of a real basic income in practice. A negative income tax (NIT) can be viewed as a basic income for certain income groups in which citizens receive less and less money until this effect is reversed the more a person earns.
Critics claim that a basic income at an appropriate level for all citizens is not financially feasible, fear that the introduction of a basic income would lead to fewer people working, and/or consider it socially unjust that everyone should receive the same amount of money regardless of their individual needs. Proponents say it is indeed financeable, arguing that such a system, instead of many individual means-tested social benefits, would eliminate much more expensive social administration and bureaucratic efforts, and expect that unattractive jobs would have to be better paid and their working conditions improved because there would have to be an incentive to do them when already receiving an income, which would increase the willingness to work. Advocates also argue that a basic income is fair because it ensures that everyone has a sufficient financial basis to build on and less financial pressure, thus allowing people to find work that suits their interests and strengths.
Early examples of unconditional payments to citizens date back to antiquity, and the first proposals to introduce a regular unconditionally paid income for all citizens were developed and disseminated between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the Industrial Revolution, public awareness and support for the concept increased. At least since the mid-20th century, basic income has repeatedly been the subject of political debates. In the 21st century, several discussions are related to the debate about basic income, including those concerning the automation of large parts of the human workforce through artificial intelligence (AI), and associated questions regarding the future of the necessity of work. A key issue in these debates is whether automation and AI will significantly reduce the number of available jobs and whether a basic income could help prevent or alleviate such problems by allowing everyone to benefit from a society's wealth, as well as whether a UBI could be a stepping stone to a resource-based or post-scarcity economy.


== History ==


=== Antiquity ===

Ancient Egypt had a strong, unified theocratic state that owned key parts of the Egyptian economy, including granaries that dispensed grain to the public during hard times.
In a 46 BC triumph, Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar gave each common Roman citizen 100 denarii. Following his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar's will left 300 sestertii (or 75 denarii) to each citizen. Trajan, emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD, personally gave 650 denarii (equivalent to perhaps US$430 in 2023) to all common Roman citizens who applied.


=== 16th century ===
In his Utopia (1516), English statesman and philosopher Thomas More depicts a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income. In this book, basic income is proposed as an answer to the statement ""No penalty on earth will stop people from stealing, if it's their only way of getting food"", stating:

instead of inflicting these horrible punishments, it would be far more to the point to provide everyone with some means of livelihood, so that nobody's under the frightful necessity of becoming first a thief, and then a corpse.
Spanish scholar Johannes Ludovicus Vives (1492–1540) proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents ""not on the grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity."" Vives also argued that to qualify for poor relief, the recipient must ""deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work.""


=== 18th century ===
English-born American philosopher Thomas Paine authored Common Sense (1776) and The American Crisis (1776–1783), the two most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution. His essay, Agrarian Justice, was published in 1797, In it, he proposed concrete reforms to abolish poverty. In particular, he proposed a universal social insurance system comprising old-age pensions and disability support, and universal stakeholder grants for young adults, funded by a 10% inheritance tax focused on land, it is also considered one of the earliest proposals for a social security system. Thomas Paine summarized his view by stating that ""Men did not make the earth. It is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for the land which he holds."" Paine saw inheritance as being partly a common fund and wanted to supplement the citizen's dividend in a tax on inheritance transfers.
In 1797, English Radical Thomas Spence published The Rights of Infants as a response to Thomas Paine's Agrarian Justice. In this essay Spence proposes the introduction of an unconditional basic income to all members of the community. Such allowance would be financed through the socialization of land and the benefits of the rents received by each municipality. A part of everyone's earnings would be seized by the State, and given to others.


=== 19th century ===
Henry George proposed to create a pension and disability system, and a broad social support system from a single tax on land and natural resource value. Social support would be distributed to residents ""as a right"" instead of as charity. George mentioned, but did not stress, the possibility of direct cash distribution of land rent. His ideas gave rise to the economic philosophy now known as Georgism or the ""single tax movement"", which is an economic ideology holding that, although people should own the value they produce themselves, the economic rent derived from land—including from all natural resources, the commons, and urban locations—should belong equally to all members of society. Some Georgists refer to unconditional basic income funded by the single tax as a citizen's dividend in reference to Thomas Paine's proposal from the 19th Century.


=== Early 20th century ===
Around 1920, support for basic income started growing, primarily in England.
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.
In the United Kingdom at the end of World War I, Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple of the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled ""Scheme for a State Bonus"" (1918) that argued for the ""introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom."" They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.
C. H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system he called social credit, a combination of monetary reform and basic income.
In 1944 and 1945, the Beveridge Committee, led by the British economist William Beveridge, developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance, means-tested benefits, and unconditional allowances for children. Committee member Lady Rhys-Williams argued that the incomes for adults should be more like a basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model. Her son Sir Brandon Rhys-Williams proposed a basic income to a parliamentary committee in 1982, and soon after that in 1984, the Basic Income Research Group, now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust, began to conduct and disseminate research on basic income.


=== Late 20th century ===
Milton Friedman proposed the idea of a negative income tax (NIT), which effectively sanctioned a basic income for all, in his book Capitalism and Freedom published in 1962. In his 1964 State of the Union address, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson introduced legislation to fight the ""war on poverty"". Johnson believed in expanding the federal government's roles in education and health care as poverty reduction strategies. In this political climate, the idea of a guaranteed income for every American also took root. Notably, a document, signed by 1200 economists, called for a guaranteed income for every American. Six ambitious basic income experiments started up on the related concept of negative income tax. Succeeding President Richard Nixon explained its purpose as ""to provide both a safety net for the poor and a financial incentive for welfare recipients to work."" Congress eventually approved a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly and the disabled.
In the mid-1970s the main competitor to basic income and negative income tax, the Earned income tax credit (EITC), or its advocates, won over enough legislators for the US Congress to pass laws on that policy. In 1986, the Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), was founded, with academic conferences every second year. Other advocates included the green political movement, as well as activists and some groups of unemployed people.
In the latter part of the 20th century, discussions were held around automatization and jobless growth, the possibility of combining economic growth with ecologically sustainable development, and how to reform the welfare state bureaucracy. Basic income was interwoven in these and many other debates. During the BIEN academic conferences, there were papers about basic income from a wide variety of perspectives, including economics, sociology, and human rights approaches.


=== 21st century ===

In recent years the idea has come to the forefront more than before. The Swiss referendum about basic income in Switzerland 2016 was covered in media worldwide, despite its rejection. Famous business people like Elon Musk, Pierre Omidyar, and Andrew Yang have lent their support, as have high-profile politicians like Jeremy Corbyn and Tulsi Gabbard. The Institute for Public Policy Research predicted that 59% of tasks currently done by humans could be affected by AI in the next three to five years. Universal basic Income could help fill the gap left by this ""jobs apocalypse.“
In 2019, in California, then-Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs initiated an 18-month pilot program of guaranteed income for 125 residents as part of the privately funded S.E.E.D. project there.
In the 2020 Democratic Party primaries, political newcomer Andrew Yang touted basic income as his core policy. His policy, referred to as a ""Freedom Dividend"", would have provided adult American citizens US$1,000 a month independent of employment status.
On 21 January 2021, in California, the two-year donor-funded Compton Pledge began distributing monthly guaranteed income payments to a ""pre-verified"" pool of low-income residents, in a program gauged for a maximum of 800 recipients, at which point it will be one of the larger among 25 U.S. cities exploring this approach to community economics.
Beginning in December 2021, Tacoma, Washington, piloted ""Growing Resilience in Tacoma"" (GRIT), a guaranteed income initiative that provides $500 a month to 110 families. GRIT is part of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Guaranteed Income Research larger study. A report on the results of the GRIT experiment will be published in 2024.


==== Response to COVID-19 ====
As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, universal basic income and similar proposals such as helicopter money and cash transfers were increasingly discussed across the world. Most countries implemented forms of partial unemployment schemes, which effectively subsidized workers' incomes without a work requirement. Around ninety countries and regions including the United States, Spain, Hong Kong, and Japan introduced temporary direct cash transfer programs to their citizens.
In Europe, a petition calling for an ""emergency basic income"" gathered more than 200,000 signatures, and polls suggested widespread support in public opinion for it. Unlike the various stimulus packages of the US administration, the EU's stimulus plans did not include any form of income-support policies.


== Basic income vs negative income tax ==

The diagram shows a basic income/negative tax system combined with flat income tax (the same percentage in tax for every income level).
Y is here the pre-tax salary given by the employer and y' is the net income.
Negative income tax
For low earnings, there is no income tax in the negative income tax system. They receive money, in the form of a negative income tax, but they do not pay any tax. Then, as their labour income increases, this benefit, this money from the state, gradually decreases. That decrease is to be seen as a mechanism for the poor, instead of the poor paying tax.
Basic income
That is, however, not the case in the corresponding basic income system in the diagram. There everyone typically pays income taxes. But on the other hand, everyone also gets the same amount of basic income.
But the net income is the same
But, as the orange line in the diagram shows, the net income is anyway the same. No matter how much or how little one earns, the amount of money one gets in one's pocket is the same, regardless of which of these two systems are used.
Basic income and negative income tax are generally seen to be similar in economic net effects, but there are some differences:

Psychological. Philip Harvey accepts that ""both systems would have the same redistributive effect and tax earned income at the same marginal rate"" but does not agree that ""the two systems would be perceived by taxpayers as costing the same"".: 15, 13 
Tax profile. Tony Atkinson made a distinction based on whether the tax profile was flat (for basic income) or variable (for NIT).
Timing. Philippe Van Parijs states that ""the economic equivalence between the two programs should not hide the fact that they have different effects on recipients because of the different timing of payments: ex-ante in Basic Income, ex-post in Negative Income Tax"".


== Perspectives and arguments ==


=== Automation ===

One central rationale for basic income is the belief that automation and robotisation could result in technological unemployment, leading to a world with fewer paid jobs. A key question in this context is whether a basic income could help prevent or alleviate such problems by allowing everyone to benefit from a society's wealth, as well as whether a UBI could be a stepping stone to a resource-based or post-scarcity economy.
U.S. presidential candidate and nonprofit founder Andrew Yang has stated that automation caused the loss of 4 million manufacturing jobs and advocated for a UBI (which he calls a Freedom Dividend) of $1,000/month rather than worker retraining programs. Yang has stated that he is heavily influenced by Martin Ford. Ford, in his turn, believes that the emerging technologies will fail to deliver a lot of employment; on the contrary, because the new industries will ""rarely, if ever, be highly labor-intensive"". Similar ideas have been debated many times before in history—that ""the machines will take the jobs""—so the argument is not new. But what is quite new is the existence of several academic studies that do indeed forecast a future with substantially less employment, in the decades to come. Additionally, President Barack Obama has stated that he believes that the growth of artificial intelligence will lead to an increased discussion around the idea of ""unconditional free money for everyone"".


=== Economics and costs ===

Some proponents of UBI have argued that basic income could increase economic growth because it would sustain people while they invest in education to get higher-skilled and well-paid jobs. However, there is also a discussion of basic income within the degrowth movement, which argues against economic growth.
Advocates contend that the guaranteed financial security of a UBI will increase the population's willingness to take risks, which would create a culture of inventiveness and strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit.
The cost of a basic income is one of the biggest questions in the public debate as well as in the research and depends on many things. It first and foremost depends on the level of the basic income as such, and it also depends on many technical points regarding exactly how it is constructed.
While opponents claim that a basic income at an adequate level for all citizens cannot be financed, their supporters propose that it could indeed be financed, with some advocating a strong redistribution and restructuring of bureaucracy and administration for this purpose.
According to statements of American Enterprise Institute-affiliated Libertarian/conservative scholar Charles Murray, recalled and sanctioned in 2016 by the George Gibbs Chair in Political Economy and Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and nationally syndicated columnist Veronique de Rugy, as of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI in the US would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the US system put in place at that date. By 2020, it would have been nearly a trillion dollars cheaper.
American economist Karl Widerquist argues that simply multiplying the amount of the grant by the population would be a naive calculation, as this is the gross costs of UBI and does not take into account that UBI is a system where people pay taxes on a regular basis and receive the grant at the same time.
According to Swiss economist Thomas Straubhaar, the concept of UBI is basically financeable without any problems. He describes it as ""at its core, nothing more than a fundamental tax reform"" that ""bundles all social policy measures into a single instrument, the basic income paid out unconditionally."" He also considers a universal basic income to be socially just, arguing, although all citizens would receive the same amount in the form of the basic income at the beginning of the month, the rich would have lost significantly more money through taxes at the end of the month than they would have received through the basic income, while the opposite is the case for poorer people, similar to the concept of a negative income tax.


=== Inflation of labor and rental costs ===
One of the most common arguments against UBI stems from the upward pressure on prices, in particular for labor and housing rents, which would likely cause inflation. Public policy choices such as rent controls or land value taxation would likely affect the inflationary potential of universal basic income.


=== Work ===
Many critics of basic income argue that people, in general, will work less, which in turn means less tax revenue and less money for the state and local governments. Studies include:

In negative income tax experiments in the United States in 1970 there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for primary earners. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher.
In the Mincome experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba, also in the 1970s, there were slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment. However, the only two groups who worked significantly less were new mothers, and teenagers working to support their families. New mothers spent this time with their infant children, and working teenagers put significant additional time into their schooling.
A 2024 study investigated the impact of $1,000/month UBI over a period of 3 years for 1,000 randomized low-income participants in two U.S. States, which represented an around 40% increase in household income. The study found an income effect with a decrease of non-UBI income by $1,500/year, a decrease in non-UBI household income by 21% of the UBI transfer, a 2% decrease in labor market participation, no significant change in time spent on childcare, no self-reported decrease in barriers to employment, a null result for changes in job quality, an increase in entrepreneurial orientation but no significant change in entrepreneurial activity, while enrollment in tertiary education showed a slight increase for participants below 30 years.
Although it is difficult to know for sure what will happen if a whole country introduces basic income, there are nevertheless some studies who have attempted to look at this question:

A study from 2017 showed no evidence that people worked less because of the Iranian subsidy reform (a basic income reform).
Regarding the question of basic income vs jobs, there is also the aspect of so-called welfare traps. Proponents of basic income often argue that with a basic income, unattractive jobs would necessarily have to be better paid and their working conditions improved, so that people still do them without need, reducing these traps.


=== Philosophy and morality ===

By definition, universal basic income does not make a distinction between ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"" individuals when making payments. Opponents argue that this lack of discrimination is unfair: ""Those who genuinely choose idleness or unproductive activities cannot expect those who have committed to doing productive work to subsidize their livelihood. Responsibility is central to fairness.""
Proponents usually view UBI as a fundamental human right that enables an adequate standard of living which every citizen should have access to in modern society. It would be a kind of foundation guaranteed for everyone, on which one could build and never fall below that subsistence level.
It is also argued that this lack of discrimination between those who supposedly deserve it and those who do not is a way to reduce social stigma.
In addition, proponents of UBI may argue that the ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"" categories are a superficial classification, as people who are not in regular gainful employment also contribute to society, e.g. by raising children, caring for people, or doing other value-creating activities which are not institutionalized. UBI would provide a balance here and thus overcomes a concept of work that is reduced to pure gainful employment and disregards sideline activities too much.


=== Health and poverty ===
The first comprehensive systematic review of the health impact of basic income (or rather unconditional cash transfers in general) in low- and middle-income countries, a study that included 21 studies of which 16 were randomized controlled trials, found a clinically meaningful reduction in the likelihood of being sick by an estimated 27%. Unconditional cash transfers, according to the study, may also improve food security and dietary diversity. Children in recipient families are also more likely to attend school and the cash transfers may increase money spent on health care. A 2022 update of this landmark review confirmed these findings based on a grown body of evidence (35 studies, the majority being large randomized controlled trials) and additionally found sufficient evidence that unconditional cash transfers also reduce the likelihood of living in extreme poverty.
The Canadian Medical Association passed a motion in 2015 in clear support of basic income and for basic income trials in Canada.

== Pilot programs and experiments ==

Since the 1960s, but in particular since the late 2000s, several pilot programs and experiments on basic income have been conducted around the world. Some examples include:


=== 1960s−1970s ===
Experiments with negative income tax in the United States and Canada in the 1960s and 1970s.
The province of Manitoba, Canada experimented with Mincome, a basic guaranteed income, in the 1970s. In the town of Dauphin, Manitoba, labor only decreased by 13%, much less than expected. This program was ended after issues with the cost becoming unsustainable started to arise.


=== 2000−2009 ===
The basic income grant in Namibia launched in 2008 and ended in 2009.
An independent pilot implemented in São Paulo, Brazil launched in 2009.


=== 2010−2019 ===
Basic income trials run in 2011–2012 in several villages in India, whose government has proposed a guaranteed basic income for all citizens. It was found that basic income in the region raised the education rate of young people by 25%.
Iran became the first country to introduce a system of UBI in December 2010. It was paid to all citizens and replaced the gasoline subsidies, electricity, and some food products, that the country applied for years to reduce inequalities and poverty. The sum corresponded in 2012 to approximately US$40 per person per month, US$480 per year for a single person, and US$2,300 for a family of five people.
In Spain, the ingreso mínimo vital, the income guarantee system, is an economic benefit guaranteed by the social security in Spain, but in 2016 was considered in need of reform.
In South Korea the Youth Allowance Program was started in 2016 in the City of Seongnam, which would give every 24-year-old citizen 250,000 won (~US$215) every quarter in the form of a ""local currency"" that could only be used in local businesses. This program was later expanded to the entire province of Gyeonggi in 2018.
The GiveDirectly experiment in a disadvantaged village of Nairobi, Kenya, benefitting over 20,000 people living in rural Kenya, is the longest-running basic income pilot as of November 2017, which is set to run for 12 years.
A project called Eight in a village in Fort Portal, Uganda, that a nonprofit organization launched in January 2017, which provides income for 56 adults and 88 children through mobile money.
A two-year pilot the Finnish government began in January 2017 which involved 2,000 subjects In April 2018, the Finnish government rejected a request for funds to extend and expand the program from Kela (Finland's social security agency).
An experiment in the city of Utrecht, Netherlands launched in early 2017, that is testing different rates of aid.
A three-year basic income pilot that the Ontario provincial government, Canada, launched in the cities of Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay in July 2017. Although called basic income, it was only made available to those with a low income and funding would be removed if they obtained employment, making it more related to the current welfare system than true basic income. The pilot project was canceled on 31 July 2018 by the newly elected Progressive Conservative government under Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
In Israel, in 2018 a non-profit initiative GoodDollar started with an objective to build a global economic framework for providing universal, sustainable, and scalable basic income through the new digital asset technology of blockchain. The non-profit aims to launch a peer-to-peer money transfer network in which money can be distributed to those most in need, regardless of their location, based on the principles of UBI. The project raised US$1 million from a financial company.
The Rythu Bandhu scheme is a welfare scheme started in the state of Telangana, India, in May 2018, aimed at helping farmers. Each farm owner receives 4,000 INR per acre twice a year for rabi and kharif harvests. To finance the program a budget allocation of 120 billion INR (US$1.55 Billion as of May 2022) was made in the 2018–2019 state budget.


=== 2020−present ===
Swiss non-profit Social Income started paying out basic incomes in the form of mobile money in 2020 to people in need in Sierra Leone. Contributions finance the international initiative from people worldwide, who donate 1% of their monthly paychecks.
In May 2020, Spain introduced a minimum basic income, reaching about 2% of the population, in response to COVID-19 in order to ""fight a spike in poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic"". It was expected to cost state coffers three billion euros ($3.5 billion) a year.""
In August 2020, a project in Germany started that gives a €1,200 monthly basic income in a lottery system to citizens who applied online. The crowdsourced project lasted three years and be compared against 1,380 people who do not receive basic income. When the project was finished in August 2023, Mein Grundeinkommen calculated that a tax-financed universal basic income of €1,200 per month could be financed for every adult in Germany that would make 80% of adults better off.
In October 2020, HudsonUP was launched in Hudson, New York, by The Spark of Hudson and Humanity Forward Foundation to give $500 monthly basic income to 25 residents. It will last five years and be compared against 50 people who are not receiving basic income.
In May 2021, the government of Wales, which has devolved powers in matters of Social Welfare within the UK, announced the trialling of a universal basic income scheme to ""see whether the promises that basic income holds out are genuinely delivered"". From July 2022 over 500 people leaving care in Wales were offered £1600 per month in a 3-year £20 million pilot scheme, to evaluate the effect on the lives of those involved in the hope of providing independence and security to people.
In July 2022, Chicago began a year-long guaranteed income program by sending $500 a month to 5,000 households for one year in a lottery system to citizens who applied online. A similar program was launched in late 2022 by Cook County, Illinois (which encompasses the entirety of Chicago as well as several suburbs) which sent monthly $500 payments to 3,250 residents with a household income at or below 250% of the federal poverty level for two years.
In June 2023, The Guardian reported that a universal basic income of £1,600 a month is to be trialled in two places in England – Jarrow and East Finchley.


== Payments with similarities ==


=== Alaska Permanent Fund ===

The Permanent Fund of Alaska in the United States provides a kind of yearly basic income based on the oil and gas revenues of the state to nearly all state residents. More precisely the fund resembles a sovereign wealth fund, investing resource revenues into bonds, stocks, and other conservative investment options with the intent to generate renewable revenue for future generations. The fund has had a noticeable yet diminishing effect on reducing poverty among rural Alaska Indigenous people, notably in the elderly population. However, the payment is not high enough to cover basic expenses, averaging $1,600 annually per resident in 2019 currency (As of 2019 it has never exceeded $2,100), and is not a fixed, guaranteed amount. For these reasons, it is not always considered a basic income. However, some consider it to be the only example of a real basic income.

Bas-relief,"Bas-relief is a type of relief (sculpture) that has less depth to the faces and figures than they actually have, when measured proportionately (to scale).  This technique keeps the natural shapes of the figures and allows the work to be seen from many angles without twisting the figures themselves. 
There is a continuation of the bas-relief technique into the next category, altorilievo, or high relief. High relief makes deeper images than bas-relief. Instead of shallow backgrounds that are a few inches (cm) deep at most, they can be up to several feet (a few meters) deep in altorilievo. 
Some of the best examples of bas-relief are the Assyrian Lion Hunt Reliefs, which are housed at the British Museum. The attention to detail and appearance of the lions moving make them stand out, especially for the time period they were made in.

Windward slope,"The windward slope is the side of a mountain, island or other land which the wind hits. The windward direction is the direction upwind from the point of reference.  That means windward is the direction from which the wind is coming.  If the wind is moving from north to south, then the windward slope is the north side of the hill or mountain.  
Leeward is the direction downwind from the point of reference.  The leeward side of a mountain is usually drier than the windward side.

Breastmilk medicine,"Breastmilk medicine refers to the non-nutritional usage of human breast milk (HBM) as a medicine or therapy to cure diseases. Breastmilk is perceived as an important food that provides essential nutrition to infants. It also provides protection in terms of immunity by direct transfer of antibodies from mothers to infants. The immunity developed via this mean protects infants from diseases such as respiratory diseases, middle ear infections, and gastrointestinal diseases. HBM can also produce lifelong positive therapeutic effects on a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmunity, and asthma.
Therapeutic use of breastmilk has long been a part of natural pharmacopeia, and ethnomedicine. The effectiveness of HBM and fresh colostrum as a treatment for inflammatory disorders such as rhinitis, skin infection, soring nipples, and conjunctivitis has been reported by public health nurses. Currently, many breastmilk components have shown therapeutic benefits in preclinical studies and are being evaluated by clinical studies.


== Anti-inflammatory effects ==
HBM can be used to treat inflammations. Breastfeeding has an anti-inflammatory effect that is conveyed by its chemical components’ interaction with body cells. The major chemical component that produces the anti-inflammatory effect in both colostrum and transitional milk are glycoprotein and lactoferrin. Lactoferrin has multiple actions including lymph-stimulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal effects.  The anti-inflammatory effects of lactoferrin are attributed to its iron-binding properties, inhibition of inflammation-causing molecules including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), stimulation of the activity and maturation of lymphocytes as well as preservation of an antioxidant environment.  Besides, lactoferrin protects infants against bacterial and fungal infections in combination with other peptides present in HBM.


=== Respiratory viral infection in infants ===
Lactoferrin in HBM can also inhibit the invasion and proliferation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is a virus commonly found in the human respiratory tract and causes mild cold-like symptoms.  Lactoferrin can interact directly with the F glycoprotein which is a protein on the surface of the virus that is responsible for presenting the virus to body cells and causing infections.

Adenovirus is another group of viruses that targets the mucosal membrane of the human respiratory tract. It usually causes mild to severe infection with symptoms like the common cold or flu.  Lactoferrin can prevent infection of adenovirus since it can interfere with the primary receptors of the virus. HBM regurgitation into the nose after breastfeeding is a way to eliminate these mucosal bacteria and protect infants against recurring nose infections in breastfed infants in the long term.


=== Skin Problems: atopic eczema and diaper dermatitis ===
Atopic eczema is an inflammatory disorder that occurs in the outermost skin layer called the epidermis. This skin disorder affects 50% of infants in the first year after birth. Infants suffering from atopic eczema are characterized by intense itching, redness, and crusting in their skin. Skin thickening may result in chronic or sub-acute patients due to scratching and fissuring over time.
One of the commonly used medications for atopic eczema is non-prescription cream containing an anti-inflammatory agent 1% hydrocortisone. On the other hand, applying HBM on the skin as ointments is therapeutically beneficial to infants with mild to moderate atopic eczema. It is evidenced that, compared to 1% hydrocortisone, HBM has similar effectiveness as 1% hydrocortisone to relieve infants’ inflaming skin conditions. 

Diaper dermatitis is another prevalent infant dermatological disorder. Common clinical features of diaper dermatitis include inflamed, itchy, tender skin and soreness in the diaper area. Study results have shown that human breastmilk is highly effective in healing diaper rash.
There is much evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of HBM. The immunological components in HBM help strengthen the baby’s immune system. These immunological components include antimicrobial proteins that can inhibit or kill a wide range of pathogens whose invasion may lead to an inflammatory response. This antimicrobial effect could be achieved by indirectly creating an unfavorable environment for the growth of pathogens by modifying commensal flora, pH, or level of bacterial substrates. The antimicrobial effect is also brought by an antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA) which is the prenominal immunoglobulin present in HBM that can protect infants from a variety of skin infections.


=== Nipple problems: sore nipples ===
The painful nipple is a common difficulty confronted by mothers who decided to carry out breastfeeding. Topical application of expressed breastmilk has long been a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce nipple pain. According to the research outcome of many studies, topical application of HBM can help reduce the perception of nipple pain in a treatment course of 4 to 5 days. It is also stated that HBM is more effective in lowering pain perception than Lanolin.
However, another study indicates that Lanolin produces lower pain levels in mothers with nipple pain than HBM. This study stated that lanolin shows a better therapeutic effect for healing rates, nipple trauma, and nipple pain. Although lanolin may be more efficacious than HBM to cure nipple problems, HBM is not proven to be ineffective to treat nipple pain. Considering HBM is more easily available than Lanolin, it is still useful for treating nipple problems in a practical sense.


=== Eye Problems ===


==== Traditional uses ====

The topical application of breastmilk as a treatment for an infectious disease called conjunctivitis has been present since ancient times in different nations such as ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece, etc. HBM was also recommended by the Greek physician Galen as a remedy for conjunctivitis. Physicians in early modern England recommended human milk for conditions ranging from mild symptoms such as soreness to even blindness. Healers in that era even believed that a mixture of HBM with other components could restore eyesight.


==== Scientific findings ====
Evidence from clinical research has shown that applying HBM can prevent people from getting conjunctivitis infections.
Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection. Besides sex-borne transmission, it can also be transmitted to babies during childbirth. This infectious disease can cause neonatal conjunctivitis, which could lead to blindness, if untreated. Hospitals in the United States are required to apply antibiotics to the eyes of new-born within one hour of childbirth to prevent the development of conjunctivitis. This is because certain bacteria in HBM are found to be effective against gonorrhea bacteria and may serve as a convenient and readily available substitute for antibiotics in places where antibiotics are not widely available.


== Breastmilk in umbilical cord care ==

After labor in childbirth, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, and part of it stays in contact with the infant. The remaining part of the umbilical cord dries out and eventually separates after 5–15 days. In taking care of the umbilical cord, the dry care method involving soap and water is recommended by the WHO and many national health organizations. For the use of HBM in umbilical cord care, clinical studies found that topical application of breast milk will lead to a shorter time of cord separation than other methods including ethanol and dry cord care.


== Anti tumoricidal and anti-bacterial effects ==
Human alpha-lactalbumin is a natural protein component of HBM. It can be extracted by chromatography from breast milk. It complexes with oleic acid to form a protein called the “human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells” (HAMLET). The HAMLET complex induces apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells. In in vitro and animal model studies, HAMLET has shown preventative and therapeutic effects in reducing and controlling tumor growth. The physiological effects of HAMLET may explain the proposal that breastfeeding has protective effects for mothers and children against cancer, as shown by the association length of breastfeeding and childhood cancer incidence. The HAMLET has also been found to have anti-bacterial effects through the inhibition of enzymes in glycolysis.


== Role in society ==
Researchers’ interest in HBM is led by the discovery of a number of chemical components in HBM. These components include growth factors, cytokines, and a heterogeneous population of cells which are stem cells, probiotic bacteria, and the HAMLET complex.
By considering the easy accessibility of HBM and high prevalence of infant inflammation disorders, breastmilk may be a cheap and convenient ways to relieve inflammatory symptoms. The prophylactic antibiotic use of human milk may be important in areas where mothers and infants do not have easy access to medicine, such as people living in developing countries. Under these circumstances, practice of HBM therapy as medicine will be a determining factor in infant recovery and survival.


== General limitations ==


=== Breastfeeding difficulties ===
Breastfeeding may not be feasible and easy for some mothers due to psychological or physiological reasons. For instance, breastfeeding self-efficacy, the mother's confidence in her breastfeeding abilities, is positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding while postpartum depression makes it more difficult to breastfeed.  Mothers who have undergone breast surgeries such as mastectomy may have reduced capabilities of HBM production.


=== Suitability of breastmilk ===
For some individuals, HBM may not be suitable for use, as it may transmit of viruses and other pathogens to infants. For instance, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and bacterial infections from the mother may be transmitted through HBM, causing complications for infants.


=== Evaluation of medical effectiveness of breastmilk ===
There is difficulty in the generalization of study results in evidence-based practice due to inconsistencies in the clinical study findings on breastfeeding medicine. HBM compositions are diverse among different individuals, or the same individual at various times. It is influenced by factors such as maternal diet and changes at various times after pregnancy. For instance, protein composition in HBM is higher in the earlier stages of lactation. Gradually, the mother produces more mature milk, which is whiter in color, compared to the yellowish colostrum. These changes may affect the effectiveness of HBM in medical use.

Fire triangle,"The fire triangle is used to show the rule that a fire needs three things to burn. These things are heat, fuel, and oxygen. If one of these three is removed, the fire will be put out. In the middle of the fire triangle there is also a chemical reaction.
Without heat, a fire cannot begin. If fire becomes cool enough, it will not keep burning. Heat can be removed by using water. This only works on some types of fire. Separating burning fuels from each other can also reduce the heat. In forest fires, burning logs are separated and placed into safe areas where there is no other fuel. Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the heat source, but other fuels may have caught fire. They will continue burning until the firefighters deal with them and their fire triangles. Without oxygen, a fire can not start. Oxygen may be removed from a fire by covering it in some way. Some foams and heavy gases (for example, carbon dioxide) are often used for this. The fire can also be closed off away from a source of oxygen. Once all the oxygen in the closed off area is used by the fire, it will go out if it cannot get more oxygen because it needs oxygen. And can be used",0
Philosophical theology,"Philosophical theology is both a branch and form of theology in which philosophical methods are used in developing or analyzing theological concepts. It therefore includes natural theology as well as philosophical treatments of orthodox and heterodox theology. Philosophical theology is also closely related to the philosophy of religion.


== Definitions ==
Mortimer J. Adler distinguishes philosophical theology from natural theology. While the former is, according to him, theology done by non-Christian philosophers, the latter is done by those who are already Christians and are actually trying to find rational proofs for their faith. Adler thinks that the term ""natural theology"" is a misnomer and is actually apologetics, and cites as an example Thomas Aquinas' Summa Contra Gentiles, addressed to the Jews and Moors in Spain. Though written as if it were philosophical theology, was in fact, apologetics and not philosophical theology, as it was written by a Christian and not by a pagan. In Adler's view, few books on natural theology are sound works of philosophical theology because they are not written by pagans. An example of philosophical theology, according to Adler, is Aristotle's theology as found in his Metaphysics.
Contrary to Adler's view, Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister think that doing philosophical theology may not be restricted by whether the doer is an insider to faith or not, for anyone doing philosophical theology only tries to consider whether a theological doctrine can make philosophical sense or not. But, as Adler points it out, a pagan doing philosophical theology and coming to a theological conclusion has a different route than an insider using philosophy to examine or seek to understand his faith.


== Philosophy and theology ==
The relationship between theology and philosophy has been long-debated and discussed within the Christian tradition. Tertullian, an influential early Christian theologian and apologist, believed that philosophy has little to do with theology, arguing that the use of philosophy often corrupted theology, leading to unorthodox beliefs that were not grounded in the early Christian tradition. He famously asked the question 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'. (Athens symbolized the philosophical approach because of its role as a leading center of Hellenistic philosophy, while Jerusalem represented Christianity because of its role as an important location and intellectual centre in the early church.) 
Other leaders, however, saw a closer relationship between philosophy and theology. Justin Martyr looked at people like Heraclitus and Socrates as possessing the divine light of revelation and believed them to be true philosophers. Justin saw Christianity as the True Philosophy and argued for Christianity using philosophical methods and terminology. St. Augustine, who became one of the most influential theologians in history and whose works laid the foundation for much of Western philosophy (as well as much of Western theology), espoused a more middle-of-the-road, moderate approach. He argued that philosophy and theology often complement each other while at the same time cautioning that philosophy should not always be used in theological discourse. Instead, he argued, one should make sure that a philosophical approach toward a particular issue was grounded in prior Christian commitments.
The disciplines of Philosophy and Theology have often been connected, with theologians and philosophers interacting and debating similar and sometimes overlapping issues. Philosophy played a key role in the formation of Western theology. Thomas Aquinas, one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in history, for instance, borrowed much of his concepts from Aristotle. Scholasticism dominated both the philosophical and theological landscape in the Middle Ages, with theologians such as Aquinas, Anselm of Canterbury, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Peter Abelard, Bonaventure, and Albertus Magnus playing key roles in both philosophy and theology.
In modern times, Anthony Thiselton has shown in his Fusion of Horizons the role that philosophy has played in the interpretation of scriptures, i.e., in the field of hermeneutics. Philosophy provides interpretive grids for the apprehension of revelation. There are others, like Sadhu Sundar Singh, for instance, who believe that it is the illumination of the Holy Spirit that gives the truest meaning of revelation. Yet, one can't fail to see that cultural grids play an important role in the development of theology.
Many contemporary philosophers continue to write and argue from a Christian perspective, with Christian concepts undergirding their philosophical work. In recent decades, some of the most well-known philosophers who have written from a Christian perspective are Alvin Plantinga, Alasdair MacIntyre, William Lane Craig, Jean-Luc Marion, Paul Tillich, Charles Taylor, Richard Swinburne, and James K. A. Smith.


== Foundations of modern philosophical theology ==
During the 18th, 19th centuries, and 20th centuries, many theologians reacted against the modernist, Enlightenment, and positivist attacks on Christian theology. Some existentialistic or neo-orthodox Protestant intellectuals like the Swiss Reformed theologian Karl Barth turned away from philosophy (called fideism) and argued that faith should be based strictly upon divine revelation. A popular approach in some circles is the approach of Reformed epistemologists, such as Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, who assert that belief in God might be foundational (or, properly 'basic') and warranted without the need for logical or evidential justification, like belief in other minds or the external world, rather than inferentially derived from other beliefs. It can, however, be subject to defeaters, rationally requiring that one give up the belief. Many other philosophers and theologians, however, disagree with this perspective and provide alternative views. Many other theologians have turned to continental philosophy, analytic philosophy, and postmodern philosophy in attempts to analyze and reframe Christian theology in contemporary contexts.


== Philosophical theology ==
While philosophical theology can denote an approach to theology which is philosophical in nature, it can also denote a specific area of theology in which philosophical methods and terminology are used to analyze theological concepts. One task of philosophical theologians is to attempt to reconcile certain aspects of Christian doctrine with developments in philosophy. One question concerns how to prove the existence and nature of God. The knowledge of God is dealt with in the epistemology of religion, usually a subset of philosophy of religion. 
There are many different perspectives with philosophical theology on such questions. In modern times process theology, open theism, and Christian panentheism have tried to look at God as the Being who is not only the Source and Ground of all beings but also influenced by the people and processes of the world which he created and which he belongs—rejecting or at least amending the classical medieval doctrine of impassibility.


== Christology ==
Christology raises a number of philosophical questions, such as how the divine can incarnate as a human, how the eternal can enter the temporal, and how the divine and the human can be united in one yet remain distinct. Such questions led to earlier heresies like Arianism, Sabellianism, Docetism, etc. Often, one's epistemic theory can play an important role in how one answers such questions. There is, for instance, sometimes a clash between those who want to emphasize the rational foundation for theology and those who want to emphasize the empirical foundation for theology. There has also been a contrast made between Christology from above and Christology from below. The former emphasizes the divine side of Christ; the latter, the human side. The human side obviously tends to look at it more empirically. The Scriptures call the Incarnation a mystery of godliness. It baffles human imagination, leading many to call it a divine mystery. Yet, philosophical theologians argue that it is also important to find a philosophical ground for asserting both the divinity and humanity of Christ.
Other theologians, however, like Rudolph Bultmann, read the New Testament documents in mythic terms which needed to be stripped back so that the essential truths could be laid bare, a hermeneutical approach they called demythologization. This included a clear distinction between the (in their view, unimportant) Jesus of history and the (all-important) Christ of faith (see also the Quest for the Historical Jesus).

Fossil wood,"Fossil wood, also known as fossilized tree, is wood that is preserved in the fossil record.  Over time the wood will usually be the part of a plant that is best preserved (and most easily found).  Fossil wood may or may not be petrified, in which case it is known as petrified wood or petrified tree. The study of fossil wood is sometimes called palaeoxylology, with a ""palaeoxylologist"" somebody who studies fossil wood.
The fossil wood may be the only part of the plant that has been preserved, with the rest of the plant completely unknown: therefore such wood may get a special kind of botanical name. This will usually include ""xylon"" and a term indicating its presumed (not necessarily certain) affinity, such as Araucarioxylon (wood similar to that of extant Araucaria or some related genus like Agathis or Wollemia), Palmoxylon (wood similar to that of modern Arecaeae), or Castanoxylon (wood similar to that of modern chinkapin or chestnut tree).


== Types ==


=== Petrified wood ===

Petrified wood are fossils of wood that have turned to stone through the process of permineralization. All organic materials are replaced with minerals while maintaining the original structure of the wood.
The most notable example is the petrified forest in Arizona.


=== Mummified wood ===
Mummified wood are fossils of wood that have not permineralized. They are formed when trees are buried rapidly in dry cold or hot environments. They are valued in paleobotany because they retain original cells and tissues capable of being examined with the same techniques used with extant plants in dendrology.
Notable examples include the mummified forests in Ellesmere Island and Axel Heiberg Island.


=== Submerged forests ===

Submerged forests are remains of trees submerged by marine transgression. They are important in determining sea level rise since the last glacial period.

Exometeorology,"Exometeorology is the study of atmospheric conditions of exoplanets and other non-stellar celestial bodies outside the Solar System, such as brown dwarfs. The diversity of possible sizes, compositions, and temperatures for exoplanets (and brown dwarfs) leads to a similar diversity of theorized atmospheric conditions. However, exoplanet detection technology has only recently developed enough to allow direct observation of exoplanet atmospheres, so there is currently very little observational data about meteorological variations in those atmospheres.


== Observational and theoretical foundations ==


=== Modeling and theoretical foundations ===
Climate models have been used to study Earth's climate since the 1960s and other planets in our solar system since the 1990s. Once exoplanets were discovered, those same models were used to investigate the climates of planets such as Proxima Centauri b and the now-refuted Gliese 581g. These studies simulated what atmospheric pressures and compositions are necessary to maintain liquid water on each terrestrial exoplanet's surface, given their orbital distances and rotation periods. Climate models have also been used to study the possible atmospheres of the Hot Jupiter HD 209458b, the Hot Neptune GJ 1214b, and Kepler-1649b, a theorized Venus analog.
These models assume that the exoplanet in question has an atmosphere in order to determine its climate. Without an atmosphere, the only temperature variations on the planet's surface would be due to insolation from its star. Additionally, the main causes of weather - air pressure and air temperature differences which drive winds and the motion of air masses - can only exist in an environment with a significant atmosphere, as opposed to a tenuous and, consequently, rather static atmosphere, like that of Mercury. Thus, the existence of exometeorological weather (as opposed to space weather) on an exoplanet depends on whether it has an atmosphere at all.


=== Recent discoveries and observational foundations ===
The first exoplanet atmosphere ever observed was that of HD 209458b, a Hot Jupiter orbiting a G-type star similar in size and mass to our sun. Its atmosphere was discovered by spectroscopy; as the planet transited its star, its atmosphere absorbed some of the star's light according to the detectable absorption spectrum of sodium in the planet's atmosphere. While the presence of sodium was later refuted, that discovery paved the way for many other exoplanet atmospheres to be observed and measured. Recently, terrestrial exoplanets have had their atmospheres observed; in 2017, astronomers using a telescope at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile found an atmosphere on earth-sized exoplanet Gliese 1132 b.
However, measuring traditional meteorological variations in an exoplanet's atmosphere — such as precipitation or cloud coverage — is more difficult than observing just the atmosphere, due to the limited resolutions of current telescopes. That said, some exoplanets have shown atmospheric variations when observed at different times and other evidence of active weather. For example, an international team of astronomers in 2012 observed variations in hydrogen escape speeds from the atmosphere of HD 189733 b using the Hubble Space Telescope. Additionally, HD 189733 b and Tau Boötis Ab have their hottest surface temperatures displaced eastward from their subsolar points, which is only possible if those tidally-locked planets have strong winds displacing the heated air eastward, i.e. a westerly wind. Lastly, computer simulations of HD 80606b predict that the sudden increase in insolation it receives at periastron spawns shockwave-like windstorms that reverberate around the planet and distribute the sudden heat influx.


== Theorized weather ==

Empirical observations of weather on exoplanets are still rudimentary, due to the limited resolutions of current telescopes. What little atmospheric variations can be observed usually relate to wind, such as variations in the escape speeds of atmospheric hydrogen in HD 189733b or just the speeds of globally circulating winds on that same planet. However, a number of other observable, non-meteorological properties of exoplanets factor into what exoweather is theorized to occur on their surfaces; some of these properties are listed below.


=== Presence of an atmosphere ===
As mentioned previously, exometeorology requires that an exoplanet has an atmosphere. Some exoplanets that do not currently have atmospheres began with one; however, these likely lost their primordial atmospheres due to atmospheric escape from stellar insolation and stellar flares or lost them due to giant impacts stripping the exoplanet's atmosphere.
Some exoplanets, specifically lava planets, might have partial atmospheres with unique meteorological patterns. Tidally-locked lava worlds receive so much stellar insolation that some molten crust vaporizes and forms an atmosphere on the day side of the planet. Strong winds attempt to carry this new atmosphere to the night side of the planet; however, the vaporized atmosphere cools as it nears the planet's night side and precipitates back down to the surface, essentially collapsing once it reaches the terminator. This effect has been modeled based on data from transits of K2-141b as well as CoRoT-7b, Kepler-10b, and 55 Cancri e. This unusual pattern of crustal evaporation, kilometer-per-second winds, and atmospheric collapse through precipitation might be provable with observations by advanced telescopes like Webb.
Exoplanets with full atmospheres are able to have diverse ranges of weather conditions, similar to weather on the terrestrial planets and gas giants of our Solar System. Planet-wide atmospheres allow for global air circulation, stellar thermal energy distribution, and relatively fast chemical cycling, as seen in the crustal material transportation by lava worlds' partial atmospheres and Earth's own water and carbon cycles. This ability to cycle and globally distribute matter and energy can drive iron rain on hot Jupiters, 2 km/s (4,500 mph) super-rotating winds on HD 189733b, and atmospheric precipitation and collapse on tidally-locked worlds.


=== Orbital properties ===
One of the most important factors determining an exoplanet's properties is its orbital period, or its average distance from its star. This alone determines a planet's effective temperature (the baseline temperature without added insulation from an atmosphere) and how likely the planet is to be tidally locked. These, in turn, can affect what chemical compositions of clouds can be present in a planet's atmosphere, the general motion of heat transfer and atmospheric circulation, and the locations where weather can occur (as with tidally-locked lava worlds with partial atmospheres).
For example, a gas giant's orbital period can determine whether its wind patterns are primarily advective (heat and air flowing from the top of the star-heated atmosphere to the bottom) or convective (heat and air flowing from down near the gradually contracting planet's core up through the atmosphere). If a gas giant's atmosphere receives more heat from insolation than the planet's unending gravitational contraction, then it will have advective circulation patterns; if the opposite heat source is stronger, it will have convective circulation patterns, as Jupiter exhibits.
Additionally, an exoplanet's average incident stellar radiation, determined by its orbital period, can determine what types of chemical cycling an exoplanet might have. Earth's water cycle occurs because our planet's average temperature is close enough to water's triple point (at normal atmospheric pressures) that the planet's surface can sustain three phases of the chemical; similar cycling is theorized for Titan, as its surface temperature and pressure is close to methane's triple point.
Similarly, an exoplanet's orbital eccentricity – how elliptical the planet's orbit is – can affect the incident stellar radiation it receives at different points in its orbit, and thus, can affect its meteorology. An extreme example of this is HD 80606b's shockwave-like storms that occur whenever the planet reaches the innermost point in its extremely eccentric orbit. The difference in distance between its apastron (analogous to Earth's aphelion) and its periastron (perihelion) is so large that the planet's effective temperature varies greatly throughout its orbit. A less extreme example is eccentricity in a terrestrial exoplanet's orbit. If the rocky planet orbits a dim red dwarf star, slight eccentricities can lead to effective temperature variations large enough to collapse the planet's atmosphere, given the right atmospheric compositions, temperatures, and pressures.

Home directory,"In computing, a home directory is a special directory (or location in the File system, Apple calls directories folders). Very often, there is one such home directory per user. Some users, which were created by the system and usually do not log in, do not have such a home directory.
A home directory is used to store personal files of the respective user, including written documents and settings for programs.

Bird's eye figure,"Bird's eye is a type of figure that occurs within several kinds of wood, most notably hard maple. It has a distinctive pattern that resembles tiny, swirling eyes disrupting the smooth lines of grain. It is somewhat reminiscent of a burl, but it is quite different: the small knots that make the burl are missing.
It is not known what causes the phenomenon. Research into the cultivation of bird's eye maple has so far discounted the theories that it is caused by pecking birds deforming the wood grain or that an infecting fungus makes it twist. However, no one has demonstrated a complete understanding of any combination of climate, soil, tree variety, insects, viruses, or genetic mutations that may produce the effect.
Bird's eye maple is most often found in Acer saccharum (sugar maple), but millers also find bird's eye figures in red maple, white ash, Cuban mahogany, American beech, black walnut, and yellow birch. Trees that grow in the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States yield the greatest supply, along with some varieties in the Rocky Mountains. It is not uncommon in Huon Pine, which grows only in Tasmania. Although a tree's bark may offer a few clues that indicate the lumber might have bird's eye figure, felling the tree and cutting it apart is necessary to know for sure.


== Characteristics ==
In most characteristics, wood with bird's eye figure is no different from the rest of the wood from the same tree. Depending on the frequency and radius of the birdseye swirls, each 1⁄8 to 3⁄8 inch (0.32 to 0.95 cm) wide, the wood may be extremely valuable. While woodworkers prize the timber primarily for its use in veneers, it also turns well on a lathe, allowing it to be shaped into decorative canes, chair legs, and handles.


== Uses ==
Bird's eye maple may be expensive, up to several times the cost of ordinary hardwood. It is used in refined specialty products, such as in automobile trim, both in solid form and veneer, boxes and bowls for jewelry, thin veneer, humidors, canes, furniture inlays, handles, guitars, bowed instruments, custom rifle stocks and pool cues are popular uses. Items made with this wood tend to be more expensive not only because the wood is more costly but because it is harder to work.  When working with bird's eye wood, it is advisable to take care in what tools are used, so as to prevent grain tearout. Also the more ""eyes"" lumber has, the weaker the wood tends to be.

Quilt maple,"Quilt or quilted maple refers to a type of figure in maple wood. It is seen on the tangential plane (flat-sawn) and looks like a wavy ""quilted"" pattern, often similar to ripples on water. The highest quality quilted figure is found in the Western Big Leaf species of maple. It is a distortion of the grain pattern itself. Prized for its beauty, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of musical instruments, especially guitars.

Presentation software,"A presentation software is a computer software package used to show information, normally in the form of a slide show. It mostly includes three major functions: an editor that allows text to be inserted and formatted, a method for inserting and manipulating graphic images and a slide-show system to display the content.
The most commonly known presentation program is Microsoft PowerPoint, but there are alternatives such as LibreOffice Impress, Apple's Keynote, LaTeX Beamer and WPS Office (Free and complete office suite, includes writer, spreadsheet, presentations, enjoys the features of small-size, easy-to-use and compatible, covering multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, Android, iOS and Mac).
Originally these programs were used to generate 35 mm slides, to be presented using a slide projector. As these programs became more common in the late 1980s, several companies set up services that would accept the shows on floppy disk and create slides or print transparencies. In the 1990s, dedicated LCD-based screens that could be placed on the projectors started to replace the transparencies, and by the late 1990s they had almost all been replaced by video projectors.

Text to speech,"Text to speech (TTS) is the use of software to create a sound output in the form of a spoken voice. The program that is used by programs to change text on the page to an audio output of the spoken voice is normally a text to speech engine. Blind people, people who do not see well, and people with reading disabililties can rely on good text-to-speech systems. That way they can listen to pieces of the text. TTS engines are needed for an audio output of machine translation results.
Up until about 2010, there was the analytic approach: This approach uses multiply steps to convert the text to speech. Usually, an input text is transformed into phonetic writing. This says how the words are pronounced, and not how they are written. In the phonetic writing, phonemes can be identified. The system can then produce speech by putting together prerecorded or synthesized diphones. A problem is to make the language flow sound natural, what linguists call prosody. 
As of 2022, deep learning is used. To get a good result, neural networks are trained with many good samples. 
Historically, the first systems for speech synthesis used formants. Industrial Systems today, mostly use signal processing.


== History ==

Long before there was electronic signal processing, people tried to build machines that were capable of producing human speech. Gerbert of Aurillac (the future Pope Sylvester II) is said to have constructed a talking head which was able to say yes, and no, in the year 1003. Albertus Mahnus (1198–1280) and Roger Bacon (1219–1294) are also said to have constructed machines, but no records survive. Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein (1723-1795) built a machine in 1779, that was able to produce long vocals (a,e,i,o,u). He used modified organ pipes for his machine. The machine was called speech organ. Wolfgang von Kempelen started to develop a speech machine. In 1791, he published a paper ""Mechanismus der menschlichen Sprache nebst der Beschreibung seiner sprechenden Maschine"" (Mechanism of human language, besides description of its speaking-machine). Like Kempele's machine it use a set of bellows to emulate the lungs. Unlike Katzensein, he only used a mechanism with a single pipe, which is more like the human vocal tract. Other than vocals, it could produce plosives, and some fricatives. Attached to these ""vocal chords"" was a formable leather tube. Von Kempelen wrote: 
""in einer Zeit von drei Wochen eine bewundernswerte Fertigkeit im Spielen erlangen, besonders wenn man sich auf die lateinische, französische oder italienische Sprache verlegt, denn die deutsche ist [aufgrund der häufigen Konsonantenbündel] um vieles schwerer."" (gain an admirable skill in playing in a time of three weeks, especially if you go for Latin, French, or Italian, because German is much more difficult [due to the frequent consonant bundles].)
In 1837, Charles Wheatsone built a speaking machine following this principle, a copy can be found in the Deutsche Museum.In 1857, Jospeh Faber built Euphonia, which also uses this principle. 
At the end of the 19th century, the focus changed: People no longer wanted to build copies of the vocal system, they wanted to simulate vocal space. Hermann von Helmholtz(1821-1895) used specially tuned forks to create vowels. The resonant frequencies are called formants. Combining different formants to generate speech was mainstream until the mid 1990s. 
In the 1930s, Bell Labs developed vocoder, a machine that used a keyboard to synthesize speech. People said it generated speech that was understandable. Homer Dudley improved the design to the Voder, and presented it at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Voder used electronic oscillators to create formant frequencies. 
In the late 1950s, computers were first used to generate speech. The first complete text-to-speech system using computers was completed in 1968.John Larry Kelly Jr. worked at Bell Labs at the time. He used an IBM 704 to make it sing the song Daisy Bell. Stanley Kubrick was so impressed that he integrated it into his movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. 


== Present ==

Up until about the millennium, the result of electronic speech synthesis was robot-like, and hard to understand, at times. Since then they are better to understand: the focus shifted from generating speech itself to recognizing the text, and putting together pre-recorded high-quality samples.

Reincarnation,"Reincarnation is the name of the idea that people are born again  in another body after they die and this cycle continues over many lifetimes. Rebirth or ""transmigration"" is the preferred term for those believers who do not believe in eternal souls. Many Hindus, Jainists, Celtic pagans, Buddhists, and people who follow some African religions believe in reincarnation or rebirth/ transmigration. Carnate means “of flesh”, and reincarnate means to “reenter the flesh"".


== Belief in reincarnation or rebirth/transmigration ==
The belief is held in many religions except Islam and Christianity, although 20 to 30 percent of Christians in western countries also believe in reincarnation.
Ethnologists have documented the belief among nearly all the traditional religions of ethnic groups in Africa, North and South America, and Australia/Oceania.  The tribes of north-west North America continue to believe in reincarnation despite negative attitudes towards it on the part of Christian missionaries and churches.


== Reincarnation in Hinduism ==

Hindus believe in reincarnation, the process where the soul repeatedly takes on a physical body through being born on Earth. Ancient scriptures of Hinduism starting around 700 BC teach that the soul, or immortal “self”, takes birth time and time again. The soul survives and continues its long journey until it is one with God. Hindus believe that the soul never dies, but inhabits one body after another during its evolutionary journey guided by karma. Karma (literally: action) is the sum of one's actions, and the force that determines one's next reincarnation.
The soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. Therefore, each reincarnating soul chooses a home and a family which can best fulfill its next step of learning and maturation. Each life on Earth is similar to a class in school. Maturation of the soul on Earth means fulfilling its worldly desires, which can only be experienced through a body.
At death the soul leaves the physical body. But the soul does not die. It lives on in a subtle body called the astral body. The astral body exists in a nonphysical dimension called the astral plane. Here the soul continues to have experiences until it is born again in another physical body as a baby.
After many lifetimes of following dharma (right way of living), the soul is fully matured in love, wisdom and knowledge of God. There is no longer a need for physical birth, for all lessons have been learned, all karmas fulfilled. When all desire has vanished, the person will not be born again anymore.


== Reincarnation research ==

Ian Stevenson found that the best research evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who, typically between the ages of 2 and 5, make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born. Some 35 per cent of the children also have birthmarks or birth defects which often correspond to injuries or illness experienced by the deceased person who the subject remembers. Medical documents have confirmed this correspondence in more than forty cases.

Hundreds of thousands of people take cruises each year.
Today's cruise ships are like floating hotels. They have a complete ""hospitality staff"" (to serve food and help passengers in other ways) as well as the usual ship's crew. The largest cruise ships have casinos, shops, many restaurants, theaters for both live entertainment and movies, several pools, day care, a gym, and a running track. The most expensive cruises often have more crew and staff than passengers. This means that the people who control the cruise can give many personal services.
Today, hundreds of cruise ships sail all over the world. Some carry over 3,000 passengers. These are some of the largest ships ever built. For some places, such as Antarctica, because it lacks other methods of regular transport, cruise ships are one of the few ways for tourists to visit.

There's also cruise type vessels that have permanent residences. Like the World Ship and MS Utopia.

Anti-monumentalism,"Anti-monumentalism (or counter-monumentalism) is a tendency in contemporary art that intentionally challenges every aspect (form, subject, meaning, etc.) of traditional public monuments. It has been defined as art designed ""not to uphold but negate sacred values"". Anti-monumentalism claims to deny the presence of any imposing, authoritative social force in public spaces.
It developed in Germany as an opposition to monumentalism whereby authorities (usually the state or dictator) establish monuments in public spaces to symbolize themselves or their ideology, and influence the historical narrative of the place. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial (1982), or Jochen Gerz's 2146 Stones (1993) can be considered examples of anti-monumentalism.


== History ==
The term counter-monumentalism first appeared through the compositions of, linguist and Jewish studies scholar, James E. Young in describing the works of German artists dealing with the memory of the Holocaust. According to Young, anti-monumentalism stems from “a deep distrust of monumental forms in light of their systematic exploitation by the Nazis, and a profound desire to distinguish their generation from that of the killers through memory.” Young considers these counter-monuments to go against the traditional principles of monuments, for example, by challenging ""prominence and durability, figurative representation and the glorification of past deeds."" Anti-monuments challenge ""the power of traditional monuments to suggest completeness, or a false sense of closure"" or ideals like beauty by purposefully creating alternate public experiences and forms. According to artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, anti-monumentalism also ""refers to an action, a performance, which clearly rejects the notion of a monument developed from an elitist point of view as an emblem of power."" Art historian Mechtild Widrich has discussed the performative aspects of contemporary monuments and also the limits of counter-monuments in many of her publications. On the current status of counter-monuments in the 21st century, Widrich writes: ""In the last decades of the twentieth century, a revolution seemed to sweep art and architecture’s relation to the past. The term 'counter-monument,' seemed to fittingly describe a more democratic ethos of engaging individuals subjectively rather than authoritatively instilling moral lessons. The postmodern breakdown of historical master narratives encouraged such a changed notion of commemoration. From a twenty-first-century point of view, however, the memorial landscape looks more complex: personal interaction, while still at the center of commemoration, has been reassessed, and is not necessarily seen as the best or only tool to engage humans with their history. Indeed, new epochal concepts, like the Anthropocene, stress that humans live their lives in a world that both impacts and is impacted by their presence: this has resulted in a more inclusive, but also a more sober view of memorials as geographical and ideological landscapes.""


== Characteristics ==
Young wrote that the counter-monument is “ethically certain of their duty to remember, but aesthetically skeptical of the assumptions underpinning traditional memorial forms.” As such, anti-monumental works possess their own characteristics that consciously differentiate them from traditional monuments:


=== Subject ===
Anti-monumental works usually address the more obscure and distressing parts of history and wrongful ideologies. Whereas traditional monuments tend to glorify these specific events, people and periods of history.


=== Form ===
The form presented by anti-monumentalism fundamentally opposes the traditional monument. This is notable in terms of their conception, utilisation, materials used, duration, size, etc. It is fitting for their form to be contradicting conventional monuments as they convey troubling issues. Often, an element of traditional monumentalism is present in order to demonstrate the stark contrast of the message coming from the anti-monument, such as the empty traditional monument pedestal by Do-Ho-Suh.


=== Inversion ===
In Counter-monuments: the anti-monumental and the dialogic the authors write: ""Possibly the most notable and most common feature of anti-monumentality is its opposition to conventional monumental form and the employment of alternative, contrasting design techniques, materials and duration. Fundamental inversions also include voids instead of solids, absence instead of presence (as with the Aschrott Fountain and Harburg’s disappearing Monument against Fascism), dark rather than light tones, and an emphasis on the horizontal rather than the vertical. Forms may be sunken rather than elevated (as in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial), shifted off-axis, or dispersed or fragmented rather than unified in a single, orderly composition at a single location..."" 


=== Site ===
Traditional monuments are portrayed in a glorified manner and are very apparent in the space they are in. Anti-monumentalism is discreet in nature, it is not obvious to the eye and is presented nonchalantly in everyday journeys along the area it is in. Some anti-monuments are entirely invisible to the eye, which in itself is part of the message that the anti-monument is attempting to convey.


=== Public experience ===
Anti-monumentalism questions, surprises and engages the visitor instead putting up distance, insisting on sobriety and respect from the spectator such as what conventional works do.


=== Meaning ===
The meaning of traditional works is usually instructive and coherent. In contrast, anti-monumentalism portrays abstract meanings and are generally unclear in their response. Their interpretation would be reliant on the visitors' common understandings and additional details provided by signs.


== Examples ==
The movement of anti-monumentalism has progressed into a movement of challenging difficult and controversial historical individuals or events. Examples include Krzysztof Wodiczko's Bunker Hill Monument Projections (1998), The Fourth Plinth Commissions – especially Marc Quinn’s Alison Lapper Pregnant (2005) and Mark Wallinger’s Ecce Homo (1999), John Latham's Five Sisters (1976), Braco Dimitrijević's Obelisk 11 March, Björn Lövin's Lenin Monument April 13th 1917 (1977), Kori Newkirk's Prime (2016), and Aria Dean's New Monument for Franska Tomten (2020). Other notable examples include:


=== 2146 Stones – Monument against Racism / The Invisible Monument by Jochen Gerz ===

Jochen Gerz's work 2146 Stones (1993), is considered to be one of the first examples of anti-monumentalism. Referred to as the 'Invisible Monument', this anti-monument exists to highlight the crimes against Jewish people committed by the Nazis and is situated in the eponymous Platz des Unsichtbaren Mahnmals (English: Place of the Invisible Memorial) in Saarbrücken, Germany. It consists of around 8000 paving stones with the names of Jewish cemeteries engraved on the underside of the stones.


=== Public Figures by Do-Ho Suh ===
Do-Ho Suh's Public Figures (1998), brings attention to the purpose of monuments and statues. The artists has created a traditional monument, that is constructed with hundreds of miniature figures, both male and female, holding up an empty pedestal. Do-Ho Suh's traditional monument, is 'turned upside down' by drawing attention to the idea that the focus should not be on top of the pedestal, but instead to the masses below.


=== Shadow on the land, an excavation and bush burial by Nicholas Galanin ===
Nicholas Galanin's Shadow on the Land (2020) is an excavation in the form of the shadow cast by the monument of Captain Cook in Sydney, Australia. The purpose of this anti-monument was to highlight the dark side of Cook's colonial enterprises and shed light onto the indigenous inhabitants who suffered upon Cook's arrival. The excavation could be interpreted as either a past or future burial of the long-standing monument which still serves to praise the heroics of colonialism.


=== Vietnam Veterans Memorial by Maya Lin ===

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., was designed by Maya Lin and dedicated in 1982. Lin, an architect and graduate of Yale University, won the competition for the design at the age of 21. It consists of large chevron shaped, polished black granite walls descending into the landscape. It was a controversial design at the time of its dedication. Senator Jim Webb expressed shock: “I never in my wildest dreams imagined such a nihilistic slab of stone.” James Watt, secretary of the interior under President Ronald Reagan, initially refused to issue a building permit for the memorial due to the public outcry about the design.
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, despite its official title, works as an anti-monument as it is essentially conceptual art in its minimalism. Catesby Leigh writes in her book Anti-Monument: The Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Its Legacy that it is a ""hyper-reductionist strand of modernist art that takes abstraction to an extreme"" It is also without ornament, nor explanation. It inverts monumentality in its sunken-ness. The non-representational form of the work allows for multiple interpretations, and that it is ""dialogical"" in nature as it contrasts to the prevalent forms of memorialization in D.C.


== South Asia ==
Pritika Chowdhry is an artist of South Asian descent who presents her work as anti-memorials depicting inhuman violence taken place specially in South Asian history at various points of time. Chowdhry presented latex casts of the Jallianwala Bagh memorial in Punjab, India; the Minar-e-Pakistan memorial in Lahore, Pakistan; and the Martyred Intellectuals memorial in Rayer Bazar, Dhaka, Bangladesh together as anti-memorial about violence and rape against women in the ethnic conflict during the Partition of India and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Similarly she created an anti-memorial depicting the Gujarat Pogrom riots in Gujarat state of India.


== Usage in Latin America ==

In Latin America, especially Mexico, the parallel term antimonumento has developed a different meaning. It is the equivalent to political guerilla sculpture, or simply, an illegal installation of a politically themed sculpture. They are used to denounce the inaction of the state and reclaim public space. Normally an antimonumento is installed during a demonstration and, as Márcio Seligmann-Silva writes, ""corresponds to a desire to actively recall the (painful) past."" Some of the issues commemorated are disappearances, massacres, migration, and the killing of women.

Gresham's law,"Gresham's law is commonly written: ""Bad money drives out good.""
If people want one thing (""good"" money) more than the other (""bad"" money), they will always offer the bad money in trade before the good money. Over time, the good money will be kept in pocket, and only the bad money will be found in the market. The law is named after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579). Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in 1565. 


== Examples ==
Silver coins were widely circulated in Canada (until 1968) and in the United States (until 1964 for dimes (ten cents) and quarters and 1970 for half dollars). However, these countries made their coins cheaper to make by switching to cheaper metals. The silver coins disappeared from circulation as people kept them for the value of their metal. The new coins had value as coins, but less value as metal.
The same process happens now with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 Canadian penny (one cent), the pre-1982 United States penny and the pre-1992 UK copper pennies and two pence.
This also occurred even with coins made of less expensive metals such as steel in India.

Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin,"Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin, or Levantine art, is a group of over 750 prehistoric sites. They were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998. 
The sites are in the eastern part of Spain. They show rock art  from the Upper Paleolithic or (more likely) Mesolithic periods of the Stone Age.  
The art is small painted figures of humans and animals. The earliest phases are of animals only. They are the most advanced and widespread examples from this period, certainly in Europe.  It is notable for the number of places included, the largest concentration of such art in Europe.  Its name refers to the Mediterranean Basin. However, while some sites are near the sea, many of them are inland in Aragon and Castile-La Mancha. ""Levantine Art"" here means ""from Eastern Spain"", not the Levant region).

Water wheel,"For water wheels used to drive boats, see paddle wheel.  For wheels used solely to lift water see noria.  For factories or industries driven by water wheels see watermill.

A water wheel is a hydropower system; a machine for extracting power from the flow of water.  Water wheels and hydropower was widely used in the Middle Ages, powering most industry in Europe, along with the windmill.  The most common use of the water wheel was to mill flour in gristmills, but other uses included foundry work and machining, and pounding linen for use in paper.
A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface.  Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft.  Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.  A channel created for the water to follow after leaving the wheel is commonly referred to as a ""tailrace.""


== History ==
Main article: Watermill


=== Greco-Roman Europe ===
The technology of the water wheel had long been known, but it was not put into widespread use until the Middle Ages when an acute shortage of labor made machines such as the water wheel cost effective. However, the water wheels in ancient Rome and ancient China found many practical uses in powering mills for pounding grain and other substances. The Romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other countries of the Roman Empire. The Romans were known to use waterwheels extensively in mining projects, with enormous Roman-era waterwheels found in places like modern-day Spain. In the 1st century BC, the Greek epigrammatist Antipater of Thessalonica was the first to make a reference to the waterwheel.


=== Ancient China ===
By at least the 1st century AD, the Chinese of the Eastern Han Dynasty began to use waterwheels to crush grain in mills and to power the piston-bellows in forging iron ore into cast iron.
In the text known as the Xin Lun written by Huan Tan about 20 AD (during the usurpation of Wang Mang), it states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar, which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device (see trip hammer). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel was in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China.
In the year 31 AD, the engineer and Prefect of Nanyang, Du Shi, applied a complex use of the waterwheel and machinery to power the bellows of the blast furnace to create cast iron. 
Waterwheels in China found practical uses such as this, as well as extraordinary use. The inventor Zhang Heng (78–139) was the first in history to apply motive power in rotating the astronomical instrument of an armillary sphere, by use of a waterwheel. The mechanical engineer Ma Jun (200–265) once used a waterwheel to power and operate a large mechanical puppet theater for Emperor Ming of Wei.


=== Medieval Europe and Modern ===
Cistercian monasteries, in particular, made extensive use of water wheels to power mills of many kinds.  An early example of a very large waterwheel is still extant  at the early 13th century Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda, a Cistercian monastery in the Aragon region of Spain.  Grist mills (for corn) were undoubtedly the most common, but there were also sawmills, fulling mills and mills to fulfill many other labor-intensive tasks. The water wheel remained competitive with the steam engine well into the Industrial Revolution.
The main difficulty of water wheels was their inseparability from water.  This meant that mills often needed to be located far from population centers and away from natural resources.  Water mills were still in  commercial use well into the twentieth century, however.
Overshot & pitchback waterwheels are suitable where there is a small stream with a height difference of more than 2 meters, often in association with a small reservoir. Breastshot and undershot wheels can be used on rivers or high volume flows with large reservoirs. 

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

The most powerful waterwheel built in the United Kingdom was the 100 hp Quarry Bank Mill Waterwheel near Manchester. A high breastshot design, it was retired in 1904 and replaced with several turbines. It has now been restored and is a museum open to the public.
Modern Hydro-electric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill to turn a wheel.

Texnikoi,"Texnikoi (TNK) is an honorary organization for students in the College of Engineering at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, United States. It was established in 1924 and recognizes both academic achievement and campus and extra-curricular involvement.


== History ==
Texnikoi Engineering Honorary Fraternity was founded on November 5, 1924 at Ohio State University as an honorary organization for students in the College of Engineering. At the time this organization was founded, many students felt that some effort should be made to recognize outstanding work in the extra-curricular field. The founders of Texnikoi include:

Its purpose is to give due recognition to those members of the College of Engineering who have distinguished themselves as campus leaders while maintaining, at the same time, a commendable academic record. Avril was the main founder and first president of the organization. Although he graduated from Ohio State in 1925, he remained in close contact with Texnikoi until he died in July 1996.
In 1989, Avril raised close to $250,000 for the Texnikoi by auctioning off his 1954 Mercedes Benz 300SL Gullwing. This donation has allowed for the thousands of dollars in scholarships for outstanding members and for the coverage of operating expenses of the society


== Symbols ==
Texnikoi's colors are black and yellow.
The three main values of Texnikoi are:

Participation in activities
Leadership in organizations
Service to the university and the community
The Texnikoi plaque is a hand-crafted representation of the Texnikoi symbol. At the beginning of every initiation period, members are instructed to make a plaque to represent the symbol of Texnikoi. Initiates are only given an unfinished die cast of the TNK symbol and criteria as to which the aspects of the plaque must fall into. Plaques are due before initiation and then given back to the newly initiated members as a symbol of membership. Alumni who have lost their plaques may request a new one be made by contacting the current President or Adviser of Texnikoi.


== Activities ==
Texnikoi meets once a month during the regular school year. Meetings serve two purposes: i) to inform members of the upcoming service, philanthropy, and social events, and ii) to allow engineers to meet other engineers and create a social network.
Each year the active membership of Texnikoi selects an alumnus of the College of Engineering to receive the Texnikoi Outstanding Alumni Award. The award was first presented in 1955. Recipients are under the age of forty, have risen rapidly in the field of engineering, have made outstanding contributions through civic and social activities, and has not received prior departmental recognition. The precedence has been established that a department should not be considered for two years after one of its alumni receives the award. Notable recipients of the award include Tamer Ibrahim in 2013.
The society also awards scholarships to its members annually.


== Membership ==
Texnikoi admits 25 inductees each year, from a variety of engineering specializations. Potential members must be an engineering student at Ohio State University with an above-average cumulative GPA and a status of at least sophomore. Members are then chosen by their level of extra-curricular activity. The number of activities participated in by a student is not necessarily indicative of his/her qualification for membership in this fraternity, but rather how he/she has assumed active leadership, administrative ability, and integrity.Membership applications are reviewed annually in early November.

N95,"A N95 is a type of respirator. A respirator is a type of mask that protects people from dust that makes them sick, like viruses. N95s do not stop gases, poison gases, or vapors.
In the United States, it is against the rule of law to sell things that are not masks with the words 'N95'. Also, N95 masks that are not checked by NIOSH should not be sold.
If you buy a N95, NIOSH should have checked your N95. NIOSH checks N95s to make sure the N95s work. The NIOSH CEL lists the N95s NIOSH has checked.
A N95 always has the word 'NIOSH' on it. But some N95s that are not real have it too.


== How to wear a N95 ==

Look for two head bands. Head bands look like strings.
Hold the N95, letters right way up and out, on your mouth and nose.
Keep the N95 still.
Pull the bottom head band over your head.
Place the bottom head band behind your head, below your ears.
Pull the top head band over your head.
Place the top head band behind your head, above your ears.


== N95s that are not real ==
Some N95s say they are N95s, but are not. These are not checked by NIOSH. NIOSH only checks N95s that have the words 'TC-84A' with four numbers at the end. The words on the N95 are always on the CEL list. 
NIOSH has never checked a N95 that...

...goes on the ears.
...has one head band.
...has the words 'KN95', or 'GB2626'
The list of rules NIOSH uses to check N95s is called '42 CFR 84', not 'GB2626'.


== Beards ==

For men, some beards may up the amount of air that goes by the N95. To keep the face seal, NIOSH has a beard guide for all N95 users. See the picture for the guide.


== Short history ==

In 1992, the CDC and the Labor Coalition to Fight TB in the Workplace were both worried about tuberculosis, a bacteria, making people sick in hospitals. People were in hospitals to get better from the HIV virus that made people's immune systems weak. This then made room for tuberculosis to infect them. People sick were both medical doctors and the public. Some  doctors not sick with HIV were also sick with tuberculosis. This was likely from evolving tuberculosis. Medicine may not work with evolving tuberculosis.
Before the N95 rules were done being made in 1995, the rules NIOSH used to check respirator masks were called '30 CFR 11'. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) also checked respirator masks. They both said only HEPA masks could be used safely with tuberculosis. This cost too much money, so NIOSH made new '42 CFR 84' rules quickly. All '42 CFR 84' rules pass tuberculosis checks. This means N95s can be used safely with tuberculosis. 


=== SARS and COVID-19 ===
Scientific papers have shown that N95s can be used safely with SARS. While SARS was around, doctors not using N95s got sick.
Other scientific papers compared N95s with surgical masks by randomized control trial. But one scientific paper said that those randomized control trials were not done well, as you should not compare N95s with surgical masks if people are getting sick outside the hospital. The hospital is where people getting sick are counted or measured, but outside the hospital, people are not using N95s. People not using N95s, outside the hospital, are not counted or measured. Badly done scientific papers made people have problems finding real information on N95s during the COVID-19 pandemic.

SigMF,"SigMF is a standard file format for storing and organizing digitized radio frequency (RF) signals and corresponding metadata, supporting time series real or complex-valued signals. A single SigMF ""Recording"" consists of two files: 1) a binary file containing only the time series digitized samples, and 2) a metadata file describing the contents and capture details of those samples. The metadata is encapsulated in a JSON file with a .sigmf-meta extension, situated alongside the binary data stored in a file with a .sigmf-data extension. SigMF ""Extensions"" enable the addition of hierarchical data to a complete dataset, a capture, or a specific region of the recording. Common applications of SigMF recordings include capturing wireless communications signals, radar, GNSS and electronic warfare.


== History ==
Before the standardization of SigMF, time series data representing radio signals were commonly stored in flat binary files with external descriptors. Occasionally, researchers used Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) containers (.hdf5), but these containers lack specificity to any data type. The VITA Radio Transport Standard a.k.a. VITA 49 (.vrt) was at times employed for RF data storage, although it is primarily designed as a transport format for RF signals rather than for data storage purposes. Other proprietary formats were created by industry either to hold specific metadata or encode signals into proprietary containers.
In 2016 at the annual GNU Radio conference, a workshop focused on how a better open source container for RF signals could be constructed and maintained. In the following year the initial release of SigMF was created to provide a portable & annotated container for radio signals. In June 2021 the SigMF specifications and open source software was moved from GNU Radio's GitHub repository to a new SigMF-specific GitHub organization and repository; the project is no longer an effort specific to GNU Radio.  The SigMF standard has since been incorporated into numerous pieces of software and academic research.

Prescription,"A prescription (℞) is a message given by a doctor to a patient saying what to do. It may say to get special medicine that is only for people with a prescription. Those drugs are often very strong, and they cannot be bought normally from a pharmacy as you could with over-the-counter drugs. Some prescription drugs, for example Oxycontin or Hydrocodone, are used illegally to become intoxicated. Using prescription drugs illegally may result in drug addiction, illness, and death.  A prescription can also be a way to tell another person how to help the patient, such as for physical therapy.
Prescriptions were written on paper.  Now most of them are sent electronically.  This is quicker. It also means there are not so many mistakes.
Know your prescription  It is important for a patient to learn about the medication that the doctor has prescribed for them. This can be done by asking the pharmacist, reading the patient information leaflet or by searching for the medication on the Internet.

Jabsco pump,"A Jabsco pump, neoprene vane pump or self-priming neoprene vane pump, is a type of pump used for liquid handling. 


== Usage ==
They are used when water or other liquids must be pumped. In this type of pump, the fluid is sucked continuously, with a capacity depending on the size of the pump and the speed of rotation of the neoprene impeller. 


== Description ==
It has a cylindrical compartment with a false deflector that turns it into an oval. Inside the cylinder rotates an impeller with radial neoprene blades, whose turning movement ensures the formation of variable volume chambers with the compartment wall. Since the impeller is in a non-central position, the formation of chambers (delimited by the impeller blades) of variable volume occurs, between which the fluid passes, which the blades suck from the inlet hole and push towards the hole. exit. 


== History ==
The first self-priming neoprene vane pumps date back to a 1953 patent issued to Jabsco. The US patent USA no. 422,191 for a ""self-priming neoprene pump.""  In 1982 another patent was given to Jabsco UK (1982-12-23, Priority to GB08205279A) extending the number of blades of the neoprene impeller to 16. 


== Marine engines ==
The unique shape of the neoprene impeller rotating inside the oval cavity makes this pump completely self-priming. It can also automatically pump the water needed to cool a boat's engine. This works even if the pump is mounted above the water level, as a vacuum is created in the unit that sucks water from any level and from environments as varied as they can be: the sea, a lake or a stream. 


== Drinking water ==
The neoprene blade unit can be used with any potable water storage tank as it applies a pressure to the water distribution circuit equal to the strong depression with which it sucks water from the tank and no pressure tank or air compressor system are needed. The system is easy to install. If instant hot water is needed, simply connect the vane pump outlet to a water heater.

Wiki,"A wiki is a type of website that lets anyone  create and change its pages.  The word is sometimes used in Internet slang to mean Wikipedia.  Wiki is short for WikiWikiWeb.  Wikiwiki is a word from the Hawaiian language, meaning ""fast"" or ""speed"". Examples of wikis include Wikipedia, Everipedia, Citizendium, Scholarpedia, Conservapedia, Wiktionary and Wikibooks. 
Every wiki can be changed, or edited, by anyone who has an account on the wiki, or by everyone in the world if the wiki allows it. Some important pages can only be changed by certain users. Wikis are central places where we all can share information, people can add new information, and then people read them. Wikis allow information from all around the world to be collected.
On a wiki, people can write pages by collaboration and teamwork. Pages are watched closely to see whether changes are good or bad. If one person writes something wrong, another can correct it. Other users can also add something new to the page. Because of this, the page gets better when people change it. Administrators can block someone from editing if they vandalize, or for other reasons. Users can also discuss things on wikis. Discussion can help people understand things better and get a chance to tell their views. In Wikipedia the talk pages are for that, but in some wikis, the article and the discussion are in the same page.
Wikis can be used for different things; not all wikis follow the same rules for using them. For example, the purpose of Wikipedia is to write articles for an encyclopedia. That is why on Wikipedia, people do not want general discussion that does not help in writing articles.
Ward Cunningham started the first wiki in March 1995. Many people liked it, and wrote there, after which they started similar websites such as Wikipedia. MediaWiki is the most used software for wikis and is the software used for Wikipedia and many other Wikis. JSPWiki is one of many others. ""Wiki"" is also sometimes an abbreviation for Wikipedia.


== Vandalism ==

Most wikis can be edited by anyone and everyone. Some wikis are even available to people without an account, so sometimes wikis will become a target for vandals to add unwelcome, disruptive or even misleading content. There are many ways to prevent this. Individual pages can be protected to allow only certain users, or only those with an account, to edit them. Administrators can also block users who make repeated Vandal edits after a minimum of a single warning.  Vandalism may not be stopped totally, but regular, careful checking can limit the amount of disruption.

Swagger (software),"Swagger is a suite of tools for API developers from SmartBear Software. It is a former specification upon which the OpenAPI Specification is based.


== History ==
The Swagger API project was created in 2011 by Tony Tam, technical co-founder of the dictionary site Wordnik. During the development of Wordnik's products, the need for automation of API documentation and client SDK generation became a major source of frustration.  Tam designed a simple JSON representation of the API, building upon the flexibility of part of the REST style of architecture. Using Swagger quickly gained popularity among API developers due to its ability to generate interactive documentation, client libraries, and server stubs automatically from API specifications. In 2015, the Swagger project was acquired by SmartBear Software, a company that specializes in software quality tools and API testing. SmartBear continues to develop and support Swagger and the OpenAPI Specification, which has become the industry standard for defining RESTful APIs.


== Features ==
Swagger provides a suite of tools for designing, building, documenting, and testing RESTful APIs. Some of its key features include:

Interactive documentation: Swagger UI allows developers to view and interact with the API in a web browser, making it easy to understand and test the API's functionality.
Code generation: Swagger Codegen can generate client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation in various programming languages based on an API's specification.
API testing: Swagger Inspector is a cloud-based tool for testing and validating APIs, with support for various authentication methods and response validations.
API design: Swagger Editor is a web-based tool for designing and editing API specifications in YAML or JSON format.
API management: SwaggerHub is a platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on API designs, with features for versioning, team collaboration, and API documentation publishing.

Bog-wood,"Bog-wood (also spelled bogwood or bog wood), also known as abonos and, especially amongst pipe smokers, as morta, is a material from trees that have been buried in peat bogs and preserved from decay by the acidic and anaerobic bog conditions, sometimes for hundreds or even thousands of years.  The wood is usually stained brown by tannins dissolved in the acidic water. Bog-wood represents the early stages in the fossilisation of wood, with further stages ultimately forming jet, lignite and coal over a period of many millions of years. Bog-wood may come from any tree species naturally growing near or in bogs, including oak (Quercus – ""bog oak""), pine (Pinus), yew (Taxus), swamp cypress (Taxodium) and kauri (Agathis). Bog-wood is often removed from fields and placed in clearance cairns. It is a rare form of timber that is claimed to be ""comparable to some of the world's most expensive tropical hardwoods"".


== Formation process ==
Bog-wood is created from the trunks of  trees that have lain in bogs, and bog-like conditions such as lakes, river bottoms and swamps, for centuries and even millennia. Deprived of oxygen, the wood undergoes the process of fossilization.
Water flow and depth play a special role in the creation of bog-wood. Currents bind the minerals and iron in the water with tannins in the wood, naturally staining the wood in the process. This centuries-long process, often termed ""maturation,"" turns the wood from golden-brown to completely black, while increasing its hardness to such a level that it can only be carved with the use of specialty cutting tools.
While the time necessary for the oak to transform into bog-wood varies, the ""maturation"" commonly lasts thousands of years. Due to the ecological reasons mentioned above, no two trunks can be found of the same color.


== Excavation sites ==

Sites of high quality bog-wood in the world are very rare. In the sites expected to yield it, bog-wood is hard to find, and access to the river bank and its bed is often difficult. Therefore, extensive preparations and the engagement of professional divers are necessary for bog-wood recovery. Bog-wood is located in conditions of total darkness, and its extraction marks its first exposure to light after centuries of entombment.
In England and Ireland, the three main types of bog-wood that can be found are yew, oak and pine. Reserves of the ancient wood can also be found in Russia and Ukraine, where the northern region has a climate favorable to the growth of oak.
In Croatia, bog-wood is typically found in the valley of the Sava River and its tributaries. The age of bog-wood found in Croatian rivers ranges from several hundred years in the southern rivers to the oldest retrieved so far, from the Krapina River, dated at 8290 years old.
In Serbia, bog-wood over 8,000 years old is found in the valleys of the Danube River, Sava River and their tributaries, primarily in the province of Vojvodina.
Saving the wood for further processing is a very delicate matter. Extracted logs must be wrapped in waterproof material and meticulously dried to prevent warping. The process of wood desiccation is complex, and despite great care, most of the raw wood is unsuitable for further processing. For this reason, the price of high quality raw bog-wood is quite high.


== Aesthetics ==
Bog-wood is characterized by natural staining and variations in color, and the direction of growth rings. Well preserved bog-wood is not affected by weather conditions or organisms which would change its strength and appearance.
Semi-dry bog-wood is sometimes of a golden or copper color, or with a tint of some other hue, and is exceptionally hard. Older wood can be completely black, yet possess the rich variations in hue characteristic of “live” wood. This dark hue is a special feature of bog-wood as a construction material, whether it is used for the making of semi-manufactured goods, veneer or planks.


== Uses ==

Because bog-wood can remain free of decay for thousands of years it is of use in dendrochronology, often providing records much older than living trees. Wooden artifacts lost or buried in bogs become preserved as bog-wood, and are important in archaeology.
Bog-wood may be used in joinery to make furniture or wood carving.  Bog-wood sometimes has aesthetically interesting shapes (similar to driftwood) and may be used as ornaments. As bog-wood dries out, it may crack or split, but this does not necessarily detract from its aesthetic qualities. Due to its natural color, it is a traditionally favored wood for the carving of dirks (bìodagan) and sgian-dubh in the Scottish Highlands.
Bog-wood is used in aquaria for ornaments, providing hiding places for fish and a growing surface for plants such as Java fern. Additionally, the leaching of organic compounds such as tannins into the water causes a brown coloration.
During the nineteenth century bog oak was used to make carved decorative items such as jewelry and in some parts of the world it is still used to craft unique artifacts. Prized in the Tudor period for its dark hue, bog oak was used to construct the throne of Peter the Great as well in the construction of Venetian palaces and the bedroom suite of Louis XIV.

One of the uses of bog-wood is for making of tobacco pipes. It is an ideal material because of a high percentage of minerals, reaching up to 12%, which makes bog-wood especially resistant to burning. Because underground currents erase all traces of tannin, resin and similar ingredients in bog-wood, pipes constructed of the ancient wood provide a neutral taste during tobacco smoking. Due to the challenges of extraction and processing, today there are a relatively small number of pipemakers who make pipes out of bog-wood.
In addition to pipes, bog-wood has traditionally been used to construct decorative objects and items for everyday use. It has also been utilized as a tonewood in the construction of high-end guitars. Today, modern drying techniques have made it possible to preserve larger planks of bog oak that are suitable for floor coverings, furniture, doors, window frames, and sculptures.

Free will in theology,"Free will in theology is an important part of the debate on free will in general. Religions vary greatly in their response to the standard argument against free will and thus might appeal to any number of responses to the paradox of free will, the claim that omniscience and free will are incompatible.


== Overview ==

The theological doctrine of divine foreknowledge is often alleged to be in conflict with free will, particularly in Calvinistic circles: if God knows exactly what will happen (right down to every choice a person makes), it would seem that the ""freedom"" of these choices is called into question.
This problem relates to Aristotle's analysis of the problem of the sea battle: tomorrow either there will or will not be a sea battle. According to the Law of Excluded Middle, there seem to be two options. If there will be a sea battle, then it seems that it was true even yesterday that there would be one. Thus it is necessary that the sea battle will occur. If there will not be one, then, by similar reasoning, it is necessary that it will not occur. That means that the future, whatever it is, is completely fixed by past truths: true propositions about the future (a deterministic conclusion is reached: things could not have been any other way).
However, some philosophers follow William of Ockham (c. 1287 – 1347) in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient. Some philosophers follow Philo in holding that free will is a feature of a human's soul, and thus that non-human animals lack free will.


== Common defenses ==
Jewish philosophy stresses that free will is a product of the intrinsic human soul, using the word neshama (from the Hebrew root n.sh.m. or .נ.ש.מ meaning ""breath""), but the ability to make a free choice is through Yechida (from Hebrew word ""yachid"", יחיד, singular), the part of the soul that is united with God, the only being that is not hindered by or dependent on cause and effect (thus, freedom of will does not belong to the realm of the physical reality, and inability of natural philosophy to account for it is expected).
In Islam, the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge but with God's jabr or divine commanding power. al-Ash'ari developed an ""acquisition"" or ""dual-agency"" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine jabr were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant Ash'ari position. In Shia Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward predestination is challenged by most theologists. Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. All actions committed by man's free will are said to be counted on the Day of Judgement because they are his/her own and not God's.
The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness. As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because ""the greatest good... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."" Alvin Plantinga's free-will defense is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and evil are consistent.


== Christianity ==


=== Academic views ===
The consensus of scholars who focus on the study of free will in the ancient world is that the Bible does not explicitly address free will.
The leading scholar on the subject of free will in antiquity, Michael Frede, observed that ""freedom and free will cannot be found in either the Septuagint or the New Testament and must have come to the Christians mainly from Stoicism.""
Frede wrote that he could not find either the language of free will nor even any assumption of it in the New Testament or the Greek Old Testament. According to Frede, the early Church fathers most certainly developed their doctrine of free will from the pagans.
Another Oxford scholar, Dr. Alister McGrath, concurs entirely with Frede, ""The term 'free will' is not biblical, but derives from Stoicism. It was introduced into Western Christianity by the second-century theologian Tertullian.""
Pauline expert, Troels Engberg-Pedersen, unequivocally insists that, ""Paul firmly believed in divine determination as an intrinsic part of his whole conception of God.""


==== The implicit argument ====
Nonetheless, many have argued an ""implicit"" case for finding free will in the bible. The most fundamental source for this case lies in the fall into sin by Adam and Eve that occurred in their ""willfully chosen"" disobedience to God.
Some contend that ""freedom"" and ""free will"" can be treated as one because the two terms are commonly used as synonyms; however, there are widespread disagreements in definitions of the two terms. Because of these disagreements, Christian philosopher Mortimer Adler found that a delineation of three kinds of freedom is necessary for clarity on the subject, as follows:
(1) Circumstantial freedom is ""freedom from coercion or restraint"" that prevents acting as one wills.

In the Bible, circumstantial freedom was given to the Israelites in The Exodus from slavery in Egypt.
(2) Natural freedom (a.k.a. volitional freedom) is freedom to determine one's own ""decisions or plans."" Natural freedom is inherent in all people, in all circumstances, and ""without regard to any state of mind or character which they may or may not acquire in the course of their lives.""

Other theologians, paralleling Adler, view all humanity as naturally possessing the ""free choice of the will."" If ""free will"" is taken to mean unconstrained and voluntary choice, the Bible assumes that all people, unregenerate and regenerate, possess it. For examples, ""free will"" is taught in Matthew 23:37 and Revelation 22:17.
(3) Acquired freedom is freedom ""to live as [one] ought to live,"" a freedom that requires a transformation whereby a person acquires a righteous, holy, healthy, etc. ""state of mind or character.""

The Bible testifies to the need for acquired freedom because no one ""is free for obedience and faith till he is freed from sin's dominion."" People possess natural freedom but their ""voluntary choices"" serve sin until they acquire freedom from ""sin's dominion."" The New Bible Dictionary denotes this acquired freedom for ""obedience and faith"" as ""free will"" in a theological sense. Therefore, in biblical thinking, an acquired freedom from being ""enslaved to sin"" is needed ""to live up to Jesus' commandments to love God and love neighbor.""
Jesus told his hearers that they needed to be made ""free indeed"" (John 8:36). ""Free indeed [ontós]"" means ""truly free"" or ""really free,"" as it is in some translations. Being made ""free indeed"" means freedom from ""bondage to sin."" This acquired freedom is ""freedom to serve the Lord."" Being ""free indeed"" (i.e., true freedom) comes by ""God's changing our nature"" to free us from being ""slaves to sin."" and endowing us with ""the freedom to choose to be righteous.""
Mark R. Talbot, a ""classical Christian theist,"" views this acquired ""compatibilist freedom"" as the freedom that ""Scripture portrays as worth having.""
Open theism denies that classical theism's compatibilist ""freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise."" qualifies as true freedom. For open theism, true libertarian freedom is incompatibilist freedom. Regardless of factors, a person has the freedom to choose the opposite alternatives. In open theist William Hasker's words, regarding any action it is always ""within the agent's power to perform the action and also in the agent's power to refrain from the action."" Although open theism generally contradicts classical theism's ""freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise,"" Hasker allows that Jesus possessed and humans in heaven will possess such freedom. Regarding Jesus, Hasker views Jesus as ""a free agent,"" but he also thinks that ""it was not really possible"" that Jesus would ""abort the mission."" Regarding heaven, Hasker foresees that as the result of our choice we will be ""unable to sin"" because all sinful impulses will be gone.


=== Roman Catholic ===
Today, theologians of the Roman Catholic Church universally embrace the idea of free will, but generally do not view free will as existing apart from or in contradiction to grace. According to the Roman Catholic Church ""To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of ""predestination"", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace."" The Council of Trent declared that ""the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v).""
During the era of the original Jesuits, a movement arose in Catholicism called Jansenism, which contradicted the Jesuits' teaching on free will. French Philosopher, Blaise Pascal was an adherent of this theology. There are no modern adherents of Jansenism.
St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas wrote extensively on free will, with Augustine focusing on the importance of free will in his responses to the Manichaeans, and also on the limitations of a concept of unlimited free will as denial of grace, in his refutations of Pelagius.
Denying the Roman Catholic teaching, John Duns Scotus asserted that ""the created will acts just for internal reasons, and therefore contingently in all circumstances"", even in Heaven, ""regardless of the perfection of the object presented by the intellect."" On the contrary, the Roman Catholic teaching affirms that when God—the proper object of the will—is known with sufficient clarity in the afterlife, then ""the perpetuity"" of the free will's act is necessary and ""in Heaven is guaranteed by the absence of reason for the will to will something else.""
The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church asserts that ""Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will"". It goes on to say that ""God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him."""" The section concludes with the role that grace plays, ""By the working of grace the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us free collaborators in his work in the Church and in the world.""
Reformed Latin Christianity's views on free will and grace are often contrasted with predestination in Reformed Protestant Christianity, especially after the Counter-Reformation, but in understanding differing conceptions of free will it is just as important to understand the differing conceptions of the nature of God, focusing on the idea that God can be all-powerful and all-knowing even while people continue to exercise free will, because God transcends time.
The papal encyclical on human freedom, Libertas Praestantissimum by Pope Leo XIII (1888), seems to leave the question unresolved as to the relation between free will and determinism: whether the correct notion is the compatibilist one or the libertarian one. The quotations supporting compatibilism include the one from St. Thomas (footnote 4) near the end of paragraph 6, regarding the cause of evil (""Whereas, when he sins, he acts in opposition to reason, is moved by another, and is the victim of foreign misapprehensions""), and a similar passus suggesting a natural, cause-and-effect function of human will (""harmony with his natural inclinations"", ""Creator of will"", ""by whom all things are moved in conformity with their nature"") near the end of paragraph 8 (when considering the problem of how grace can have effects on free will). On the other hand, metaphysical libertarianism – at least as a sort of possibility of reversing the direction of one's acting – is suggested by the reference to the well-known philosophical term metaphysical freedom at the beginning of paragraph 3 and, to an extent, a contrasting comparison of animals, which always act ""of necessity"", with human liberty, by means of which one can ""either act or not act, do this or do that"".
Critique that seems more or less to support popular incompatibilistic views can be found in some papal documents especially in the 20th century, no explicit condemnation, however, of causal determinism in its most generic form can be found there. More often these documents focus on condemnation of physicalism/materialism and the stressing of significance of belief in soul, as a non-physical indivisible substance equipped with intellect and will, which decides human proceeding in a (perhaps imprecise) way.


=== Orthodox Christianity ===


==== Oriental Orthodox ====
The concept of free will is also of vital importance in the Oriental (or non-Chalcedonian) Churches, those in communion with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. As in Judaism, free will is regarded as axiomatic. Everyone is regarded as having a free choice as to in what measure he or she will follow his or her conscience or arrogance, these two having been appointed for each individual. The more one follows one's conscience, the more it brings one good results, and the more one follows one's arrogance, the more it brings one bad results. Following only one's arrogance is sometimes likened to the dangers of falling into a pit while walking in pitch darkness, without the light of conscience to illuminate the path. Very similar doctrines have also found written expression in the Dead Sea Scrolls ""Manual of Discipline"", and in some religious texts possessed by the Beta Israel Jews of Ethiopia.


==== Eastern Orthodox ====
The Eastern (or Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church espouses a belief different from the Lutheran, Calvinist, and Arminian Protestant views. The difference is in the interpretation of original sin, alternatively known as ""ancestral sin,"" where the Orthodox do not believe in total depravity. The Orthodox reject the Pelagian view that the original sin did not damage human nature; they accept that the human nature is depraved, but despite man's fallenness the divine image he bears has not been destroyed.
The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of synergy (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. St. John Cassian, a 4th-century Church Father and pupil of St. John Chrysostom, articulated this view and all the Eastern Fathers embraced it. He taught that ""Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God"", and that ""Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God."".
Some Orthodox Christians use the parable of a drowning man to plainly illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, pulls him up, saving him, and the man, if he wants to be saved, must hold on tightly to the rope; explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself, and that man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.
Fyodor Dostoevsky, the Russian Orthodox Christian novelist, suggested many arguments for and against free will. Famous arguments are found in ""The Grand Inquisitor"" chapter in The Brothers Karamazov, and in his work Notes from Underground. He also developed an argument that suicide, if irrational, is actually a validation of free will (see Kirilov in the Demons) novel. As for the argument presented in The Brothers Karamazov's section ""The Rebellion"" that the suffering of innocents was not worth the price of free will, Dostoevsky appears to propose the idea of apocatastasis (or universal reconciliation) as one possible rational solution.

Roman Catholic teaching
Illustrating as it does that the human part in salvation (represented by holding on to the rope) must be preceded and accompanied by grace (represented by the casting and drawing of the rope), the image of the drowning man holding on to the rope cast and drawn by his rescuer corresponds closely to Roman Catholic teaching, which holds that God, who ""destined us in love to be his sons"" and ""to be conformed to the image of his Son"", includes in his eternal plan of ""predestination"" each person's free response to his grace.
The Roman Catholic Church holds to the teaching that ""by free will, (the human person) is capable of directing himself toward his true good ... man is endowed with freedom, an outstanding manifestation of the divine image'."" Man has free will either to accept or reject the grace of God, so that for salvation ""there is a kind of interplay, or synergy, between human freedom and divine grace"". ""Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent: 'When God touches man's heart through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving that inspiration, since he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he cannot by his own free will move himself toward justice in God's sight' (Council of Trent).""
God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration. For Roman Catholics, therefore, human cooperation with grace is essential. When God establishes his eternal plan of 'predestination', he includes in it each person's free response to his grace, whether it is positive or negative: ""In this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place"" (Acts 4:27–28).
The initiative comes from God, but it demands a free response from man: ""God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration"". ""Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life.""

Orthodox criticism of Roman Catholic theology
Orthodox theologian Vladimir Lossky has stated that the teaching of John Cassian, who in the East is considered a witness to Tradition, but who ""was unable to make himself correctly understood"", ""was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West"".
Where the Roman Catholic Church defends the concept of faith and free will these are questioned in the East by the conclusions of the Second Council of Orange. This council is not accepted by the Eastern churches and the Roman Catholic Church's use of describing their position and St Cassian as Semi-Pelagian is also rejected.
Although the Roman Catholic Church explicitly teaches that ""original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants"", some Eastern Orthodox nevertheless claim that Roman Catholicism professes the teaching, which they attribute to Saint Augustine, that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt of Adam's sin.


=== Differences of view between Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches ===
Various Roman Catholic theologians identify Cassian as a teacher of the semipelagian heresy which was condemned by the Council of Orange. While the Orthodox do not apply the term semipelagian to their theology, they criticize the Roman Catholics for rejecting Cassian whom they accept as fully orthodox, and for holding that human consent to God's justifying action is itself an effect of grace, a position shared by Eastern Orthodox theologian Georges Florovsky, who says that the Eastern Orthodox Church ""always understood that God initiates, accompanies, and completes everything in the process of salvation"", rejecting instead the Calvinist idea of irresistible grace.
Recently, some Roman Catholic theologians have argued that Cassian's writings should not be considered semipelagian. And scholars of other denominations too have concluded that Cassian's thought ""is not Semi-Pelagian"", and that he instead taught that ""salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace"" and held that ""God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' - even faith.""
The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of synergy (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. Once baptised the experience of his salvation and relationship with God is called theosis. Mankind has free will to accept or reject the grace of God. Rejection of the gifts of God is called blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (gifts of grace, faith, life). The first who defined this teaching was John Cassian, 4th-century Church Father, and a pupil of John Chrysostom, and all Eastern Fathers accept it. He taught that ""Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God"", and that ""Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God."".
Some Orthodox use an example of a drowning man to illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, the man may take the rope if he wants to be saved, but he may decide not to take the rope and perish by his own will. Explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself. That man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

==== Lutheranism ====

Lutherans adhere to divine monergism, the teaching that salvation is by God's act alone, and therefore reject the idea that humans in their fallen state have a free will concerning spiritual matters. Lutherans believe that although humans have free will concerning civil righteousness, they cannot work spiritual righteousness without the Holy Spirit, since righteousness in the heart cannot be wrought in the absence of the Holy Spirit. In other words, humanity is free to choose and act in every regard except for the choice of salvation.
Lutherans also teach that sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly ""good,"" are not capable of doing works that satisfy God's justice. Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and sinful motives. For Luther himself, in his Bondage of the Will, people are by nature endowed with free-will/free choice in regard to ""goods and possessions"" with which a person ""has the right of using, acting, and omitting according to his Free-will."" However, in ""God-ward"" things pertaining to ""salvation or damnation"" people are in bondage ""either to the will of God, or to the will of Satan.""
As found in Paul Althaus' study of Luther's theology, sin's infection of every human thought and deed began with Adam's fall into sin, the Original Sin. Adam's fall was a ""terrible example"" of what ""free will"" will do unless God constantly motivates it to virtuous behavior. Humanity inherits Adam's sin. Thus, in our ""natural condition,"" we have an inborn desire to sin because that is the person we are by birth. As Luther noted, ""Adam sinned willingly and freely and from him a will to sin has been born into us so that we cannot sin innocently but only voluntarily.""
The controversial term liberum arbitrium was translated ""free-will"" by Henry Cole and ""free will"" remains in general use. However, the Rupp/Watson study of Luther and Erasmus chose ""free choice"" as the translation and provided a rationale. Luther used ""free choice"" (or ""free-will"") to denote the fact that humans act ""spontaneously"" and with ""a desirous willingness."" He also allowed ""Free-will"" as that ""power"" by which humans ""can be caught by the Spirit"" of God. However, he deplored the use of the term ""Free-will"" because it is too ""grand, copious, and full."" Therefore, Luther held that the inborn faculty of ""willingness"" should be ""called by some other term.""
Although our wills are a function of and are in bondage to our inherited sinful desires, Luther insisted that we sin ""voluntarily."" Voluntarily means that we sin of our own free will. We will to do what we desire. As long as we desire sin, our wills are only free for sin. This is Luther's ""bondage of the will"" to sin. The sinner's ""will is bound, but it is and remains his will. He repeatedly and voluntarily acts according to it."" So it is, to be set free from sin and for righteousness requires a ""rebirth through faith."" A rebirth of faith gives ""true freedom from sin,"" which is, wrote Luther, ""a liberty [freedom] to do good.""
To use a biblical word important to Luther, to be set free from sin and for righteousness requires a metanoia. Luther used Jesus' image of the good and bad trees to depict the necessity of changing the person to change what a person wills and does. In Jesus' image, ""a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit"" (Matthew 7:18). Like the bad tree that can only produce bad fruit, before a rebirth through faith, people are in bondage to the sinful desires of their hearts. They can only will to do sin, albeit ""spontaneously and with a desirous willingness."" Given his view of the human condition, Luther concluded that, without a rebirth, the ""free choice"" that all humans possess is ""not free at all"" because it cannot of itself free itself from its inherent bondage to sin.
Thus, Luther distinguished between different kinds of freedom: (a) by nature, a freedom to act as we will and (b) by rebirth through faith, a freedom to act righteously.


===== God and creation =====
Orthodox Lutheran theology holds that God made the world, including humanity, perfect, holy and sinless. However, Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, trusting in their own strength, knowledge, and wisdom. Consequently, people are saddled with original sin, born sinful and unable to avoid committing sinful acts. For Lutherans, original sin is the ""chief sin, a root and fountainhead of all actual sins.""
According to Lutherans, God preserves his creation, in doing so cooperates with everything that happens, and guides the universe. While God cooperates with both good and evil deeds, with evil deeds he does so only inasmuch as they are deeds, but not with the evil in them. God concurs with an act's effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect. Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.


===== Predestination =====
Lutherans believe that the elect are predestined to salvation. Lutherans believe Christians should be assured that they are among the predestined. Lutherans believe that all who trust in Jesus alone can be certain of their salvation, for it is in Christ's work and his promises in which their certainty lies. According to Lutheranism, the central final hope of the Christian is ""the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting"" as confessed in the Apostles' Creed rather than predestination. Conversion or regeneration in the strict sense of the term is the work of divine grace and power by which man, born of the flesh, and void of all power to think, to will, or to do any good thing, and dead in sin is, through the gospel and holy baptism, taken from a state of sin and spiritual death under God's wrath into a state of spiritual life of faith and grace, rendered able to will and to do what is spiritually good and, especially, led to accept the benefits of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.
Lutherans disagree with those that make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Lutherans reject the Calvinist doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. Like both Calvinist camps, Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in that ""the natural [that is, corrupted and divinely unrenewed] powers of man cannot do anything or help towards salvation"" (Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71 Archived 2008-05-16 at the Wayback Machine), and Lutherans go further along the same lines as the Free Grace advocates to say that the recipient of saving grace need not cooperate with it. Hence, Lutherans believe that a true Christian (that is, a genuine recipient of saving grace) can lose his or her salvation, ""[b]ut the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the good work... [but that these persons] wilfully turn away..."" (Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. xi, par. 42 Archived 2008-05-16 at the Wayback Machine). Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation. Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.


==== Anabaptism ====
The Anabaptist movement was characterized by the fundamental belief in the free will of man. Many earlier movements such as Waldensians and others likewise held this viewpoint. Denominations today representing this view include Old Order Mennonites, Amish, Conservative Mennonites and Ukrainian Baptists.


==== Calvinism ====

John Calvin ascribed ""free will"" to all people in the sense that they act ""voluntarily, and not by compulsion."" He elaborated his position by allowing ""that man has choice and that it is self-determined"" and that his actions stem from ""his own voluntary choosing.""
The free will that Calvin ascribed to all people is what Mortimer Adler calls the ""natural freedom"" of the will. This freedom to will what one desires is inherent in all people.
Calvin held this kind of inherent/natural free will in disesteem because unless people acquire the freedom to live as they ought by being transformed, they will desire and voluntarily choose to sin. ""Man is said to have free will,"" wrote Calvin, ""because he acts voluntarily, and not by compulsion. This is perfectly true: but why should so small a matter have been dignified with so proud a title?"" The glitch in this inherent/natural freedom of the will is that although all people have the ""faculty of willing,"" by nature they are unavoidably (and yet voluntarily without compulsion) under ""the bondage of sin.""
The kind of free will that Calvin esteems is what Adler calls ""acquired freedom"" of the will, the freedom/ability ""to live as [one] ought."" To possess acquired free will requires a change by which a person acquires a desire to live a life marked by virtuous qualities. As Calvin describes the change required for acquired freedom, the will ""must be wholly transformed and renovated.""
Calvin depicts this transformation as ""a new heart and a new spirit (Ezek. 18:31)."" It sets one free from ""bondage to sin"" and enables ""piety towards God, and love towards men, general holiness and purity of life.""
Calvinist Protestants embrace the idea of predestination, namely, that God chose who would be saved and who would be not saved prior to the creation. They quote Ephesians 1:4 ""For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight"" and also 2:8 ""For it is by grace you are saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.",1
Fire point,"The fire point, or combustion point, of a fuel is the lowest temperature at which the liquid fuel will continue to burn for at least five seconds after ignition by an open flame of standard dimension. At the flash point, a lower temperature, a substance will ignite briefly, but vapour might not be produced at a rate to sustain the fire. Most tables of material properties will only list material flash points. In general, the fire point can be assumed to be about 10 °C higher than the flash point, although this is no substitute for testing if the fire point is safety critical. 
Testing of the fire point is done by open cup apparatus.

Commodity money,"Commodity money is money whose value comes from a commodity of which it is made. Commodity money consists of objects having value or use in themselves (intrinsic value) as well as their value in buying goods.
This is in contrast to representative money, which has no intrinsic value but represents something of value such as gold or silver, for which it can be exchanged, and fiat money, which derives its value from having been established as money by government regulation.
Examples of commodities that have been used as media of exchange include precious metals and stones, grain, animal parts (such as beaver pelts), tobacco, fuel, and others. Sometimes several types of commodity money were used together, with fixed relative values, in various commodity valuation or price system economies.


== Aspects ==
Commodity money is to be distinguished from representative money, which is a certificate or token which can be exchanged for the underlying commodity, but only by a formal process. A key feature of commodity money is that the value is directly perceived by its users, who recognize the utility or beauty of the tokens as goods in themselves. Since payment by commodity generally provides a useful good, commodity money is similar to barter, but is distinguishable from it in having a single recognized unit of exchange. Radford (1945) described the establishment of commodity money in P.O.W camps.

People left their surplus clothing, toilet requisites and food there until they were sold at a fixed price in cigarettes. Only sales in cigarettes were accepted – there was no barter [...] Of food, the shop carried small stocks for convenience; the capital was provided by a loan from the bulk store of Red Cross cigarettes and repaid by a small commission taken on the first transactions. Thus the cigarette attained its fullest currency status, and the market was almost completely unified.
Radford documented the way that this 'cigarette currency' was subject to Gresham's law, inflation, and especially deflation.
In another example, in US prisons after smoking was banned circa 2003, commodity money has switched in many places to containers of mackerel fish fillets, which have a fairly standard cost and are easy to store. These may be exchanged for many services in prisons where currency is prohibited.


=== Metals ===

In metallic currencies, a government mint will coin money by placing a mark on metal tokens, typically gold or silver, which serves as a guarantee of their weight and purity. In issuing this coinage at a face value higher than its costs, the government gains a profit known as seigniorage.
The role of a mint and of coin differs between commodity money and fiat money. In commodity money, the coin retains its value if it is melted and physically altered, while in a fiat money it does not. Usually, in a fiat money the value drops if the coin is converted to metal, but in a few cases the value of metals in fiat moneys have been allowed to rise to values larger than the face value of the coin. In India, for example, fiat Rupees disappeared from the market after 2007 when their content of stainless steel became larger than the fiat or face value of the coins. In the US, the metal in pennies (97.5% zinc since 1982, 95% copper in 1982 and before) and nickels (75% copper, 25% nickel) has a value close to, and sometimes exceeding, the fiat face value of the coin.


== History ==

Commodities often come into being in situations where other forms of money are not available or not trusted, and these are social norms.
Various commodities were used in pre-Revolutionary America including wampum (shell beads), maize (corn), iron nails, beaver pelts, and tobacco.
In Canada, where the Hudson's Bay Company and other fur trading companies controlled most of the country, fur traders quickly realized that gold and silver were of no interest to the First Nations. They wanted goods such as metal knives and axes. Rather than use a barter system, the fur traders established the made beaver (representing a single beaver pelt) as the standard currency, and created a price list for goods:

5 pounds of sugar cost 1 beaver pelt
2 scissors cost 1 beaver pelt
20 fish hooks cost 1 beaver pelt
1 pair of shoes cost 1 beaver pelt
1 gun cost 12 beaver pelts

Other animal furs were convertible into beaver pelts at a standard rate as well, so this created a viable currency in an economy where precious metals were not valued. However, for convenience, Hudson's Bay post managers exchanged made beaver coins, which were stamped pieces of copper or brass.
Long after gold coins became rare in commerce, the Fort Knox gold repository of the United States functioned as a theoretical backing for Federal Reserve. Between 1933 and 1970 (when the U.S. officially left the gold standard), one U.S. dollar was technically worth exactly 1/35 of a troy ounce (889 mg) of gold. However, actual trade in gold bullion as a precious metal within the United States was banned after 1933, with the explicit purpose of preventing the ""hoarding"" of private gold during an economic depression period in which maximal circulation of money was desired by government policy. This was a fairly typical transition from commodity to representative to fiat money, with people trading in other goods being forced to trade in gold, then to receive paper money that purported to be as good as gold, and finally a fiat currency backed by government authority and social perceptions of value.
Cigarettes and gasoline were used as a form of commodity money in some parts of Europe, including Germany, France and Belgium, in the immediate aftermath of World War II. They have continued to be used as currency in war-torn locations experiencing inadequate supply of common goods and monetary collapse, such as during the Siege of Sarajevo in 1993 or in Russian-occupied Kherson in 2022.


== Functions ==

Although grains such as barley have been used historically in relations of trade and barter (Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC), they can be inconvenient as a medium of exchange or a standard of deferred payment due to transport and storage concerns and eventual spoilage. Gold or other metals are sometimes used in a price system as a durable, easily warehoused store of value (demurrage).
The use of barter-like methods using commodity money may date back to at least 100,000 years ago. Trading in red ochre is attested in Eswatini, shell jewellery in the form of strung beads also dates back to this period, and had the basic attributes needed of commodity money. To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, before market economies existed, people relied on tradition, top-down command, or community cooperation. Relations of reciprocity, and/or redistribution, substituted for market exchange.
The city-states of Sumer developed a trade and market economy based originally on the commodity money of the Shekel, which was a certain weight measure of barley, while the Babylonians and their city-state neighbors later developed the earliest system of economics using a metric of various commodities, that was fixed in a legal code.
Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform script, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to codified amounts of commodity money being used in contract law, such as buying property and paying legal fines.


== Legal tender issues ==
Today, the face value of specie and base-metal coins is set by government fiat, and it is only this value which must be legally accepted as payment for debt, in the jurisdiction of the government which declares the coin to be legal tender. The value of the precious metal in the coin may give it another value, but this varies over time. The value of the metal is subject to bilateral agreement, just as is the case with pure metals or commodities which had not been monetized by any government. As an example, gold and silver coins from other non-U.S. countries are specifically exempted in U.S. law from being legal tender for the payment of debts in the United States, so that a seller who refuses to accept them cannot be sued by the payer who offers them to settle a debt. However, nothing prevents such arrangements from being made if both parties agree on a value for the coins.

Money to Burn (performance art),"Money to Burn was a work of performance art executed on June 22, 2010, in which Dread Scott burned $171 in US dollar bills in front of the New York Stock Exchange.
Scott filmed himself repeatedly singing ""money to bur-rn, money to burn"" while burning one bill at a time with a Zippo lighter, both from the $250 in small bills attached to his clothes, and from bills solicited from passers-by.
Describing the performance, Scott said ""I did the one thing you shouldn't do with money: burn it. Burning it is the one thing that everyone thinks is just crazy. But I was doing in extremely small form what happens on the stock exchange daily on a much grander scale.""
After 25 minutes, the New York Police Department intervened and issued Scott a summons for disorderly conduct, which he fought in court.

Purging (gas),"In fire and explosion prevention engineering, purging refers to the introduction of an inert (i.e. non-combustible) purge gas into a closed system (e.g. a container or a process vessel) to prevent the formation of an ignitable atmosphere.  Purging relies on the principle that a combustible (or flammable) gas is able to undergo combustion (explode) only if mixed with air in the right proportions.  The flammability limits of the gas define those proportions, i.e. the ignitable range.


== Purge into service ==
Assume a closed system (e.g. a container or process vessel), initially containing air, which shall be prepared for safe introduction of a flammable gas, for instance as part of a start-up procedure.  The system can be flushed with an inert gas to reduce the concentration of oxygen so that when the flammable gas is admitted, an ignitable mixture cannot form.  In NFPA 56, this is known as purge-into-service.  In combustion engineering terms, the admission of inert gas dilutes the oxygen below the limiting oxygen concentration.


== Purge out of service ==
Assume a closed system containing a flammable gas, which shall be prepared for safe ingress of air, for instance as part of a shut-down procedure.  The system can be flushed with an inert gas to reduce the concentration of the flammable gas so that when air is introduced, an ignitable mixture cannot form.  In NFPA 56 this is known as purge-out-of-service.


== Benefits of having two purging terms ==
It is useful with two terms for purging because purge-out-of-service requires much larger quantities of inert agent than purge-into-service. The terminology of German standards refers to purge-into-service as partial inerting, and purge-out-of-service as total inerting, clearly indicating the difference between the two purging practices, although the choice of the term inerting, rather than purging, can be confusing, see below.


== Comparison with other explosion prevention practices ==
Prevention of accidental fires and explosions can also be achieved by controlling sources of ignition.  Purging with an inert gas provides a higher degree of safety however, because the practice ensures that an ignitable mixture never forms.  Purging can therefore be said to rely on primary prevention, reducing the possibility of an explosion, whereas control of sources of ignition relies on secondary prevention, reducing the probability of an explosion. Primary prevention is also known as inherent safety.


== Confusion with inerting ==
The purge gas is inert, i.e. by definition non-combustible, or more precisely, non-reactive. The most common purge gases commercially available in large quantities are nitrogen and carbon dioxide.  Other inert gases, e.g. argon or helium may be used.  Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are unsuitable purge gases in some applications, as these gases may undergo chemical reaction with fine dusts of certain light metals. 
Because an inert purge gas is used, the purge procedure may (erroneously) be referred to as inerting in everyday language.  This confusion may lead to dangerous situations.  Carbon dioxide is a safe inert gas for purging.  Carbon dioxide is an unsafe inert gas for inerting, as it may ignite the vapors and result in an explosion.

Secular theology,"Secular theology is a term applied to theological positions influenced by humanism and secularism, rejecting supernatural metaphysical positions related to the nature of God. Secular theology can accommodate a belief in God, like many nature religions, but as residing in this world and not separately from it.
Aristotle's conception of God as the Soul of the World was such a secular concept.
Historians such as Charles Freeman hold that the AD 325 Council of Nicaea did much to establish dualism in Christian thought. Dualism has greatly influenced religion and science as well. By desacralizing the natural world, dualism has left it vulnerable to exploitation and damage.


== 20th-century Christianity ==
Lutheran and social constructionist sociologist Peter L. Berger states that Schubert M. Ogden's The Reality of God (1966), Paul van Buren's The Secular Meaning of the Gospel and Anglican bishop John A. T. Robinson's Honest to God ""marked the rather loud inauguration of what came to be known as secular theology on the Anglo-American scene"". Berger further states that Ogden advocates a ""secular interpretation of the Christian faith"", which, ""while rejecting secularism, will also reject supernaturalistic theism"", and ""distinguishes between secularism and secularity"".
The field of secular theology, a subfield of liberal theology advocated by Robinson somewhat combines secularism and theology. Recognized in the 1960s, it was influenced both by neo-orthodoxy, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Harvey Cox, and the existentialism of Søren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Robinson, along with Douglas John Hall and Rowan Williams, saw that Secular theology had digested modern movements like the Death of God Theology propagated by Thomas J. J. Altizer or the philosophical existentialism of Tillich and eased the introduction of such ideas into the theological mainstream and made constructive evaluations, as well as contributions, to them.
John Shelby Spong advocated a nuanced approach to scripture, as opposed to Biblical literalism, informed by scholarship and compassion which he argues can be consistent with both Christian tradition and a contemporary understanding of the universe. Secular theology holds that theism has lost credibility as a valid conception of God's nature. It rejects the concept of a  personal God and embraces the status of Jesus Christ, Christology and Christian eschatology as Christian mythology without basis in historical events.
The movement chiefly came about as a response to general dissatisfaction with the Christian establishment's tendency to lapse into ""provincialism"" when presented with the ""unusual"" theological ideas common during the 1960s. The movement also suggested the legitimacy of seeking the holy outside the church itself. Thereby it suggests that the church did not have exclusive rights to divine inspiration. In a sense, this incorporated a strong sense of continuous revelation in which truth of the religious sort was sought out in poetry, music, art, or even the pub and in the street.


== Other religions ==
Certain other religions besides Christianity have developed secular theologies and applied these to core concepts of their own traditions. Notable among such movements has been the Reconstructionist Judaism of Mordecai Kaplan, which understands God and the universe in a manner concordant with Deweyan naturalism.
In Hinduism, the Advaita school of theology is generally regarded as non-theistic as it accepts all interpretations of God or Ishvara.

Turkish High Sculptors Society,"The Turkish High Sculptors Society was founded on 22 April 1948.
Turkish sculptors could not or had not become united to be organized professionally for a long time until the Sculptors Society was founded in 1948 as Turkish Sculptors Society (Turkish: Türk Heykeltıraşlar Cemiyeti) by Ali Hadi Bara, Nusret Suman, Yavuz Görey, Kamil Sonat, Hüseyin Anka, Ratip Aşir, Kenan Yontuç, Turgut Pura, Hakkı Atamulu and Burhanettin Durupınar. In 1961, the name was changed to Turkish High Sculptors Society (Turkish: Türk Yüksek Heykeltıraşlar Cemiyeti). Through those years, until at least 1974, the organisation continued to operate without being able to be recognised as a functioning and effective professional body according to some sources. Other sources have stated that the society has undoubtedly been a necessary organisation for the international art scene of sculpture and has become a large collection of artists that has even brought forth an important exhibition (1968) with the efforts of İsmail Gökçe, who was the president of the society for some time. Muzaffer Doğan Ertoran was also the president for some time.
In 1988 it was re-established in a second period by Ali Teoman Germaner, Namık Denizhan, Tamer Başoğlu, Berika İpekbayrak, Meriç Hızal, Rahmi Aksungur, Şahabettin Köksal as the Sculptors Society (Turkish: Heykeltıraşlar Derneği).
The Turkish High Sculptors Society organises exhibitions every year, supporting sculpture and sculptors.

Fire and carbon cycling in boreal forests,"Terrestrial ecosystems found in the boreal (or taiga) regions of North America and Eurasia cover 17% of the Earth's land surface, and contain more than 30% of all carbon present in the terrestrial biome. In terms of carbon storage, the boreal region consists of three ecosystems: boreal forest, peatland, and tundra. Vast areas of the globe and are contributing greatly to atmospheric carbon release due to increased temperature and fire hazard.  High northern latitudes will experience the most significant increase in warming on the planet as a result of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases thus placing in jeopardy the carbon sink in these areas. In addition to the release of carbon through the melting of permafrost, high intensity wildfires will become more common and thus contribute to the release of stored carbon. This means that the boreal forest and its fire regime is becoming an increasingly more significant factor in determining the global carbon budget.  
Boreal forests are also important economic factors in Russia and Canada specifically, and the uncertainty of fire patterns in the future as a result of climate change is a major consideration in forest management plans. A decrease in allowed timber harvest could be a solution to long term uncertainty of fire cycles.  


== Carbon cycling in boreal forests ==

Although temperate and tropical forests in total cover twice as much land as boreal forest, boreal forest contains 20% more carbon than the other two combined. Boreal forests are susceptible to global warming because the ice/snow–albedo feedback is significantly influenced by surface temperature, so fire induced changes in surface albedo and infrared emissivity are more significant than in the tropics. 
Boreal forest fires contribute greatly to greenhouse gas presence in the atmosphere. Large boreal fires produce enough energy to produce convective smoke columns that can break into the troposphere and occasionally penetrate across the tropopause. In addition, the cold temperature in boreal regions result in low levels of water vapor. This low level of water vapor combined with low solar radiation results in very low photochemical production of the OH radical, which is a chemical that controls the atmospheric lifetime of most tropospheric gases. Therefore, the greenhouse gas emission in boreal forest fires will have prolonged lifetimes over the forest. 


=== Fire regime ===
The fire regimes of boreal forest in Canada and in Russia are distinct. In Russia, the climate is drier and the majority of fires are human caused. This means that there are more frequent fires of lower intensity than in Canada and that most carbon output as a result of fire is in Russia. Forestry practices in Russia involve the use of heavy machinery and large-scale clear-cuts, leading to the alteration of fuel complexes. This practice is reportedly causing areas to degrade into grass steppes, rather that regenerate as new forest. This may result in the shorting of fire return intervals. Industrial practices in Russia also create additional fire hazards (severe damages in the Russian Federation affect about 9 million ha). Radioactive contamination on an area of about 7 million ha creates a fire hazard because fire can redistribute radionuclides.
The majority of boreal forest fires in Canada are started by lightning. Subsequently, there are fewer fires on average in Canada but a much higher frequency of high intensity crown fire than Russia with a crown fire rate of 57% in Canada as opposed to 6% in Russia. Natural fire rotation across Canadian and Alaskan boreal forests is one to several centuries. 


=== Peatland and tundra ===

Fire indirectly plays a role in the exchange of carbon between terrestrial surface and the atmosphere by regulating soil and moisture regimes, including plant succession, photosynthesis, and soil microbial processes.  Soil in boreal regions is a significant global carbon sink; boreal forest soil holds 200 Gt of carbon while boreal peatlands hold 400 Gt of carbon.  Northernmost permafrost regions contain 10,355 ± 150 Pg of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the top 0-3 m and 21% of this carbon is in the soil organic layer (SOL) pool found in the top 30 cm of the ground layer. 
The depth of the organic soil layer is one of the controls on permafrost, leading to a generalization of two domains in boreal forest: thick soil layer and thin soil layer. Thick organic soil insulates the subsoil from warmer summer temperatures and allows for permafrost to develop. Although permafrost keeps ground moist during winter, during summer months upper organic soil horizons will become desiccated. As average temperatures increase, Permafrost is melting at a faster rate and, correspondingly, the length of the fire season is increasing. When the fire-free interval (FFI) is decreased, the loss of the SOL may result in a domain change to a thin soil layer, leading to less carbon storage in the soil, greater fire vulnerability, and decreased permafrost. In black spruce forests, decreased FFI can ruin successional trajectories by opening the door for deciduous trees and shrubs to invade, which also further increases fire vulnerability.
Data regarding carbon storage in the permafrost region as well as fire activity in boreal forests is sparse, which is a significant barrier in determining an accurate carbon budget. An expert assessment indicates that the permafrost region will become a net carbon source by 2100.
A 5 - 10 degree C rise in forest floor temperature after a fire will significantly increase the rate of decomposition for years after the fire occurs, which temporarily turns the soil into a net carbon source (not sink) locally. 
Fire enhances the biogenic emissions of NO and N20 from soil.

Doctor-patient relationship,"The relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine. Only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high-quality healthcare. This relationship is also at the base of medical ethics. Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients, to respect the patients' dignity and privacy. 
This relationship has asymmetric information though. The doctor knows more than the patient, but has to explain the patient's situation, and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done. There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses, psychologists.
There are different legal norms that regulate this relationship. Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath, the Declaration of Geneva. Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship.
Ideally, patient and doctor trust each other. If they do, this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition. Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs, of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed.
If the relationship is too good this can preclude efficiency. In certain cases, it may be good to get the opinion of a second doctor, regarding a condition.

Joint Commission of the Theological Dialogue Between the Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches,"The Joint Commission of the Theological Dialogue Between the Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Church are a series of ecumenical dialogues between the Eastern Orthodox churches and Oriental Orthodox Churches. The division between the churches can be traced to the years following the Council of Chalcedon (451) whose Christological teaching the Oriental Orthodox did not accept. Attempts to mend the schism ""were abandoned in the mid-sixth century"" and remained dormant until these meetings and dialogues in the mid- to late-20th century.
The Joint Commission believes both Churches share the same Christological beliefs in substance, the differences being semantic in nature, and that the schism can be mended.


== History ==


=== Council of Chalcedon ===

The Council of Chalcedon (convened in the city of Chalcedon, Bithynia; modern-day Kadıköy, Istanbul, Turkey), was the fourth ecumenical council of the Christian Church. It was convoked by the Roman emperor Marcian and took place from 8 October to 1 November 451. The principal purpose of the council was to re-assert the ecumenical Council of Ephesus' teachings of Christ's nature as simultaneously divine and human, opposing the teachings of Eutyches (of Christ as solely divine: Monophysitism) and Nestorius (of Christ being divine and human separately: Nestorianism).  

The council adopted the confession of Dyophysitism: that Jesus Christ is one person of one substance and one hypostasis, with two distinct but inseparable natures. As well as opposing Monophysitism, this opposed Miaphysitism (divine and human but in one nature). Those who held to Miaphysitism accused the Dyophysites of embracing Nestorianism and broke off from the rest of the church to become what is now the Oriental Orthodox Churches.  


=== Ecumenism ===
In the 20th century, the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches, ""through the efforts of the Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches"", began entering into ecumenical dialogue to explore the potential of the schism being mended. This began with four unofficial meetings, followed by four official dialogues.


== Unofficial Meetings ==
Four unofficial meetings between clergy and theologians of the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches took place.


=== Aarhus (1964) ===
The first unofficial meeting took place in Aarhus, Denmark from August 11 to August 15, 1964. Consultations were held between representatives of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches on the sidelines of a meeting of the Faith and Order Commission. At these consultations, it became increasingly clear that the differences between the Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox positions on Christology and the nature of the Incarnation were not irreconcilable in themselves, but the attendant history of anathemas and counter-anathemas would be an obstacle toward true communion between the schismed churches.

On the essence of the Christological dogma we found ourselves in full agreement. Through the different terminologies used by each side, we saw the same truth expressed. Since we agree in rejecting without reservation the teaching of Eutyches as well as of Nestorius, the acceptance or non-acceptance of the Council of Chalcedon does not entail the acceptance of either heresy. Both sides found themselves fundamentally following the Christological teaching of the one undivided Church as expressed by St. Cyril.
These consultations included the following participants


=== Bristol (1967) ===
The second unofficial meeting took place three years later in 1967, in Bristol, England. Like the Aarhus meeting, the location was one of convenience as the Secretariat of the Commission on Faith and Order was already taking place; this allowed the participation of many Orthodox delegates who would have otherwise been unable to attend. The meeting was received with general positively, with the suggestion of a third meeting in Geneva before the summer of 1969. The participants agreed on the following topics of further discussion for the future meeting: 
An evaluation of the objections raised against the Council of Chalcedon by non-Chalcedonians during the period 451 to 681 A.D.
An examination of the causes for the failure of the many reunion efforts from 433 to 681 to achieve the unity of Christological faith and therefore the unity of the Church.
An examination of the doctrine of God as well as soteriological, ecclesiological and anthropological presuppositions in the Christological dispute.
A historical analysis of the rise of terminology in the 5th century — especially in relation to the following terms:
physis, hypostasis, ousia
natura, persona, essentia, substantia
homoousion and consubstantial
the four Christological adverbs
The procedure for acceptance or non-acceptance of a council, and a comparative study of the acceptance or non-acceptance of the Councils of Nicea (325) and Chalcedon (451) in Chalcedonian as well as non-Chalcedonian Churches.
A historical study of procedures used by the Roman Catholic Church to accept into their communion both Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian groups. (Conditions for formation of uniate orthodox groups.)
Authority of the Ecumenical Councils for faith and life. The question of the formal acceptance of a council versus the acceptance of its teaching — both in doctrinal and canonical decisions.
Continuity of Sacramental teaching in the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches — their divergences if any.
Further elucidation of what is involved in the debate between one united will and energy and two inseparable wills and energies.
A historical analysis of the background of the Council of Chalcedon, evaluating the role of:
cultural tensions within the Empire, and
the Imperial power m determining or guiding the decisions of the Council.
A study of comparative ecclesiology — with particular reference to the question of seven councils versus three councils.
An examination of the problem of doctors and saints of one side being anathematized by the other


=== Geneva (1970) ===

A further three years passed until the third unofficial meeting 1970, located in Geneva, Switzerland.


=== Addis Ababa (1971) ===

The last of the unofficial meetings was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1971


== Official Dialogues ==
The unofficial meetings led to a series of four official dialogues between the two Churches.


=== Geneva (1985) ===

The first official dialogue, taking place on 15 December 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland.

Culminating a joint Communique by Professor Dr. Chrysostomos Konstantinidis (Metropolitan of Myra, Ecumenical Patriarchate) and Bishop Bishoy (Coptic Orthodox Church):""...For  the  next  meetings,  whose  aim  would  be  to  rediscover  our  common  grounds  in Christology  and  ecclesiology,  the  following  main  theme  and  subsequent  sub-themes were  agreed  upon: Towards  a Common Christology
Problems of terminology;
Conciliar formulations;
Historical factors;
Interpretation of Christological dogmas today...""


=== First Agreed Statement, Egypt (1989) ===
The second official dialogue was held on 24 June 1989, this time in Wadi El-Natrun, Egypt. This was the occasion for the signing of the First Agreed Statement, at which participants affirmed the fundamental commonalities between the Dyophysite and Miaphysite positions. 
Both sides found common ground in their rejection of the two extremes of the classical Christological debate, i.e., the strict Alexandrine, or Monophysite, position which holds that Christ has only a divine nature, as well as the strict Antiochene position which upholds a radical separation of Christ's divine and human natures. The agreed theological statement therefore explicitly rejects both the Nestorian heresy (""We neither separate nor divide the human nature in Christ from His divine nature"") and the Eutychian or Monophysite heresy (""nor do we think that [the human nature] was absorbed in [the divine nature] and thus [the former] ceased to exist""). In this middle ground, the statement asserted that

We neither separate nor divide the human nature in Christ from His divine nature, nor do we think that the former was absorbed in the latter and thus ceased to exist.
The four adverbs used to qualify the mystery of the hypostatic union belong to our common tradition – without commingling (or confusion), without change, without separation and without division. Those among us who speak of two natures in Christ do not thereby deny their inseparable, indivisible union; those among us who speak of one united divine-human nature in Christ do not thereby deny the continuing dynamic presence in Christ of the divine and the human, without change, without confusion.
The participants appear to have found this common ground by referring to the writings of Cyril of Alexandria, who is venerated by Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians alike. Since Cyril used the formula ""mia physis ton Theou Logon sesarkomene"" (the one physis or hypostasis of God’s Word Incarnate), the agreed statement suggests that while monophysitism is beyond the pale of Nicene Christianity, miaphysitism is not.


=== Second Agreed Statement, Geneva (1990) ===
Returning to Geneva, the third official dialogue was held on 28 September 1990. This was the occasion for the Second Agreed Statement. This clarified and interpreted the first statement, with particular reference to pastoral matters, anathemas, and the acceptance (or lack thereof) of the last four ecumenical councils.
The second statement also explicitly stated the validity of both the Oriental Orthodox terminology of the Incarnation (""one nature of the incarnate Logos"") and the Eastern Orthodox terminology (two natures in Christ that are distinct ""in thought alone""). Thus, no changes to the terminology used by either side were proposed, and the participants of the commission stated

we have now clearly understood that both families have always loyally maintained the same authentic Orthodox Christological faith, and the unbroken continuity of the apostolic tradition, though they have used Christological terms in different ways
While both sides agree that the underlying causes of the schism --- ostensibly Christological --- have been thus addressed, the commission did not come to a definitive agreement about the latter four ecumenical councils, which continued to be a stumbling block for the reconciliation of the two sides.

Both families accept the first three Ecumenical Councils, which form our common heritage. In relation to the four later Councils of the Orthodox Church, the Orthodox state that for them the above points [i.e., the points made in the Second Agreed Statement] are the teachings also of the four later Councils of the Orthodox Church, while the Oriental Orthodox consider this statement of the Orthodox as their interpretation. With this understanding, the Oriental Orthodox respond to it positively.
Both sides agreed in principle that they ""should"" lift all anathemas against Councils and Fathers of the other side, but no concrete steps were taken in this regard: 

""The manner in which the anathemas are to be lifted should be decided by the Churches individually... we submit this Agreed Statement and Recommendations to our venerable Churches for their consideration and action""


=== Geneva (1993) ===

The last of the four official dialogues was held on 6 November 1993, returning again to Geneva. 
Publishing Proposals for Lifting Anathemas.


== After 1993 ==
The Joint Commission of the two families of Orthodoxy has not convened since 1993, with the churches being left to decide the next steps to be taken. For many years, little has happened, but many sought concrete steps to reach full communion.
On the 10-13 March 2005, the Inter-Orthodox Theological Committee for Dialogue between the Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches was held in Chambésy, Geneva. This meeting sought to acknowledge the progress that had been made, and the opportunities and challenges for the ecumenical work going forward.
The International Orthodox Theological Association (IOTA) (registered in 2017 as a non-profit organization in Illinois, USA) aims to support pan-Orthodox unity and conciliarity, and maintain constructive relations with the leaders of all Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches. The organization has hosted international conferences since 2019, and facilitates group research projects.

Recreational diving tourism,"Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism.
Motivations to travel for scuba diving are complex and may vary considerably during the diver's development and experience. Participation can vary from once off to multiple dedicated trips per year over several decades. The popular destinations fall into several groups, including tropical reefs, shipwrecks and cave systems, each frequented by its own group of enthusiasts, with some overlap. Temperate and inland open water reef sites are generally dived by people who live relatively nearby.
The industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, safety and convenience by way of dive charter services and guide services on dives. Customer satisfaction is largely dependent on the quality of services provided, and personal communication has a strong influence on the popularity of specific service providers in a region.
Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers. Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs so that the industry can continue to develop sustainably.
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity, requiring significant capital outlay to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large capital expense, with high running costs. There are also health and safety aspects for the operator and the customer. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money. Economic sustainability is affected by environmental awareness and conservation, service delivery and customer satisfaction, and sustainable business management. Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, declarations of medical fitness to dive, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.


== History ==

The history of scuba diving tourism is linked to the history of scuba equipment development and availability, and to the development of training systems that opened up the activity to sufficient numbers to support the industry. Key equipment developments include swimfins, which give the diver underwater mobility and free the hands for other functions, the diving mask, which provides underwater vision, the open circuit regulator, a simple and reliable breathing gas source, the buoyancy compensator, which allows the diver to swim comfortably above the bottom, and float at the surface, wetsuit, a simple and easy to use protection from moderately cold water, submersible pressure gauge, allowing easy monitoring of remaining breathing gas, dive computers,  and nitrox breathing gas, both of which allowed longer dives without decompression.
The growth of the diving industry in a region tends to follow a logistic curve, with a slow start and mostly established, experienced divers with relatively high skill levels exploring a new area where there is little supporting infrastructure. As the area becomes popular, the infrastructure develops and the growth accelerates until it is limited by carrying capacity is approached. By this time the main diver demography has shifted towards the inexperienced and often uncertified diver, with low skill levels and a greater tendency to damage the environment  due to ignorance and lack of basic diving skills. Beyond this stage the situation may stabilise if managed well, or if not, the deterioration in value to the tourist may cause a reduction in popularity and a loss of trade.
Too much competition for customers amongst a large number of diving service providers in a region can lead to low profit margins and pressure on struggling companies to cut costs by following unsustainable diving practices and providing substandard equipment. A reduction in numbers may lead to more cooperation between the remaining companies, and a greater willingness to follow sustainable practices.
The shape of the curve will vary depending on the region.  Areas with more resilient ecologies may see larger numbers while remaining viable, while areas with sensitive ecologies may suffer early collapse. Climate change is likely to render many areas more sensitive to diver impact and most will probably have a reduction in carrying capacity based on limits of acceptable change. The sites that remain viable for longer may receive the overflow from sites which suffer ecological collapse, putting them under greater stress as the less competent divers flood areas that were previously less attractive to them.


== Motivation ==

The motivations of scuba divers to travel have been attributed to adventure, learning, escape, social interaction, stature, challenge and excitement, and while these are probably valid for most novice divers and some long term divers, the motivation of long term enthusiasts may be more complex. The development of a recreational diver from novice to experienced diver is usually associated with acquisition and improvement of skills, and is often accompanied by a shift in motivations to dive. Similarly, expectations of the diving experience, satisfaction with the experience available at different dive sites, and attitudes towards the underwater environment will change in divers who continue to dive over the longer term and relatively frequently. The desire to improve and learn for personal growth and the long term satisfaction and fulfilment derived from this learning is common in such divers. This could be an important factor informing the planning and management of diving tourism.


== Destinations ==

Three main classes of recreational diving tourism destinations exist. These are tropical reefs, shipwrecks, and cave systems. Each caters to a different clientele, though there is some overlap. Temperate reefs are less popular as tourist attractions, but can have their own enthusiasts, including short range tourism and incidental dive tourism associated with general tourism in the region. Any exceptional dive site may be visited by expeditionary dive tourists once the attractions are known, though these destinations are generally not serviced by mainstream tourism service providers.


=== Regions where recreational diving is a major tourist industry ===
There are a few regions where international diver tourism is a significant part of the economy They are mostly tropical areas with extensive coral reefs and predictable weather and water conditions, and often have relatively undeveloped industrial economies.

Great Barrier Reef of Australia
The Red Sea
Hurghada is one of the diving destinations on the Red Sea with rich marine biodiversity, good visibility, a variety of dive sites suitable for different skill levels, including historic shipwrecks, and is accessible at all times of the year.
The Caribbean Sea
Indonesia
Thailand
The Coral Triangle of southeast Asia:
The Philippines
Malaysia
Other regions are also popular for diving, but the relative importance of scuba tourism is lower. There are a very large number of dive sites in Europe, and also in parts of the US, reflecting the origins of the activity and a large fraction of the tourists.


=== Tropical coral reefs ===

Tropical coral reefs are popular recreational diving tourism destinations, as they are generally both pleasant and colorful to dive, relatively low in serious hazards, and the water is at a comfortable temperature, so they attract divers of all levels of competence. They are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact.
Regions include:


=== Shipwrecks ===

Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.
Wreck diving may be divided into three categories of differing hazard and skill and certification requirement:

Non-penetration diving (i.e. swimming over the wreck)
Limited penetration diving, within the ""light zone""
Full penetration diving, beyond the ""light zone""
The inherent hazards of wreck diving may be aggravated by local circumstances like depth, layout and condition of the wreck, the silting hazard, and general sea conditions such as visibility, illumination, surge and currents, and water temperature. Training for wreck diving may be marketed as an associated service.


=== Flooded cave systems ===

Cave diving is diving in water-filled caves, which is considered an extreme sport. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, but almost all cave diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave diving and cavern diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified. Cave diving is a specialist aspect of scuba tourism, as the risks are relatively high and the skill requirements are stringent. Cave diving tourism is generally serviced by specialist dive guides and instructors.
Regions include:

The cenotes of the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico.


== Dive resorts ==
A dive resort is a recreational diving service provider which also provides accommodation for clients and their families. They are usually established in places where recreational diving tourism is popular for a large part of the year, particularly if it is a significant part of the local economy.
Dive resorts usually start out small, catering for dive group of about ten divers booked by a single dive shop or agent from a remote area, so the group is often divers who are a social group at their place of origin. This allows the resort to accommodate the needs of that particular group. If the resort becomes popular, it will usually expand and may become the nucleus for development of the area as other service industries form around it.


== Services provided ==
The scuba diving tourism industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, dive charter services and guide services on dives. These organisations are called recreational diving service providers, or dive centres. The standard EN 14467 / ISO 24803 specifies performance requirements for the service provider, and covers aspects of diver training and education, guided dives, and equipment rental, but not the supply of breathing gases, as this is usually covered by national legislation. All of these services are considered distinct.


=== Experiences ===
Retail dive centres provide dive charters, which may be shore or boat dived, dive guides and information on the local environment and ecology, and transportation to and from the dive sites, and may also provide accommodation and hospitality services to tourists, or act as their agents for these services.


==== Liveaboards and day boat dives ====

A liveaboard dive boat is a mobile dive resort. The divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat and provide catering and other hotel services. Amenities may vary from basic to luxurious and the cost will be in proportion. In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber.
The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical diver lift platform. Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat.The tender may also be used to fetch divers separated from the main boat, and for shore excursions where there are no docking facilities.
day boat and basic boat dives may be provided through a land based dive resort, a dive shop, or booked directly with the boar operator. Facilities range from catered with multiple dives to basic transport to and from the site. Much depends on the distance to the site and expected sea and weather conditions.
A day boat would generally provide shelter from the weather and spray while in transit, and be used to transport divers to more than one dive-site during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them. Smaller boats are more usually used when the distance to the dive site is short, and only one dive is intended. Facilities are likely to provide sitting space and a place to sore the scuba set and basic gear. It is common for the diver to travel wearing the diving suit. Since the boat needs only a small amount of space for each diver, it can be smaller and faster than larger boats, or be optimised for surf or slipway launches where there are no convenient harbours. Protection from the weather on fast boats is likely to be the diving suit, sometimes with a windbreaker worn over it, and a hat for the sun, but this will depend on weather conditions.


=== Safety ===

Historically, scuba diving was considered a relatively high risk activity, but this perception has been modified by the developments in equipment, training and service provision. Medical support services and local availability of decompression chambers and on-board medical oxygen for first aid has increased, improving the management of diving accidents and reducing the risk of permanent injury. Recompression facilities for treating serious diving injuries are not often available, even in first world countries.
Prudent service providers will check a client's certification cards and log to ensure the diver has been assessed as competent to dive sites similar to those booked, and may require the diver to demonstrate relevant skills in a checkout dive. Where skills are not of a standard required for safe diving, or environmentally responsible diving, the diver may be requested to take part in remedial training.


=== Equipment ===

The dive tourism industry tends to provide rental equipment to travelling divers more than equipment sales and service, but those aspects are considered valuable adjuncts. Scuba equipment is relatively heavy, and some components (scuba cylinders and diving weights) are not economically transportable by air, and may be included in the cost of a dive. Regulators, wet-suits, masks and fins are more personal equipment, and may be brought by the diver or rented, so a fairly large stock and where applicable, range of sizes is necessary to be able to rent equipment to all customers at a given time. Cameras and dive computers are usually owned by the diver, though entry-level examples may be available for hire at some dive centres. Some equipment manufacturers and distributors encourage exclusive provision of their products through financial incentives, and the range of spares and tools for servicing is affected by the range of equipment stocked, so the range of equipment available may be limited.


=== Diver training ===

There is a large market for diver training while on vacation. Most parts of the world do not have desirable local recreational dive sites, and many divers choose to combine training with a vacation to an area of popular dive sites. Sites suitable for entry-level training often differ considerably from sites which feature as highly desirable for scenic dives and high biodiversity, and unskilled beginners are necessarily kept away from deeper sites with more challenging conditions for their own safety and the protection of the often fragile ecosystems. Specialist wreck diving, cave diving and low environmental impact diving courses are usually available where the local sites are associated with requirements for these certifications.
The Universal Referral Program (URP) is a system intended to facilitate completion of training for open water recreational scuba diving students who intend to do their training dives at a place different from the venue for the theory and confined water training. More specifically, it allows inter agency referral - the referral instructor is not necessarily a member of the same certification agency as the initiating instructor.
Refresher training


=== Specialisation training ===
Training in several specialisations, particularly in technical diving, has become popular as tourism adjuncts because of the venue requiring a specific skill set for access to the sites.

Cave diving
Sidemount diving
Rebreather diving
Deep wreck and wreck penetration diving
Other specialisation training is more optional, as the specific certification is not strictly required, such as boat diving, night diving or drift diving, which are specialties with certification in some agencies' training options, but considered an integral part of core skill certification by others.


== Environmental impact ==

During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Since the 1970s diving has changed from an elite activity to a more accessible recreation, marketed to a very wide demographic. To some extent better equipment has been substituted for more rigorous training, and the reduction in perceived risk has shortened minimum training requirements by several training agencies. Training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences.
Scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide, which has increased to about 23 million by 2016 at about one million per year. Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers.
Diver impact on subtropical, and particularly temperate reefs is less researched than tropical reefs. The perception is that these reefs are less vulnerable than tropical reefs and the sessile species are less vulnerable to diver impact. Diver contact with the bottom is also prevalent on temperate reefs – one of the main forms mentioned is fin contact with the bottom sediment, raising particulate material into the water column and degrading visibility.
Three aspects of responsible diving behaviour have been identified:

Safe diving behaviour, which is largely a matter of competence, use of appropriate equipment for the dive, use of equipment in good working order, staying within the bounds of personal competence and adherence to procedures known to reduce risk.
Good buoyancy control and trim, the ability to remain at a controlled distance from the benthos, and to do so without contacting it. This is a skill often neglected in entry level recreational diver training, but often offered as an extra course, (eg: PADI Peak performance buoyancy), in training systems that have been planned around minimising the duration of individual courses, and where the entry-level training concentrates on providing the minimum skills acceptable for the safety of the diver in the conditions where the training is done. This has convenience advantages to the diver, and financial advantages to the training provider, but as most recreational divers never progress in training beyond entry level, they are often left marginally competent, and may not get enough practice to improve.
Non-contact behaviour, the voluntary avoidance of contact which may damage the environment. This behaviour is only effective if good buoyancy control and trim are available, and it requires situational awareness which may not be sufficiently developed in a novice, particularly in an unfamiliar environment, and using unfamiliar equipment, often exacerbated by the use of a camera, which can distract the diver from detail awareness of their surroundings.
The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types:

The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites,
Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, causing direct physical damage
Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage, which can dislodge loose deposits and accelerate corrosion
Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.


=== Strategies for sustainable use management ===

Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs

Carrying capacity approach. where the number of divers is restricted. This also limits tourism income from the region. Sustainable diver carrying capacity is influenced by factors which vary between sites.
Limits of acceptable change. This model uses quantitative limits on change defined in specific management objectives for a site using an established baseline.
Percentile approach, where capacity is limited by comparison with damage at non-dived control sites
Restricting recreational divers to delimited locations, which usually concentrates divers and damage along diving trails. This creates paths of degraded reef through the more pristine areas, and will cause dissatisfaction as the trail degrades further.
Regulating the type of diving equipment allowed, generally accessories which are thought to increase reef contacts, such as gloves and cameras. These restrictions are understandably unpopular with photographers, and may be applied to both divers who manage to avoid contact and those who do not.
Changing the methods by which the industry provides services. Closer supervision and intervention by dive guides can reduce diver contact rates where the divers are sufficiently skilled to modify their behaviour during the dive. A pre-dive briefing on responsible behaviour, regulations and environmental values can reduce the rate of diver impacts where the divers are sufficiently competent to avoid contact. More effective interventions occur when the number of divers per guide is low.
Encouraging or enforcing competence of divers in low impact diving as a precondition for diving in sensitive areas. This has been identified as an effective way of reducing diver contact.


== Economics ==
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity. Significant capital outlay is required to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large to very large capital expense, and running costs and crew salaries can be considerable. There are also health and safety aspects to be considered, both for the operator and the customer, as high pressure filling equipment is used to provide breathing air which will be used in a hostile environment. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money, and annual registration fees are a required.


=== Sustainability ===
Three factors have been identified as important in economic sustainability:

Environmental awareness and conservation: The regions that are the most popular destinations for most recreational diver tourism are also those with the most fragile and vulnerable ecosystems. Divers have a tendency to choose their destinations based on reputation for a quality experience, which is largely related to the state of the ecosystem. Word gets around when a region's dive sites are deteriorating, and this adversely affects bookings and income. For sustainable business over the long term, the local service providers and communities need to ensure that the impact on the ecology is sustainable. To a large extent this involves ensuring that clients are competent to dive the local sites without damaging delicate organisms, which often requires a level of skill greater than the diver can sustain by diving only a few times a year.
Service delivery and customer satisfaction: Depending  on location, it may be difficult or impossible to consistently provide a satisfactory dive experience, as weather and sea conditions may not be predictable over the longer term. Consequently the type of diving tourism can vary considerably by region, with service providers in some places only able to confirm bookings a few days in advance, while in others a cancellation is the exception, and this may vary seasonally. Customer satisfaction is linked to expectations, and providers catering to a repeat market may be less likely to take the boat out on a day when conditions are forecast to be marginal by local standards.
Sustainable business management. (Return on investment, maintaining reputation, maintaining equipment, compliance with safety requirements etc)


=== Economic risks ===

International risks to the diving tourism industry include terrorism, economic recessions and global disease epidemics. Domestic risks within the borders of specific countries may include increased crime rates, and political instability.
Environmental degradation, partly due to the impact of recreational diving on the environment, where pollution and direct damage by divers have been recorded, and the effects of natural disasters and climate change such as increased water temperature causing coral bleaching are threatening the industry, as divers are less inclined to visit areas where these problems have been reported. Overexploitation by fishing and illegal extraction have led to some sites being closed and permit systems introduced, sometimes limiting the numbers of divers that may visit an area in a given time interval.
The global economic downturn has reduced spending on expensive leisure activities, reducing the income of tourism destinations, including scuba diving charters and diving schools, and political instability deters visitors to a region
Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.
A large proportion of divers visiting tropical coral reef destinations are international travellers – circumstances that may induce them not to travel, or not to visit a particular region can have a strong influence on the viability of a diving operation. A study on diving tourism in East Africa showed that the major environmental risks  for that region are overfishing and marine pollution. The economic risks are mainly price inflation and recessions, the social risks include global disease epidemics and international crime, and political instability and onerous visa regulations are the major political risks.


== Demographics ==

Recreational diving tourists appear to be male-dominated, with an average age in the mid thirties, a college education, and higher than average income, which is in keeping with the relatively high costs of equipment, training and travel.
The general population of American scuba diving participants are on average wealthier and better educated than the general population, and have a higher participation than average in individual and team sports, and extreme sports. Nearly 46% participate in running or jogging, and 36% swim for fitness. The DAN medical emergency line and fatality and injury monitoring program have reported that some divers get injured as a consequence of inadequate physical fitness.
A study to identify differences between local scuba divers and visitors in Florida showed that visitors had less certification and experience but spent more on scuba, compared to local resident divers. Cluster analysis identified four groups of scuba divers:

Fun-seeking belongers: Divers with a strong affiliation for group belonging, looking for fun and excitement, enjoyed diving in varied locations, enjoyed stimulating encounters and considered bonding with other divers important. They self-identified as belonging to the scuba community and sought to associate with other divers with similar attitudes. They tended to have more diving experience and spent more on scuba activities. Mostly males, and the majority unmarried.
Actualizers: Divers focused on challenge, self-recognition, and self-esteem values, likely to consider certification important and consider that overcoming the challenges is important to their self-image. Represented by more females than other groups, and lower income and expenditure on scuba activities.
Inner-circles: People who perceived diving as an opportunity to make new friends, and spend time with family and friends. Image as a diver relatively unimportant, and not driven to be part of the scuba diving community. Mostly married, male, well-educated, with less diving experience than average.
Moderates: Divers more likely to do a single dive in a day, and less focused on the characteristics typical of the other groups.


== Legal risk and liability ==
Participation in recreational diving implies acceptance of the inherent risks of the activity. Diver training includes training in procedures known to reduce these risks to a level considered acceptable by the certification agency, and issue of certification implies that the agency accepts that the instructor has assessed the diver to be sufficiently competent in these skills at the time of assessment and to be sufficiently informed to accept the asso",1
Wood industry in Nigeria,"The Wood Industry in Nigeria have been undergoing a process of structural adjustment over the course of the last six decades, aligned with the growth and development unfolding within the economy.


== History ==
The status of Nigeria as the foremost wood producer in Africa was underscored by an estimated annual harvest surpassing 100 million cubic meters in 1998.


== Production process ==

Wood sourced from the wood industry in Nigeria undergoes processing within a range of wood processing sectors, encompassing furniture manufacturing, sawmill industries, plywood mills industries, pulp and paper facilities, as well as particleboard mills.

Plywood Milling Industries - In 2019, Akwa Ibom State government commissioned some ply mill industries in Akwa Ibom like Lim Timber & Plywood Industry.
Pulp and Paper Facilities - The increased demand for paper products in Nigeria can be attributed to population growth.


=== Paper pulp industry ===
Paper mills in Nigeria have faced various challenges over the years, such as lack of maintenance, obsolete equipment, inadequate power supply, and scarcity of raw materials. As a result, they have either become moribund or are operating at low capacity.
Nigeria relies heavily on imported paper products.


== Common wood usage in Nigeria ==
Wood for Architectural Purpose - The utilization of these wood species is prevalent among a majority of individuals in the construction of shops, residences, shrines, animal enclosures, and yam storage structures. Currently, the impact of modernization has led to a gradual substitution of traditional architectural wood applications with contemporary building materials such as cement blocks, bricks, aluminum roofing sheets, window glass, and steel rods.
Wood for Musical Instruments - A wide array of musical instruments, encompassing flutes, drums, gongs, bongo drums, okbokolo, ichaka, and others, are crafted from various wood types within the Anaocha, Anambra, Nigeria. These materials range from hardwoods like Iroko to softer varieties such as Akpu (Ceiba pentandra), spanning both historical and contemporary contexts.
Wood for Carving Religious Figurines - Softwood types such as Akanta (Rauvolfia vomitoria), Ngwu (Alba feminea), Akpu (C. pentandra), and Ube (Dacryodes edulis) are used by most wood carvers in Anaocha for carving figurines and other sacred objects such as Ikenga, Agwu, masquerade masks, and royal stools/drums. This aspect of wood usage in the area is very important because it affirms the people's support for African cosmology and preference in carved objects made with good wood.
Wood as a Source of Energy Supply - Fuelwood constitutes the main source of fuel for cooking, as more than 76% of Nigerians use fuelwood, leaving only 26% for cooking gas, kerosene, coal, and electricity. Sources of fuelwood include deadwoods, dry branches, twigs, wet/life woods, sawdust from wood, and charcoal extracted from wood. Users of fuelwood in the study area include smiths, palm oil millers, cassava (garri) producers, and bakery industries, among others.
Wood for Household Furniture - Furniture produced from wood sources in the study area included upholstery, cane chairs, basket, broom, mat, and mortar/pestle. All these constitute household materials used for subsistence living in the study area. Oga tree provides major raw material for cane weaving, and cane crafts are produced in various sizes and shapes to serve different purposes. Its products include cane cupboard, cane bed, cane chair, cane basket, and cane mirror. Baskets, on the contrary, are produced in large quantities, ranging from large to medium and small to extra small sizes serving different purposes.
Wood for Casket Production - Across various Igbo-speaking communities and broader regions, wooden materials including bamboo stems and banana leaves were historically employed for interring individuals from varied social strata. In contemporary contexts, wood is meticulously fashioned into a distinct form known as a casket, exclusively designated for the burial of deceased individuals.
Wood for Fortification - During antiquity, wooden resources such as Ogilisi (Newbouldia laevis) and palm fronds (Elaeis guineensis) served as primary materials for constructing fences and gates surrounding numerous compounds within Igbo communities. This practice persists within the Anaocha Local Government Area, in Nigeria where palm fronds, Ogilisi, and lumber sourced from palm trees continue to be utilized for reinforcing family compounds among those without access to cement blocks. Wood also finds application in delineating boundaries for compounds, agricultural lands, villages, and towns.

Etruscan sculpture,"Etruscan sculpture was one of the most important artistic expressions of the Etruscan people, who inhabited the regions of Northern Italy and Central Italy between about the 9th century BC and the 1st century BC. Etruscan art was largely a derivation of Greek art, although developed with many characteristics of its own. Given the almost total lack of Etruscan written documents, a problem compounded by the paucity of information on their language—still largely undeciphered—it is in their art that the keys to the reconstruction of their history are to be found, although Greek and Roman chronicles are also of great help. Like its culture in general, Etruscan sculpture has many obscure aspects for scholars, being the subject of controversy and forcing them to propose their interpretations always tentatively, but the consensus is that it was part of the most important and original legacy of Italian art and even contributed significantly to the initial formation of the artistic traditions of ancient Rome. The view of Etruscan sculpture as a homogeneous whole is erroneous, there being important variations, both regional and temporal.


== Historical context ==
The origin of the Etruscans has been the subject of controversy since antiquity. Herodotus believed that they were the descendants of populations coming from Anatolia before 800 BC, who displaced the previous inhabitants, although Dionysius of Halicarnassus had them as autochthonous. Modern research has not reached a consensus either and experts ended up considering this issue unsolvable, going on to study, how society was organized, rather than where they came from. What is known with certainty is that by the middle of the 7th century BC their main cities had already been founded, beginning immediately a period of territorial expansion that ended up dominating a large region more or less in the center of the Italic peninsula, ranging from Veneto and Lombardy to Latium and Campania, what has been called Etruria. However, in the following centuries their conquests were threatened and several Italian peoples managed to have their advances remitted. Finally, their last strongholds were taken by the Romans, who absorbed their culture and caused their dissolution. At their peak, the Etruscans were the most powerful people in pre-Roman Italy and established a thriving civilisation with a large agricultural production, a powerful fleet, a flourishing trade covering much of the Mediterranean Sea and a unique culture, where art played a great role, having a major influence on the initial formation of the art of Ancient Rome.
Their presence in Italy is assumed from the 9th century BC, but inscriptions on monuments and objects, which provide greater certainty in their dating, only appear around 700 BC. Although they shared a common culture, the Etruscans did not form a coherent political unit and their social organisation was similar to the Greek polis system, they even fought each other as well. There are no surviving literary Etruscan texts, their history can be recovered directly from archaeological evidence, but much of what is known has been recounted by the Greeks and Romans. Titus Livy speaks of a society of ""Etruscan people"" made up of ""brothers-in-law"" (consanguineous), ""sodales"" (brothers in arms) and ""clients"" (people who offered their services and expected to receive protection from their patrons.)


=== Greece and Etruria ===
They maintained contact with Greece, possibly from their origins, a contact that intensified when the Greeks founded their first colonies in the south of the Italic peninsula, around 775-750 BC. They adopted an alphabet similar to the Greek alphabet and, also part of their mythology and imported Greek utensils in large quantities, especially ceramics. These objects found in Etruscan territory have been one of the sources for determining the chronology of their history. The oldest inscriptions in the Etruscan language date back to the 7th century BC and the first signs are painted on pottery, always related to the Greek alphabet but adapted to the local language. Writing has also been found on tablets inside princely grave goods, which was a sign of social distinction. In fact, the Greek influence has become so important that the nomenclature of Etruscan art history mirrors that used to describe the corresponding periods of Greek art:

Vilanovan Period or geometric: 9th-8th BC.
Orientalizing Period: 7th century BC.
Archaic Period: 6th to mid-5th century BC.
Classical Period: mid-5th to mid-4th century BC.
Hellenistic Period: 3rd-1st century BC.
Even with the massive assimilation of foreign culture it is significant that both the Greeks and later the Romans considered the Etruscans a perfectly individualised people. The study of Etruscan culture began in the Renaissance and deepened from the 19th century, but older historians often condemned their sculpture, seeing it as a mere imitation, without creativity, of Greek art. This position has been changing in recent years and today it is considered an original phenomenon. In any case, the distinction between Greek sculptures in Etruria and Etruscan sculptures proper is often still very difficult for modern critics. The influences Phoenician art, Roman art, Egyptian art and Eastern art, together with the loss of much of their most relevant sculptural production, make the problem even more complicated. However, the examination of Etruscan sculpture, in comparison with its neighbours, especially the Greeks, can lead to biased estimates of value and significance that prevent appreciating it for its intrinsic and typical values, since historically Greek sculpture, especially of the classical period, was often considered as the ideal model of Western sculpture; a view that still resonates in studies and popular vision. The completion of several archaeological excavations in recent years on sites found intact and the restoration of capital works that had been disfigured by interventions in the 19th century, have provided a great deal of additional authentic information for a greater understanding of the dark corners of this subject.


=== Private sculpture ===

One of the distinctive features of Etruscan sculpture is that it served, primarily, for private decoration and religion. In their zenith period, the Etruscans developed a wealthy and cultivated elite, lovers of art and luxury, but unlike other peoples of antiquity, they seem to have had no interest in recording through art their own history, extolling the virtues of the citizens. Neither did they create great works of worship for the gods nor did they wish to adorn their cities with great civil monuments to proclaim the glory of their civilization. Therefore, the figure of a creative artist or stylistic schools recognized for their individual genius did not emerge either. Their art is anonymous, collective, eclectic and non-competitive. However, the name of an Etruscan sculptor (Vulca) who worked in Rome and became famous there is known. Thus, sculpture was essentially utilitarian, both religious and decorative or private. Their deep belief in life after death made them develop a complex system of funerary practices, whose aim was mainly to provide comfort to the dead in their sepulchral abode and to please the gods by filling it with objects that were intended to facilitate their afterlife. From the Archaic period onwards, the design of the tombs was carried out as if they were real houses for the dead; a custom that continued until their immersion in Roman culture. Their characteristics varied according to the period, the region and the social class of the deceased and in certain phases, the tombs of the most important people became extraordinarily rich.


=== Religious sculpture ===
Religion also determined the preference for certain types of sculpture present in tombs, such as votives and statuettes of the gods, beyond the sculpted figures of the dead in funerary urns and sarcophagi. Statuary linked to funerary contexts is by far the most abundant Etruscan production. Other typologies are also important such as the embracing couple and various statuettes, amulets and reliefs showing images of a strong sexual character, used in a wide variety of ritual conjuration practices. Scenes of human sacrifice also appeared frequently, often in striking realistic detail with the episode of the sacrifice of Iphigenia being especially common. The images possibly did not reflect real sacrifices, but substituted them symbolically. Another recurring theme is the figuration of various local and Greek myths, focusing mostly on violent battle scenes. But while the Greeks created many images of gods and deified even abstract virtues, the Etruscans approached them much less concretely, with several images of which it is not even known if they were any local divinity.


=== Decorative sculpture ===
As for nudity in sculpture, the Etruscans had very different opinions from the Greeks. While the latter widely favoured it, the former avoided it, rarely showing nudity, but innovated the type of the nursing mother with exposed breast, unprecedented in Greek art, a typology that with the advent of Christianity would be a direct ancestor of a variation of the fertile type of the Virgin, the Virgo lactans. With respect to their stylistic canons, according to Cunningham and Reich,  the Etruscans were not like the Greeks, concerned with deep reflections on the associations between art and ethics or the understanding of how the body functions in an artistic representation and their attention was directed more to the immediate effects of the figures. Proof of this is the existence of countless distorted, schematic or disproportionate figures, often with a rudimentary finish, approaching the character of caricature, highlighting individual features without any idealism. For the decorative groups on the façades of temples and on some private buildings, their composition was not a logical complement to the form of the building, but a free decorative addition, regardless of the architectural coherence. These groups are the most typical and original genre of monumental Etruscan sculpture.


== Periods ==


=== Villanova ===

The period of Villanova culture, sometimes called geometric, was the prelude to the formation of the Etruscan civilization. Its name is the same as that of an important archaeological site, that of Villanova, discovered in 1853 by Giovanni Gozzadini, near Bologna, characterized by the funerary rite of burial and by the biconical cinerary vase. The period was characterised by the expansion and refinement of metallurgy and by an art that often employed simple geometric motifs arranged in complex patterns, inherited from earlier cultures—local and Greek—and which would remain in Etruscan art until historic times. The earlier local tradition—called ""proto-Vilanovanian"" culture—seems to have influenced the custom of adding small sculptural elements on funerary vessels and urns, while the Greek element is manifested in the creation of tiny animal figures in bronze, which basically imitate the designs found on the vessels. Vulci was probably the first center to have a typically Etruscan artistic tradition, manifested in forms of vessels and cauldrons with small groups of figurines of men and animals on their lids. These were the first human representations in Italian art only attributed with some certainty to mythological characters from the end of the period.

The artistic production of Villanova seems to have been abundant, but there are few sculptural remains. The objects recovered by archaeologists have been found in funerary contexts inside the tombs where urns containing various objects were deposited. They are of small dimensions and are mostly utilitarian bronze objects, such as harnesses for horses, helmets, arrowheads and spearheads, pitchers, bracelets, necklaces, as well as cauldrons and pans and other utensils of unknown utility, along with ceramic vessels of all kinds: pots, jars and plates. Many of these objects are clearly of Oriental origin, indicating active trade with distant regions. Etruscan princes imitated the Neo-Assyrian rulers and with the purchase of luxury goods asserted their power before their community. The great demand that was produced, made necessary the creation of local workshops in which the iconographies of the Eastern Greek world were developed, anthropomorphic figurines were produced, highly stylised and schematic but of great vivacity.


=== Orientalizing ===
The number of pieces of oriental typology found in the tombs of the end of the 8th century B.C. is so great that the whole period was called Orientalizing. It is then that trade with the Greeks and Phoenicians intensified, becoming their main trading partners. This increased circulation of goods from a wide variety of places was due to the need to satisfy the desires of an elite that had become organized, enriched and ennobled. The main cities of the time, Vulci, Tarquinia, Cerveteri and Veii, became the main commercial centers, and the greatest number of sculptural remains have been found, again, in subway tombs. During this period, the tombs became larger and more complex, with several chambers, corridors and a large vaulted roof at the top, formed with concentric rings of gradually advancing blocks, sometimes with a central pilaster helping to support the roof. Burials were often luxurious, including a profusion of both decorative and sacred objects, the warrior princes, invested in buying sumptuary goods in the likeness of oriental pomps and typologies.
Decorative motifs such as palm leaves, lotus and lion became frequent and good examples are the bracelets and pendants with ivory lion figures found at Tivoli, a silver plaque in relief depicting the ""Lady of the wild beasts"", of uncertain origin, and the large bronze shields used to hang on tombs, especially those of Cerveteri, decorated with reliefs in a style reminiscent of the geometric patterns of the culture of Villanova, but including other oriental elements. In ceramics, the novelty was the imitation of forms hitherto reserved for bronze, giving them a new boldness in the modeling of full-bodied figures and in sculptural accessories such as vases. Of particular interest are the small aryballos in the shape of animals used to store perfumes, together with other vessels with complex decorations—the buccheros—which can also be catalogued as sculptures, and the canopic jars with lids covered with anthropomorphic figures that could have large dimensions and be enthroned. Noteworthy in this phase is the development of the art of jewelry, richly ornamented, of which there are examples comparable to miniature sculptures.

Greek myths already appeared frequently in Orientalist representations but it is possible that they were interpreted according to local religious traditions. It was during this period that the first Etruscan cult statues emerged, a religious typology different from the votive statuettes already seen in the previous phase. Some are easily identifiable from their Greek models, but others are local adaptations, requiring scholarly interpretation to identify. As an example of this are statues of a god throwing a thunderbolt, which could be Zeus, but young and beardless, further complicated by knowledge of at least nine Etruscan gods with the lightning attribute, as related by Pliny the Elder. By the end of the period, his artistic production had already succeeded in formulating an aesthetic that consciously surpassed the mere imitation of foreign models and his skill with precious metals and bronze, became known beyond his borders.
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Archaic ===

The importation of the archaic style from Greece was natural, taking into account the continuity of the strong commercial and cultural ties that united both peoples and favoured by the fact that around 548-547 BC the Persians conquered Ionia, causing the flight of many Greeks to Italy. Many of them were artists who brought a new aesthetic in the construction of the human figure with stylised or large, more naturalistic lines. The Greek archaic types of production were developed following essentially idealistic rules and set definite models that illustrated plastically the ethical and moral concepts, not finding an exact imitation among the Etruscans, since they realized the shape of the human body with a much more descriptive profile and, in fact, making images almost like portraits, when among the Greeks all the personal idiosyncrasy had been abolished from the images. Another difference is that the male figure, although it was very similar to that of the Greek kouros used to dress and the patterns of his clothes were related to the clothes of the female kore. In addition, they had a special taste for ornamentation, introduced many new decorative details and used a greater number of characters in group scenes than their Greek models. There were also differences in the material used, which, in general, was terracotta, preferring coroplast which is where they made their most perfect works. They also employed stone although never with the originality and freshness they achieved with clay and ignored marble. One of the best known examples of free-standing or isolated statue of this phase is the cult sculpture of Apollo of Veii, currently in the National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia.
During this period important changes were made in sculpture also due to changes in the field of architecture and religion. The fusion of Etruscan and Greek mythologies brought about a rapprochement in the forms of worship. The form of the Etruscan temple, which previously differed little from a common house, was modified and enlarged, becoming similar to the Greek temple. Again, the assimilation was not literal, using alternative materials for its construction, showing different divisions in the spaces of the building, in its distribution and design of columns and with the use of many decorative details in terracotta polychrome, such as friezes, acroterion, antefixs and plaques with narrative scenes or with various ornamental motifs. The decoration of the main temples—smaller than the Greek ones but more decorated—was crowned with a large sculptural group in high relief on the pediment, also in terracotta, a typology that was consolidated in the mid-6th century BC as one of the most typical and original genres of Etruscan monumental sculpture. Great examples of this new trend are the group of Temple A at Pyrgi and another at Veii. Similar changes occurred in the construction of the tombs, making them more complex and larger, with various rooms decorated according to their functions as if they were houses and decorated with sculptural elements, such as pedestales, columns and capitales, and reliefs of various types.

From this period onwards, the representation of the ""banquet"" scene is frequent, in which, unlike the Greek tradition, the women are represented lying next to their husbands. This is how they are shown in the funerary trousseaus and in some urns of Chiusi both in the painting of their walls and in the reliefs of the urns. Thus began the development of a new type of burial urn, with the dimensions of a sarcophagus for bodies that were not cremated, but buried. It consisted of a box decorated with reliefs on the sides and covered with a lid on which the dead were represented in a reclining position, as if they were at a banquet. Sometimes they represented couples, such as the famous Sarcophagus of the spouses of the National Etruscan Museum. The figures of the deceased, however, were not portraits, but generic types. It is possible that this genre was inspired by the Carthaginian burial tradition, merged with the Egyptian model with a mummy-shaped lid and the oriental one in the form of a box. The Etruscan sarcophagus model would be used much later in Rome, spreading over a large area of the Mediterranean.
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Classic ===
The archaic style remained predominant in ancient Etruria, while in Greece, the classical canon prevailed in the 5th to 4th centuries BC. In fact, it was practically ignored among the Etruscans. Massimo Pallottino justifies this difference by saying that classical Greek culture was at that time, for various reasons, more centered in Athens and the Peloponnese and had somehow blocked the influence of its radiation to neighboring regions. For her part, Nancy Grummond describes the phase as ""neutral"" which gave rise to only a few important works, the Mars of Todi, which is close to the canon of Polykleitos, the famous Chimera of Arezzo which has a classical influence but still retains archaic traces, the Bust of Brutus (sometimes considered a Roman work) and architectural decorations in Orvieto and Falerii. Although rare, these examples show great mastery in the construction of the form and technique of casting and are considered masterpieces. After the fall of Veii in 396 BC under the Romans, the most active production centers came to be in Chiusi, Falerii and Bolsena, seat of one of the most important Etruscan sanctuaries.
Classical Greek sculpture continued to show great idealistic concern as in the archaic phase, but now with a remarkable ability to imitate the anatomy of real bodies showing a combination between the ideal and the natural in human figures, giving them a timeless, archetypal and exalted character, even when it came to gods. The Etruscans also reaffirmed their originality, preferring a level closer to the natural and ornamental. Their deviation from the foreign canon cannot be explained by an alleged misunderstanding of the model, since the Etruscan elite was far from being ignorant and the artists had demonstrated high technical ability, but because they had different goals in art. Understanding these differences is particularly relevant to the study of the classical Etruscan period because of the large number of mythological figures that have survived.

In the case of the sarcophagus, there is a slightly greater concern to describe more closely the physiognomy of the dead, although they can hardly be considered true portraits. The figures are presented with more variety of forms, appearing even as sleeping persons. Parallel proliferate votive statuettes of gods and votive offerings in the form of heads, which have been preserved in large numbers, but have not yet been sufficiently studied.
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Hellenistic ===
The Hellenistic phase is one of the most difficult to describe. At that time the Etruscan empire was in decline, threatened by its neighbors, especially the Romans, who were conquering one by one its cities. In the clash of the two cultures, a process of fusion began. Their social structures changed, emphasizing military government and the formation of a new aristocracy with the assimilation of the enriched plebeians. Religion and funerary customs are increasingly simple, as tombs decorated with the luxury of previous phases were not made, nor with so many objects or accessories, suggesting that the interests of society were turning more to the present life than to the afterlife, all the more so because pessimistic visions regarding the future of their people were beginning to predominate. Instead, contact was resumed with Greece, which was already working under Hellenistic eclecticism.  
Sarcophagi and urns still continued to be highly decorated pieces, but the sculptures of the dead became more schematic and generic. Although the formal repertoire continues to be varied, around the 2nd century BC the models were already established and the demand was such that it led to their mass production, from the same mold—in terracotta—or from the same model—in stone—with a strong decrease in individualized pieces. The same happened with the pieces of heads and votive statuettes, their quality also tended to decline, possibly caused by the intensive production of second or third generation molds and the renunciation of manual work after modeling. The urns were produced mainly in Chiusi, Volterra and Perugia, while the sarcophagi came from Viterbo and Tarquinia. The most important tombs in this period are found in the Tarquinia region, Tuscany, Perugia and Sorano.

The architectural groups tend to be more populated with figures, arranged in sections that alternated great movement and violence with others of a more peaceful atmosphere and using eclectic resources from various sources, including the archaic. Important examples of this phase are the groups of the pediment of Talamone of Luni or The Orator, a statue in bronze exempt. By the 1st century BC the quality of the works in general became very poor and all original Etruscan production had already succumbed to Roman influence, coming to an end. The Etruscans obtained Roman citizenship in the early 1st century and their territory was named Regio VII Etruria, one of the eleven comprised in the Augustan reform.
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Materials and techniques ==


=== Terracotta ===
The vast majority of sculptural remains, both large—architectural statuary and sarcophagi—and smaller pieces, were made in terracotta, whose ease of handling perfectly served the purposes of sculptors and patrons and the great demand for funerary and decorative works. In addition, this allowed the creation of serial pieces through molds, a technique learned from the Greeks. A clay prototype was modeled by hand, from which several models were made, and with these the prototype could be replicated numerous times until the mold wore out and was replaced again. The piece was removed from the mold, while still wet so that details could still be added or manufacturing imperfections rectified, giving each piece a unique character. In turn, the molded parts could also serve as a new prototype for a second generation of molds and copies. On the one hand this made possible the mass production of similar pieces at low cost to meet the growing demand but as the molds wore out their quality declined, which proved fatal to Etruscan art, especially in its final phase, when the finish had been greatly reduced, with no additions or corrections after molding. However, the quality of the final finish of the works was very varied existing cases of important statuary with a surprisingly rustic finish, even in stages before mass production as the great building of Murlo, whose cornice was decorated with at least thirteen life-size acroterion, as well as with terracotta slabs with representations of various scenes, but with a very rudimentary technique. Other examples, however, are of great refinement, among which is the pediment of the temple of Portonaccio in Veii, with a mythological scene, and another set of exception is the Pediment of Talamone. More general, however, was the use of simple plaques and friezes with various scenes and minor details such as antefixs, acroteria and medallions with human, animal, plant and abstract motifs.


=== Other materials ===
Stone was never widely used in Etruscan sculpture. There are few examples of sculptures in soft limestone, alabaster or toba; marble is even rarer. Its dimensions are modest and its technique rather primitive. The details were often roughly worked, but the imperfections were hidden by the practice of painting on the surface. In a workshop at Chiusi mourners and sphinxes were sculpted in local stone, while at Vulci sculptures of fantastic beings derived from Greek mythology were made. Only in the Hellenistic period are more examples of stone sculpture found, especially for sarcophagi, but the technique does not appear to have evolved significantly.
Ivory, wood and bronze were also exceptional materials for large statues, although it may be that many important pieces may have been lost. For elaborating small pieces, bronze was a privileged material with which they reached a high degree of technical knowledge and formal complexity. They mastered several techniques, such as lost wax, engraving or lamination. They were able to add to bronze other metals such as gold, copper or silver inlays and their production had a large market among several of their neighboring peoples, especially the Romans, this being a technique praised by Horace. Among the pieces made in amber from the 5th century BC is the fibula from the Morgan Amber kept at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.


== The sculptural heritage ==
The main sculptural legacy by the Etruscans developed in Rome, where Roman sculptures dated to the 6th century BC are clearly Etruscan in style; an influence that continued into the Hellenistic period and possibly beyond, there are even signs of it as far back as the time of Augustus.


=== 15th - 16th centuries ===
The Etruscan tradition fell into oblivion until the 15th century when it began to be rescued from the work of the monk Annio da Viterbo, cabalist and orientalist, who published a book where he speculated on a possible common origin of the Hebrew and Etruscan languages, after having carried out several excavations in tombs, discovered sarcophagi and tried to decipher their language. This attention grew until in 1553 the famous Chimera was discovered in Arezzo, then moved to Florence where it caused a great sensation among artists and scholars. It was exhibited in the Palazzo Vecchio as a marvel of antiquity. Along with other statues found with it, it passed into the private collection of Cosimo I de Medici. At a time when Rome had supplanted Florence in cultural and political prestige, the discovery was invested with a nationalistic character, becoming a symbol of lineage of prestige and specific Tuscan identity.


=== 17th - 18th centuries ===
In the 17th century the Scottish scholar Sir Thomas Dempster made a significant contribution to knowledge of the Etruscans with the seven-volume work entitled De Etruria Regali, a compilation of ancient sources accompanied by ninety-three engravings showing their monuments. His work, however, remained unpublished until 1723, when Filippo Buonarroti published it along with commentaries on his own work, this work is considered a milestone in modern Etruscan history. Three years later the Accademia Etrusca was created in Cortona, which in a short time was adding various specialized studies. In 1743, Antonio Gori brought out his Museum Etruscum, with hundreds of illustrations, and in 1761, Giambattista Piranesi published a volume on Roman architecture and engineering, where he advanced several theories about Etruscan involvement in Roman art that were later confirmed.
These pioneering works naturally contained many errors, inaccuracies and false attributions, but they contributed to a first more scientific delimitation of the field of study and also to the gestation of neoclassicism, whose intense interest triggered a collecting fever among European political and intellectual elites. With Winckelmann, one of the most influential neoclassical theorists, studies reached a higher level, writing extensively on Etruscan art, including sculpture, distinguishing clearly between its style and Greek, he also recognized its internal variations, praised the skill of its artists and considered it ""a noble tradition"". In the 19th century, Hegel, although more concerned with the idealistic aspects of ancient art, did not fail to appreciate Etruscan art, recognizing that it demonstrated an interesting balance between idealism and naturalism, representing very well the practical spirit of the Romans. The Etruscan sculpture pieces were a revelation to Romantic Ruskin, helping him to understand Western art history. Friedrich Nietzsche, however, despised them. Frobenius drew analogies steeped in fantastic romanticism between the Etruscan art of his sculpture and the pre-Columbian peoples, in vogue at the time, linked to theories about Atlantis.


=== 19th century ===

Even in the 19th century Etruscan sculpture gained an important forum for discussion when the Istituto di Correspondenza Archaeologica was created in 1829 to promote international cooperation in the study of Italian archaeology, publishing many articles and carrying out excavations in several necropolises. However, the increasing availability of significant finds caused the destruction of numerous archaeological sites by wreck hunters, disasters denounced by the British consul in Italy, George De",1
Sales,"Sales are the activities involved in selling products or services in return for money or other compensation. It is an act of completion of a commercial activity. A salesman is someone who sells products or services, thus generating sales.  
Salespeople reach out to contacts that might be interested in purchasing the product or service that their company is selling — prospects that demonstrate interest through actions like visiting the company website or interacting with the company on social media. The goal is to reach out to leads who have shown interest in or fit the description of the company’s target customer, in hopes of providing them with a solution that results in a purchase of your product or service.  


== Marketing ==
Sales are closely connected with marketing because they have the same goal. Sales serve as a result and confirmation of the correctness of the company's marketing work. 
Sales are more practical than theoretical. Sales theory certainly exists as the recommended stages of the sales process, and continues to develop. The concept of sales is included as a basic in many other modern terms and business systems. 
Many big companies have some problems with their sales and marketing departments.


== Handling objection ==
A sales objection is an explicit expression by a buyer that a barrier exists between the current situation and what needs to be satisfied before buying from that particular seller. While selling there will be objections from the buyer which the seller needs to handle wisely without losing the leads.
When a buyer indicates objections, the salesperson does not get discouraged but takes it as a chance to explain the value of the product or service. And if the seller can't persuade them, that's a good sign they're a poor fit. 


== Methods ==
There are many classifications of sales:

Wholesale and retail sales
Sales in the B2B and B2C segment
Active sales
Direct sale
Multilevel marketing
""Short"" and ""long"" sales
Mobile sale
Sale of goods and services
Industry sales: food, building materials, etc.
Live Auctions
Spot bid sales
Retail sales
Agency Sales
Consultative Sales

Candle,"A candle is a stick made of wax with a string (a thin piece of rope) straight in the middle. If someone puts the string on fire, the flame burns slowly but for a long time.
Fire can burn string very fast. But in a candle, the string does not burn fast, because the fire melts the wax instead. The wax sometimes drips down the side of the candle. When the melted wax is far from the flame, it gets hard again, and can be used again in a new candle. 
The flame is very hot, since it is a very small, real fire. The light blue part of the flame can be as hot as 1,400 °C (2,550 °F). It can still burn people and things. If the fire spreads, it can grow into a very big fire and even burn down a house or building. 
If the flame is kept on the candle long enough, the candle will slowly get shorter and shorter until it is gone. The fire on a candle can be put out by blowing air on it. There is also a special tool called a ""candle snuffer"" that covers the fire with a small metal cup and puts it out. Today, candle snuffers are usually only used in churches or in places where candles are up very high. Stopping the fire stops the candle from burning until it is all gone.
Before light bulbs, candles were used so people could see at night. Some people still use candles today when electricity is down, or because they like the little amount of light that candles make. Some people also like candles because they look nice, or because they smell nice. A special kind of plant called ""citronella"" can be infused into the candle to help keep bugs away.

Terminology of alternative medicine,"Alternative medicine describes any practice which aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine, but which lacks biological plausibility and is untested or untestable. Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon.


== Terms for alternative medicine ==
The terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, and new age medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts.

The meaning of the term ""alternative"" in the expression ""alternative medicine"", is not that it is an effective alternative to medical science, although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness. Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not, e.g., the use of the expressions ""Western medicine"" and ""Eastern medicine"" to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asiatic east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between evidence-based medicine and treatments that do not work.


=== Complementary or integrative medicine ===
Complementary medicine (CM) or integrative medicine (IM) is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment, in a belief that it improves the effect of treatments. For example, acupuncture (piercing the body with needles to influence the flow of a supernatural energy) might be believed to increase the effectiveness or ""complement"" science-based medicine when used at the same time. Instead, significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may make treatments less effective, notably in cancer therapy. Integrative medicine has been described as an attempt to bring pseudoscience into academic science-based medicine. Due to its many names, the field has been criticized by writer Rose Shapiro for what she describes as intense rebranding of what are essentially the same practices.
CAM is an abbreviation of the phrase complementary and alternative medicine. The 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine states that the terms complementary and alternative medicine ""refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own traditional or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system. They are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries.""


=== Other terms ===

Traditional medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within the folk beliefs of various societies, including indigenous peoples, before the era of modern medicine. The 2019 WHO study defines traditional medicine as ""the sum total of the knowledge, skill and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.""
Holistic medicine is another rebranding of alternative medicine. In this case, the words balance and holism are often used alongside complementary or integrative, claiming to take into account a ""whole"" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine.


== Definitions of alternative medicine ==
Alternative medicine is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of medicine, but whose effectiveness has not been established using scientific methods, or whose theory and practice is not part of biomedicine, or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by scientific evidence or scientific principles used in biomedicine. ""Biomedicine"" or ""medicine"" is that part of medical science that applies principles of biology, physiology, molecular biology, biophysics, and other natural sciences to clinical practice, using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice. Unlike medicine, an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methods, but may instead be based on hearsay, religion, tradition, superstition, belief in supernatural energies, pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or other unscientific sources.


=== Challenges in defining alternative medicine ===
Terminology has shifted over time, reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners. For example, the United States National Institutes of Health department studying alternative medicine, currently named the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), was established as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) and was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) before obtaining its current name. Therapies are often framed as ""natural"" or ""holistic"", in apparent opposition to conventional medicine which is ""artificial"" and ""narrow in scope"", statements which are intentionally misleading.
Prominent members of the science and biomedical science community say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine, because the expressions ""conventional medicine"", ""alternative medicine"", ""complementary medicine"", ""integrative medicine"",  and ""holistic medicine"" do not refer to any medicine at all. Others say that alternative medicine cannot be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes, and because the boundaries between alternative and conventional medicine overlap, are porous, and change. The systems and practices it refers to are diffuse, and its boundaries poorly defined. Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin, theoretical basis, diagnostic technique, therapeutic practice and in their relationship to the medical mainstream. Some alternative therapies, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, have antique origins in East or South Asia and are entirely alternative medical systems;: 13  IOM Report 2005, p. 18.</ref> others, such as homeopathy and chiropractic, have origins in Europe or the United States and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some, such as osteopathy and chiropractic, employ manipulative physical methods of treatment; others, such as meditation and prayer, are based on mind-body interventions. Under a definition of alternative medicine as ""non-mainstream"", treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another.
Critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that complementary is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a placebo. It has been said that ""there is really no such thing as alternative medicine, just medicine that works and medicine that doesn't"", and that the very idea of ""alternative"" treatments is paradoxical because any treatment proven to work is by definition ""medicine.""


=== Different types of definitions ===
Some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare. This can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from medical scientists regarding access to research funding, sympathetic coverage in the medical press, or inclusion in the standard medical curriculum. In 1993, the British Medical Association (BMA) stated that it referred to ""...those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions, and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses"". In a US context, a definition coined in 1993 by the Harvard-based physician David M. Eisenberg described alternative medicine as ""interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals"". In a definition published in 2000 by the World Health Organization (WHO), CAM was defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system. A widely used descriptive definition devised by the US NCCIH calls it ""a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine"". However, these descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present-day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training; alternative medicine is taught in more than half of US medical schools and US health insurers are increasingly willing to provide reimbursement for alternative therapies. In 1999, 7.7% of US hospitals reported using some form of alternative therapy; this proportion had risen to 37.7% by 2008. A 15-year systematic review published in 2022 on the global acceptance and use of CAM among medical specialists found the overall acceptance of CAM at 52% and the overall use at 45%.
An expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the US Office for Alternative Medicine (OAM), devised a theoretical definition of alternative medicine as ""a broad domain of healing resources ... other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period"". This definition has been widely adopted, and has been cited by the UK Department of Health, attributed as the definition used by the Cochrane Collaboration, and, with some modification, was preferred in the 2005 consensus report of the US Institute of Medicine. This definition, an expansion of Eisenberg's 1993 formulation, is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies. Its proponents hold that it thus avoids relativism about differing forms of medical knowledge and, while it is an essentially political definition, this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream medicine is solely due to political forces. According to this definition, alternative and mainstream medicine can only be differentiated with reference to what is ""intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture"". However, there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and subcultures, nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate, nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity. If the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs, the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population.
Evidence-based definitions distinguish alternative medicine based on its provision of therapies that are unproven, unvalidated, or ineffective and support of theories with no recognized scientific basis. These definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when, used independently or in place of evidence-based medicine, they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine, but are not based on evidence gathered with the scientific method. Exemplifying this perspective, a 1998 editorial co-authored by Marcia Angell, a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, argued that:

It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.
This line of division has been subject to criticism on the grounds that not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit, and that most conventional therapies, if proven to be ineffective, would not later be classified as alternative. Another definition is that alternative medicine refers to a diverse range of related and unrelated products, practices, and theories ranging from biologically plausible practices and products and practices with some evidence, to practices and theories that are directly contradicted by basic science or clear evidence, and products that have been conclusively proven to be ineffective or even toxic and harmful.
Proponents of an evidence-base for medicine such as the Cochrane Collaboration take a position that all systematic reviews of treatments, whether ""mainstream"" or ""alternative"", ought to be held to the current standards of scientific method. In 2011, the Cochrane Collaboration proposed that indicators of a therapy's level of acceptance include government licensing of practitioners, coverage by health insurance, statements of approval by government agencies, and recommendation as part of a practice guideline; and that if something is currently a standard, accepted therapy, then it is not likely to be widely considered as alternative.


==== Australia ====
The public information website maintained by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of the Commonwealth of Australia uses the acronym ""CAM"" for a wide range of health care practices, therapies, procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine. In the Australian context this is stated to include acupuncture; aromatherapy; chiropractic; homeopathy; massage; meditation and relaxation therapies; naturopathy; osteopathy; reflexology, traditional Chinese medicine; and the use of vitamin supplements.


==== Denmark ====
The Danish National Board of Health's Council for Alternative Medicine (Sundhedsstyrelsens Råd for Alternativ Behandling (SRAB)), an independent institution under the National Board of Health (Danish: Sundhedsstyrelsen), uses the term ""alternative medicine"" for:

Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals.
Treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals, but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system. People without a healthcare authorisation are [also] allowed to perform the treatments.


== Other terms ==


=== Allopathic medicine ===

Allopathic medicine or allopathy is a pejorative term used by proponents of alternative medicine to refer to modern scientific systems of medicine, such as the use of pharmacologically active agents or physical interventions to treat or suppress symptoms or pathophysiologic processes of diseases or conditions.  The expression was coined in 1810 by the creator of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843). Among homeopaths and other alternative medicine advocates, the expression ""allopathic medicine"" is still used to refer to ""the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine.""
Use of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other alternative medicine practices. The meaning implied by the label has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative by some. William Jarvis, an expert on alternative medicine and public health, states that ""although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle"" and that the label ""allopath"" was ""considered highly derisive by regular medicine.""
Many modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Samuel Hahnemann's definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the cause of disease.

Oilfield scale inhibition,"Oilfield scale inhibition is the process of preventing the formation of scale from blocking or hindering fluid flow through pipelines, valves, and pumps used in oil production and processing. Scale inhibitors (SIs) are a class of specialty chemicals that are used to slow or prevent scaling in water systems. Oilfield scaling is the precipitation and accumulation of insoluble crystals (salts) from a mixture of incompatible aqueous phases in oil processing systems. Scale is a common term in the oil industry used to describe solid deposits that grow over time, blocking and hindering fluid flow through pipelines, valves, pumps etc. with significant reduction in production rates and equipment damages. Scaling represents a major challenge for flow assurance in the oil and gas industry. Examples of oilfield scales are calcium carbonate (limescale), iron sulfides, barium sulfate and strontium sulfate. Scale inhibition encompasses the processes or techniques employed to treat scaling problems.


== Background ==

The three prevailing water-related problems that upset oil companies today are corrosion, gas hydrates and scaling in production systems. The reservoir water has a high composition of dissolved minerals equilibrated over millions of years at constant physicochemical conditions. As the reservoir fluids are pumped from the ground, changes in temperature, pressure and chemical composition shift the equilibria and cause precipitation and deposition of sparingly soluble salts that build up over time with the potential of blocking vital assets in the oil production setups. Scaling can occur at all stages of oil/gas production systems (upstream, midstream and downstream) and causes blockages of well-bore perforations, casing, pipelines, pumps, valves etc. Severe scaling issues have been reported in Russia and certain North Sea production systems.


== Types of scales ==
Two main classifications of scales are known; inorganic and organic scales and the two types are mutually inclusive, occurring simultaneously in the same system, referred to as mixed scale. Mixed scales may result in highly complex structured scales that are difficult to treat. Such scales require aggressive, severe and sometimes costly remediation techniques. Paraffin wax, asphaltenes and gas hydrates are the most often encountered organic scales in the oil industry. This article focuses on the simplest and common form of scales encountered; inorganic scales.


=== Inorganic scale ===
Inorganic scales refer to mineral deposits that occur when the formation water mixes with different brines such as injection water. The mixing changes causes reaction between incompatible ions and changes the thermodynamic and equilibrium state of the reservoir fluids. Supersaturation and subsequent deposition of the inorganic salts occur. The most common types of inorganic scales known to the oil/gas industry are carbonates and sulfates; sulfides and chlorites are often encountered.
While the solubility of most inorganic salts (NaCl, KCl, ...) increases with temperature (endothermic dissolution reaction), some inorganic salts such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate have also a retrograde solubility, i.e., their solubility decreases with temperature. In the case of calcium carbonate, it is due to the degassing of CO2 whose solubility decreases with temperature as is the case for most of the gases (exothermic dissolution reaction in water). In calcium sulfate, the reason is that the dissolution reaction of calcium sulfate itself is exothermic and therefore is favored when the temperature decreases (then, the dissolution heat is more easily evacuated; see Le Chatelier's principle). In other terms, the solubility of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate increases at low temperature and decreases at high temperature, as it is also the case for calcium hydroxide (portlandite), often cited as a didactic case study to explain the reason of retrograde solubility.


=== Calcium carbonate scale ===
Water, noted for its high solvation power can dissolve certain gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) to form aqueous CO2(aq). Under the right conditions of temperature and/or pressure, H2O and CO2(aq) molecules react to yield carbonic acid (H2CO3) whose solubility increases at low temperature and high pressure.  The slightest changes in pressure and temperature dissolves H2CO3(aq) in water according to equation (3) to form hydronium and bicarbonate (HCO3−(aq)) ions.

CO2(aq) + H2O(l) ↔ H2CO3(aq)
H2CO3(aq) ↔  H+(aq) + HCO3−(aq)
2 HCO3−(aq) ↔ CO32−(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Ca2+(aq) + CO32−(aq) ↔ CaCO3(s)
The two reactions (2) and (4) describe the equilibrium between bicarbonate ions (HCO3−), which are highly soluble in water and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) salt. According to Le Chatelier's principle, drilling operations and extraction of the oil from the well bore decreases the pressure of the formation and the equilibrium shifts to the right (3) to increase the production of CO2 to offset the change in pressure. After years of oil production, wells may experience significant pressure drops resulting in large CaCO3 deposits as the equilibrium shifts to offset the pressure changes.


=== Sulfate scales ===
Sulfates of Group (II) metal ions (M2+), generally decrease in solubility down the group. The most difficult scales to remove are those of Barium sulfate because of its high insolubility forming very hard scale deposits. A general representation of the reaction is summarized in reaction:
5. M2+(aq) + SO42−(aq) → MSO4(s)
Sulfate scale usually forms when formation water and injected seawater mix together. The relationship between these and the degree of supersaturation is crucial in estimating the amount of sulfate salts that will precipitate in the system. Seawater has a high concentration of sulfate ions and mixing with formation water with many Ca2+ and other M2+ ions in the formation water. Severe problems with sulfate scale are common in reservoirs where seawater has been injected to enhance oil recovery.
Due to its relatively high solubility in water, Calcium sulfate is the easiest sulfate scale to remove chemically as compared to strontium and barium sulfate. Scale crystals are initially dispersed in production systems until accumulation of stable crystals of insoluble sulfates and scale growth occur at nucleation centers. Uneven pipeline surfaces and production equipment such as pumps and valves cause rapid scale growth to levels that can block pipelines.
The scaling-tendency of an oil-well can be predicted based on the prevailing conditions such as pH, temperature, pressure, ionic strength and the mole fraction of CO2 in the vapor and aqueous phases. For instance the saturation index for CaCO3 scale is calculated using the formula;
Fs= {[Ca2+][CO32−]}/Ksp
Where Fs is the scale saturation ratio, defined as the ratio of the activity product to the solubility product of the salt. Activity is defined as the product of the activity coefficients and the concentrations of Ca2+ and SO42− ions. The ionic strength is a measure of the concentration of the dissociated ions dissolved in water also called as “total dissolved solids” (TDS).


== Scale remediation ==
Different oilfield scale remediation techniques are known but majority are based on three basic themes:

Sulfate ion sequestering from sea injection waters
Chemical or mechanical Scale removal/dissolution
Application of Scale Inhibitors (SIs) for scale prevention
The first two methods may be used for short-term treatment and effective for mild-scaling conditions, however, continuous injection or chemical scale squeeze treatment with SIs have been proven over the years to be the most efficient and cost-effective preventative technique.


=== Scale inhibitors ===

Scale inhibitors are specialty chemicals that are added to oil production systems to delay, reduce and/or prevent scale deposition. acrylic acid polymers, maleic acid polymers and phosphonates have been used extensively for scale treatment in water systems due to their excellent solubility, thermal stability and dosage efficiency. In the water treatment industry, the major classes of SIs have inorganic phosphate, organophosphorous and organic polymer backbones and common examples are PBTC (phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid), ATMP (amino-trimethylene phosphonic acid) and HEDP (1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid), polyacrylic acid (PAA), phosphinopolyacrylates (such as PPCA), polymaleic acids (PMA), maleic acid terpolymers (MAT), sulfonic acid copolymers, such as SPOCA (sulfonated phosphonocarboxylic acid), polyvinyl sulfonates. Two common oilfield mineral SIs are Poly-Phosphono Carboxylic acid (PPCA) and Diethylenetriamine- penta (methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP).
Inhibition of calcium carbonate scale deposition and crystal studies of its polymorphs have been conducted. Different SIs are designed for specific scaling conditions and biodegradability properties. The inhibitor molecules essentially bind ions in aqueous phase of production fluids that could potentially precipitate as scales. For instance, to bind positively charged ions in the water, anions must be present in the inhibitor molecular backbone structure and vice versa. Group (II) metal ions are commonly sequestered by SIs with the following functionalities;
- Phosphonate ions (-PO3H−)
- Phosphate ions (-OPO3H−)
- Phosphonate ions (-PO2H−)
- Sulphonate ions (-SO3−)
- Carboxylate ions (-CO2−)
A SI with a combination of two or more of these functional groups is more efficient in managing scale problems. Usually the sodium salts of the carboxylic derivatives are synthesized as the anionic derivatives and are known to be the most effective due to their high solubilities. Interactions of these functional groups tend to prevent the crystal growth sites using dissociated or un-dissociated groups. The dissociation state is determined by the pH of the system, hence knowledge of the pKa values of the chemicals are important for different pH environments. Again, the inhibition efficiency of the SI depends on its compatibility with other production chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors.


== Environmental considerations ==
Generally, the environmental impacts of SIs are complicated further by combination of other chemicals applied through exploratory, drilling, well-completion and start-up operations. Produced fluids, and other wastes from oil and gas operations with high content of different toxic compounds are hazardous and harmful to human health, water supplies, marine and freshwater organisms. For instance trails of increased turbidity resulting from oil and gas exploratory activities on the eastern shelf of Sakhalin in Russia have been reported with consequential adverse effects on salmon, cod and littoral amphipods.
Efforts to develop more environmentally friendly SIs have been made since the late 1990s and an increasing number of such SIs are becoming commercially available. Recent environmental awareness over the past 15 years has resulted in the production and application of more environmentally friendly SIs, otherwise called 'Green Scale Inhibitors' (GSI). These GSIs are designed to have reduced bio-accumulating and high biodegradability properties and therefore reduce pollution of the waters around oil production systems. Phosphate ester SIs, commonly employed for treating calcium carbonate scales are known to be environmentally friendly but poor inhibition efficiency. Release of SIs containing Nitrogen and Phosphorus distorts the natural equilibrium of the immediate water body with adverse effects on aquatic life.
Another alternative, polysaccharide SIs meet the requirements for environmentally friendly materials; they contain no Phosphorus or Nitrogen and are noted for their non-toxic, renewable, and biodegradable properties. Carboxymethyl inulin (CMI), which is isolated from the roots of Inula helenium has been used in oil exploration and its very low toxicity and crystal growth inhibition power has been reported for treating calcite scales. Examples of poorly biodegradable SIs such as the amino-phosphonate and acrylate-based SIs are being phased-out by stringent environmental regulations as demonstrated in the North sea by Norway zero discharge policy.
Another modern alternative to SI use for environmental protection is the development of materials or coatings that intrinsically resist formation of inorganic scale to begin with. A variety of strategies can be used to accomplish this aim, including engineering of wettability properties and engineering of epitaxial properties to prevent mineral growth or to make minerals easier to remove following growth. Recent work has demonstrated that some classes of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces can cause self-ejection of scale grown during evaporation

Architectural sculpture,"Architectural sculpture is the use of sculptural techniques by an architect and/or sculptor in the design of a building, bridge, mausoleum or other such project. The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture.  The concept overlaps with, or is a subset of, monumental sculpture.
It has also been defined as ""an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure.""
Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia.


== Egyptian ==

Modern understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on the religious monuments that have survived since antiquity, which are carved stone with post and lintel construction. These religious monuments dedicated to the gods or pharaohs were designed with a great deal of architectural sculpture inside and out:  engaged statues, carved columns and pillars, and wall surfaces carved with bas-reliefs. The classic examples of Egyptian colossal monuments (the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Abu Simbel temples, the Karnak Temple Complex, etc.) represent thoroughly integrated combinations of architecture and sculpture.
Obelisks, elaborately carved from a single block of stone, were usually placed in pairs to flank the entrances to temples and pyramids.
Reliefs are also common in Egyptian building, depicting scenes of everyday life and often accompanied by hieroglyphics.


== Assyro-Babylonian ==
The Fertile Crescent architectural sculptural tradition began when Ashurnasirpal II moved his capitol to the city of Nimrud around 879 BCE.  This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum (alabaster).  This fairly easy to cut stone could be quarried in large blocks that allowed them to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there.  The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief.  Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries.


== Indian ==


== Greco-Roman ==

The most significant Greek introduction, well before the Classical period, was pedimental sculpture, fitting in the long, low triangle formed by the pediment above the portico of Greek temples. This remained a feature of later Greek and Roman temples and was revived in the Renaissance, with many new examples, by then mostly on large public buildings, created in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Classical Greek architecture, like the prototypical Parthenon, incorporate architectural sculpture in a fairly narrow set of standard, formal building elements.  The names of these elements still comprise the usual vocabulary for discussion: the pediment, metope, frieze, caryatid, quadriga, acroteria, etc.
Greek examples of architectural sculpture are distinguished not only by their age but their very high quality and skilful technique, with rhythmic and dynamic modelling, figural compositions in friezes that continue seamlessly over vertical joints from one block of stone to the next, and mastery of depth and legibility.
The known Greek and Roman examples have been exhaustively studied, and frequently copied or adapted into subsequent neoclassical styles: Greek Revival architecture (usually the most strict), Neoclassical architecture, Beaux-Arts architecture with its exaggerated and romantic free interpretations of the vocabulary, and even Stalinist architecture like the Central Moscow Hippodrome adapted to a totalitarian aesthetic.  These re-interpretations are sometimes dubious; for instance, there are many modern copies of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, like the National Diet Building in Tokyo, despite the fact that all classical descriptions of the Mausoleum are vague.

=== United States ===

Not until about 1870 did the U.S. develop the talent, the economic power, and the taste for buildings grand enough to need architectural sculpture.  The Philadelphia City Hall, constructed 1871 through 1901, is recognized as the turning point, because of the approximately 250 sculptures planned for the building, the large finial of William Penn, and the practical effect of Alexander Milne Calder training many assistants there.
In the same years, H.H. Richardson began to develop his influential signature genre, which included romantic, medieval, and Romanesque stone carving.  Richard Morris Hunt became the first to bring the Parisian neo-classical École des Beaux-Arts style back to the United States, a style that depended on integrated figural sculpture and a highly ornamented building fabric for its aesthetic effect.  The Beaux-Arts style dominated for major public buildings between the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, through about 1912, the year of the San Francisco City Hall.  The need for sculptors saw the emergence of a small industry of carvers and modelers, and a professional organization, the National Sculpture Society.
The advent of steel frames and reinforced concrete encouraged, at first, more diverse building styles into the 1910s and 1920s.  The diversity of skyscraper Gothic, exotic ""revivals"" of Mayan and Egyptian, Stripped Classicism, Art Deco, etc. called for a similar diversity of sculptural approaches.  The use of sculpture was still expected, particularly for public buildings such as war memorials and museums.  In 1926 the pre-eminent American architectural sculptor, Lee Lawrie, with his longtime friend and collaborator architect Bertram Goodhue, developed perhaps the most sophisticated American examples at the Nebraska State Capitol and the Los Angeles Public Library.
Goodhue's premature death ended that collaboration.  The Depression, and the onset of World War II, decimated building activity.  The old building trades disbanded.  By the postwar years the aesthetic of architectural modernism had taken hold.  Except for a few diehards and regional sculptors, the profession was not only dead but discredited.  As of the 2010s there are isolated signs of a revival of interest, for instance in the career of Raymond Kaskey and the Persist statue in Sacramento, California.

Art history,"Art history is the study of objects of art in their historical development and stylistic contents; that is genre, design, format, and style. The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture and other decorative objects. An art historian is a person who studies the history of art, and then writes about it or teaches about it so that other people can learn about this subject as well.
The first person to become an art historian was Giorgio Vasari. He lived in Florence during the Renaissance, at a time when there were many famous artists alive. Vasari was an artist himself. He decided to write down all the stories that were told in Florence about the many different artists who had made the city famous. He included biographies of several other artists from Northern Italy as well. When all the information was collected and the biographies written, he published them in 1568 in a book called Lives of the Artists. Because of this book, art students today have a lot of information about artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian and their works.

Software safety classification,"Software installed in medical devices is assessed for health and safety issues according to international standards.


== Safety classes ==
Software classification is based on the potential for hazard(s) that could cause injury to the user or patient.
Per [[IEC 62304|IEC 62304:2006] + A1:2015], the software can be divided into three separate classes:

The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is software safety class A if:
the SOFTWARE SYSTEM cannot contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION; or
the SOFTWARE SYSTEM can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION which does not result in unacceptable RISK after consideration of RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM.
The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is software safety class B if:
the SOFTWARE SYSTEM can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION which results in unacceptable RISK after consideration of RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and the resulting possible HARM is non-SERIOUS INJURY.
The SOFTWARE SYSTEM is software safety class C if:
the SOFTWARE SYSTEM can contribute to a HAZARDOUS SITUATION which results in unacceptable RISK after consideration of RISK CONTROL measures external to the SOFTWARE SYSTEM and the resulting possible HARM is death or SERIOUS INJURY“


=== Serious injury ===
For the purpose of this classification, serious injury is defined as injury or illness that directly or indirectly is life-threatening; results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure; or necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.

Wood anatomy,"Wood anatomy is a scientific sub-area of wood science, which examines the variations in xylem anatomical characteristics across trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species to explore inquiries related to plant function, growth, and the environment.
Extensive study of the wood structure helps also in macroscopically or microscopically identifying the exact wood species for a variety of scientific, technical, historical, economical and other reasons. In recent years, wood anatomy also helps developing new techniques in preventing the illegal logging of forests, that is the harvest, transportation, purchase, or sale of timber in violation of laws, leading to a number of environmental issues such as deforestation, soil erosion and biodiversity loss.
Commonly studied features include the dimensions of lumens and the thickness of walls in the conducting cells (tracheids, vessels), fibers, and various ray properties. The structural attributes of each xylem anatomical feature are largely predetermined upon formation and significantly influence its functionality, encompassing the transport and storage of water, nutrients, sugars, hormones, and mechanical support provision.
These anatomical features are localized within (annual) growth rings, facilitating the establishment of intra-annual structure-function relationships and sensitivity to environmental fluctuations. However, generating large datasets of xylem anatomical data poses numerous methodological challenges.


== Main topics ==
The wood anatomy includes the study of the structure of the bark, cork, xylem, phloem, vascular cambium, heartwood and sapwood and branch collar.
The main topic is the anatomy of two distinct types of wood:

Softwoods
Hardwoods

In botanical terminology, softwoods are sourced from gymnosperms, primarily conifers, whereas hardwoods originate from angiosperms, specifically flowering plants. Within the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, softwoods are typically represented by needle-leaved evergreen trees such as pine (Pinus) and spruce (Picea), while hardwoods are predominantly composed of broadleaf, deciduous trees like maple (Acer), birch (Betula), and oak (Quercus).
The differentiation between softwoods and hardwoods extends beyond tree categorization to the cellular level. Softwoods exhibit a simpler basic wood structure, characterized by only two cell types and limited variation within these categories. In contrast, hardwoods display increased structural complexity owing to a higher number of fundamental cell types and a considerable degree of variability within these cell types. The primary distinguishing feature lies in the presence of vessel elements, also referred to as pores, which are characteristic of hardwoods and absent in softwoods.
Despite these disparities, softwoods and hardwoods share a cellular similarity – the majority of cells are non-living at maturity, even within the sapwood. These living cells at maturity, identified as parenchyma cells, are present in both softwoods and hardwoods.


== Databases ==
There are several databases relating to wood anatomy. One of them, InsideWood, is an online resource and database for wood anatomy, serving as a reference, research, and teaching tool. This database was created by several international researchers, members of the IAWA, mostly botanists, biologists and wood scientists. The database thousands of wood anatomical descriptions and nearly 66,000 photomicrographs of contemporary woods, along with more than 1,600 descriptions and 2,000 images of fossil woods.
Another very important database for wood anatomy, is the so-called, Delta Intkey.
In 2024, a new novel electronic device, named as The XyloTron, was fully developed at the Forest Products Laboratory for fast and reliable identification of wood.


== Historical background ==
The inception of wood anatomy traces its roots back to the 17th century, during which pioneering scientists such as Robert Hooke, Marcello Malpighi, Nehemiah Grew, and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek emerged as the first individuals to utilize simple light microscopes. Hooke, leveraging his high technical expertise, dedicated efforts to enhance the quality of microscopes, focusing particularly on optimizing illumination and refining control over height and angle. Ultimately, he achieved magnifications of up to 50×, conducting examinations on a diverse array of objects. In 1665, Robert C. Hooke authored the seminal work ""Micrographia,"" wherein he provided precise details concerning the porosity of charcoal and the structure of cork.
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, the third luminary in the field of microscopical plant anatomy, first delineated the characteristics of numerous hardwoods and certain softwoods. Through the utilization of his personally crafted and refined microscope lenses, van Leeuwenhoek demonstrated an exceptional ability to discern intricate details, including bordered pits, perforation rims in vessels, and a macrofibrillar substructure within the cell wall.
As early as the mid-19th century, there was a notable increase in attention directed towards the examination of the structure of woody cell walls. Von Mohl employing polarized light microscopy, was the first to articulate the lamellar composition of a wood cell wall. However, it is important to note that his initial description only differentiated between primary and secondary lamellae, with the recognition of the tertiary lamella occurring later, thanks to Theodor Hartig. Von Mohl also accurately depicted most structural aspects of bordered pits in conifers.Taking a chemical perspective on the woody cell wall, Payen introduced the term ""cellulose"" to describe one of its constituents, emphasizing its similarity to starch. Carl Nägeli subsequently identified the cell wall as comprising crystalline cellulose, while Mulder introduced the term ""lignin"" to describe another constituent distinct from cellulose.
The 20th century witnessed significant advancements in technology, influencing the wood anatomy area, and thus enabling a more detailed analysis of microstructural, chemical, and physiological characteristics. Irving W. Bailey using the application of conventional light microscopy and indirect methods such as polarization microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and staining techniques delved into the fine structure of wood tissues. Collaborating with his coworkers, Bailey established the uninucleate condition of fusiform cambial initials. He unveiled intricate details concerning the fine structure of the wood cell wall, particularly highlighting the non-cellulosic nature of the middle lamella. Contributions to the understanding of the fine structure of the wood cell wall were also made by Albert Frey-Wyssling and Reginald Dawson Preston, who employed light microscopy-based techniques. In parallel, Johannes Liese integrated his expertise in wood anatomy and decay mechanisms with extensive studies on wood protection.
The advent of the electron microscope in wood biology around 1950 marked a transformative moment, ushering in a new dimension for the study of structural wood anatomy. Walter Liese, in 1950, captured the inaugural electron micrograph of a pine bordered pit membrane at the Institute of Ernst and Helmut Ruska in Berlin. In 1986, Ernst Ruska was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his foundational contributions to electron optics and the design of the first electron microscope. This first  image distinctly reveals the central torus and peripheral margo fibrils of wood with remarkable clarity.
In the 21st century, wood anatomy is strongly being connected and inter-related with molecular biology. A significant milestone in molecular biology transpired between 2000 and 2020 with the accomplishment of sequencing entire genomes of trees. The comprehensive DNA sequences of forest trees marked their debut in 2006 with the publication of the Populus trichocarpa genome, followed by Eucalyptus grandis in 2014. Picea abies, as the inaugural conifer species, underwent sequencing in 2013. Subsequently, numerous other tree genomes have been successfully sequenced.

Wood grain,"Wood grain describes the 
alignment, 
texture and appearance of the wood 
fibres. This is often important in its effect on woodworking techniques (e.g. against the grain).
In describing the alignment of the wood in the tree a distinction may be made. Basic grain descriptions and types include:

straight - grain which runs in a single direction along the cut wood, a product of a straight growing tree
cross - grain in which some cells grow out from the major growth axis of the tree
spiral - grain which develops as the trunk of the tree twists in development
interlocked (roey grain) A step beyond spiral grain occurring when growth rings in a twisting trunk develop misaligned grain

In addition, there are a few special grain alignments. Their rarity often promotes the value of both the raw material, and the finished work it becomes a part of. These include:

bird's eye
quilted
fiddleback
curly
tiger
In describing the application of a woodworking technique to a given piece of wood, the direction of the technique might be:

with the grain
against the grain
across the grain

In a wider sense, the term grain may also be applied to the orientation of the cut, the way a given piece of wood has been sawn: 

flat-grain: flat-sawn or plain sawn,
edge grain: quarter-sawn or rift-sawn or straight-grained, and
end grain.",0

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detector,"The superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD or SSPD) is a type of optical and near-infrared single-photon detector based on a current-biased superconducting nanowire. It was first developed by scientists at Moscow State Pedagogical University and at the University of Rochester in 2001. The first fully operational prototype was demonstrated in 2005 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Boulder), and BBN Technologies as part of the DARPA Quantum Network.
As of 2023, a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector is the fastest single-photon detector (SPD) for photon counting.
It is a key enabling technology for quantum optics and optical quantum technologies. SNSPDs are available with very high detection efficiency, very low dark count rate and very low timing jitter, compared to other types of single-photon detectors. SNSPDs are covered by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) international standards. As of 2023, commercial SNSPD devices are available in multichannel systems in a price range of 100,000 euros.
It was recently discovered that superconducting wires as wide as 1.5 μm can detect single infra-red photons. This is important because optical lithography rather than electron lithography can be used in their construction. This reduces the cost for applications that require large photodetector areas. One application is in dark matter detection experiments, where the target is a scintillating GaAs crystal. GaAs suitably doped with silicon and boron is a luminous cryogenic scintillator that has no apparent afterglow and is available commercially in the form of large, high-quality crystals.


== Principle of operation ==
The SNSPD consists of a thin (≈ 5 nm) and narrow (≈ 100 nm) superconducting nanowire. The length is typically hundreds of micrometers, and the nanowire is patterned in a compact meander geometry to create a square or circular pixel with high detection efficiency. The nanowire is cooled well below its superconducting critical temperature and biased with a DC current that is close to but less than the superconducting critical current of the nanowire. A photon incident on the nanowire breaks Cooper pairs and reduces the local critical current below that of the bias current. This results in the formation of a localized non-superconducting region, or hotspot, with finite electrical resistance. This resistance is typically larger than the 50 ohm input impedance of the readout amplifier, and hence most of the bias current is shunted to the amplifier. This produces a measurable voltage pulse that is approximately equal to the bias current multiplied by 50 ohms. With most of the bias current flowing through the amplifier, the non-superconducting region cools and returns to the superconducting state. The time for the current to return to the nanowire is typically set by the inductive time constant of the nanowire, equal to the kinetic inductance of the nanowire divided by the impedance of the readout circuit. Proper self-resetting of the device requires that this inductive time constant be slower than the intrinsic cooling time of the nanowire hotspot.
While the SNSPD does not match the intrinsic energy or photon-number resolution of the superconducting transition edge sensor, the SNSPD is significantly faster than conventional transition edge sensors and operates at higher temperatures. A degree of photon-number resolution can be achieved in SNSPD arrays, through time-binning or advanced readout schemes.  Most SNSPDs are made of sputtered niobium nitride (NbN), which offers a relatively high superconducting critical temperature (≈ 10 K) which enables SNSPD operation in the temperature range 1 K to 4 K (compatible with liquid helium or modern closed-cycle cryocoolers).  The intrinsic thermal time constants of NbN are short, giving very fast cooling time after photon absorption (<100 picoseconds).
The absorption in the superconducting nanowire can be boosted by a variety of strategies: integration with an optical cavity, integration with a photonic waveguide or addition of nanoantenna structures.  SNSPD cavity devices in NbN, NbTiN, WSi & MoSi have demonstrated fibre-coupled device detection efficiencies greater than 98% at 1550 nm wavelength with count rates in the tens of MHz.
The detection efficiencies are optimized for a specific wavelength range in each detector. They vary widely, however, due to highly localized regions of the nanowires where the effective cross-sectional area for superconducting current is reduced.
SNSPD devices have also demonstrated exceptionally low jitter – the uncertainty in the photon arrival time – as low as 3 picoseconds at visible wavelengths.  Timing jitter increases as photon energy drops and has been verified out to 3.5 micrometres wavelength.  Timing jitter is an extremely important property for time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) applications.  Furthermore, SNSPDs have extremely low rates of dark counts, i.e. the occurrence of voltage pulses in the absence of a detected photon. In addition, the deadtime (time interval following a detection event during which the detector is not sensitive) is on the order of a few nanoseconds, this short deadtime translates into very high saturation count rates and enables antibunching measurements with a single detector.
For the detection of longer wavelength photons, however, the detection efficiency of standard SNSPDs decreases significantly. Recent efforts to improve the detection efficiency at near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths include studies of narrower (20 nm and 30 nm wide) NbN nanowires as well as extensive studies of alternative superconducting materials with lower superconducting critical temperatures than NbN (tungsten silicide, niobium silicide, molybdenum silicide and tantalum nitride).  Single photon sensitivity up to 10 micrometer wavelength has recently been demonstrated in a tungsten silicide SNSPD.  Alternative thin film deposition techniques such as atomic layer deposition are of interest for extending the spectral range and scalability of SNSPDs to large areas.  High temperature superconductors have been investigated for SNSPDs with some encouraging recent reports.  SNSPDs have been created from magnesium diboride with some single photon sensitivity in the visible and near infrared.
There is considerable interest and effort in scaling up SNSPDs to large multipixel arrays and cameras.  A kilopixel SNSPD array has recently been reported.  A key challenge is readout, which can be addressed via multiplexing or digital readout using superconducting single flux quantum logic.


== Applications ==
Many of the initial application demonstrations of SNSPDs have been in the area of quantum information, such as quantum key distribution and optical quantum computing. Other current and emerging applications include imaging of infrared photoemission for defect analysis in CMOS circuitry, single photon emitter characterization, LIDAR, on-chip quantum optics, optical neuromorphic computing, fibre optic temperature sensing, optical time domain reflectometry, readout for ion trap qubits, quantum plasmonics, single electron detection, single α and β particle detection, singlet oxygen luminescence detection, deep space optical communication, dark matter searches and exoplanet detection.  A number of companies worldwide are successfully commercializing complete single-photon detection systems based on superconducting nanowires, including Single Quantum, Photon Spot, Scontel, Quantum Opus, ID Quantique, PhoTec and Pixel Photonics.  Wider adoption of SNSPD technology is closely linked to advances in cryocoolers for 4 K and below, and SNSPDs have recently been demonstrated in miniaturized systems.

Isotropic bands,"In physiology, isotropic bands (better known as I bands) are the lighter bands of skeletal muscle cells (a.k.a. muscle fibers). Isotropic bands contain only actin-containing thin filaments. The thin filaments are placed between 2 myosin filaments and contain only the actin filaments of neighboring sarcomeres. Bisecting the I band and serving as an anchoring point for the two adjacent actin filaments is the Z disc. During muscle contraction, the I band will shorten, while an A band will maintain its width.


== Cellular anatomy ==
The darker bands within skeletal muscle, known as anisotropic bands (A bands), encompass both thick and thin filaments and constitute the central region of the sarcomere, extending across the H-zone. Collectively, the A bands and the I bands create the distinctive striped appearance of skeletal muscle tissue. Tropomyosin, a protein, shields the myosin-binding sites, hindering actin from binding to myosin. It attaches to troponin, which secures it in place. During muscle relaxation, the troponin-tropomyosin complex inhibits myosin heads from binding to the active sites on actin microfilaments. Troponin also possesses a calcium ion binding site. These two regulatory proteins cooperate in response to calcium levels, overseeing sarcomere contraction. During muscle contraction, tropomyosin shifts to expose the myosin-binding site on an actin filament, allowing the interaction between actin and myosin microfilaments to occur. The initiation of contraction involves calcium ions binding to troponin, prompting a reaction that displaces tropomyosin from the actin filament binding sites. Consequently, myosin heads can attach to these exposed sites, forming cross-bridges and initiating muscle contraction.

Euler–Bernoulli beam theory,"Euler–Bernoulli beam theory (also known as engineer's beam theory or classical beam theory) is a simple method to calculate bending of beams when a load is applied. This applies to  small deflections (how far something moves) of a beam without considering effects of shear deformations. Therefore, it can be considered a special case of the Timoshenko beam theory. It was first introduced around 1750. It gained popularity during the development of the Eiffel Tower and the Ferris wheel in the late 19th century. After that, it was used in many engineering fields including mechanical engineering and civil engineering. Although other advanced methods have been developed, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is still widely used because of its simplicity. 


== History ==

Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli were the first to put together the theory in 1750.
At the time, science and engineering were viewed differently than today. Mathematical theories such as the Euler-Bernoulli Beam theory were not trusted for practical engineering use. Bridges and buildings continued to be designed using the same methods until the late 19th century. This is when the Eiffel Tower and Ferris wheel showed the validity of the theory on a larger scale.

Pallet collar,"A pallet collar is a type of wooden packaging that works together with a classic wooden pallet or custom pallets.
The main difference in comparison to a normal wooden box is the possibility to collapse a pallet collar when not in use. As such, pallet collars have helped solve a problem in logistics. Pallet collars have increased in popularity worldwide in the past 20 years, with approximately 20,000,000 new collars manufactured each year worldwide.
Each of the pallet collars is stacked on one another to form a box type of packing, but because of the convenient design they provide several important benefits that have high value in the storage and transportation industry.


== Overview ==
With the growing popularity of containerized transportation by sea and land, there was an increased use of classic wooden pallets. To enhance transportation options for a wider range of products, pallet collars were introduced. 


== Design ==
A single pallet collar consists of four or six wooden boards (plastic boards can also be used) and four or six metallic hinges that are used to hold the boards together. These hinges allow every pallet collar to collapse in order to save space, which is the main difference between it and other boxes.
Pallet collars work together with classic and different types of pallets.


== Benefits of pallet collars ==

When quality pallet collars are used in the right way it is possible to optimise space both in warehouses and when they are transported. They provide fast and easy handling and assembling. Also, the access to the goods that are stored is ensured to be faster and easier.
When pallet collars are not used and there are no products in this packaging it is possible to collapse them. In comparison to wooden boxes, these save up to more than 80% of space.
Different types of products can be stored on pallets without the pallet collars, but they are still used in order to ensure safe multi-level both shelf and non-shelf storage which ensures warehouse optimisation.
Using pallet collars make it possible to store more types of products on pallets which would usually be stored in classic wooden boxes. For example, different friable products can be stored when a customised pallet is used.


== Downsides of pallet collars ==
If older or lower quality, pallet collars that are used for heavy and/or multiple objects can break which can lead to injury such as splinters.
And since most are made out of wood, they can be water damaged or get worn out very quickly if used for transporting heavy objects.


== Pallet collar construction ==
The way pallet collars are constructed ensures pallet collars that differ in heights and sizes in order can be used to adjust the needed capacity for different packaging needs.


=== Standardisation ===
Standard pallet collars are manufactured in four heights: 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm. By using the needed heights and combining them together it is possible to closely match every single package to particular products.
Three standard sizes are manufactured: 600×800 mm, 800×1200 mm and 1000×1200 mm. These standard sizes complement the majority of most commonly used standard pallets.


=== Customisation ===
In order to provide quality working conditions and efficiency it is possible to manufacture any custom height and size, which can provide precise packaging for any type of products.
Hinges can be customised too in order to provide better working conditions. For example, one side of the collar may open as a door, to provide easy access to stored goods.


=== Materials ===
Standard pallet collars are manufactured from plywood, which provides the necessary quality. OSB or plastic pallet collars are also often used. Each of the materials has advantages and disadvantages.


=== Avoiding risks ===
To form the needed packaging from pallet collars, only collars from one manufacturer should be stacked on one another. While the majority of manufacturers use standard sizes, minor differences can occur due to the technology used in manufacturing. Such differences can cause significant safety issues.


== Use in gardening ==
Pallet collars have become popular as a form of raised bed in home and allotment gardening.

SAGES Legacy Unifying Globulars and GalaxieS Survey,"The SLUGGS (SAGES Legacy Unifying Globulars and GalaxieS) survey is an astronomical survey of 25 (and 3 `bonus') nearby early-type (E and S0) galaxies. This survey uses a combination of imaging from Subaru/Suprime-Cam and spectroscopy from Keck/DEIMOS to investigate the chemo-dynamical properties of both the diffuse starlight and the globular cluster systems of the target galaxies.
Pilot data for the survey was obtained in 2006 and data acquisition was completed in 2017.
The SLUGGS project was so named in honor of the banana slug mascot of the University of California, Santa Cruz.


== SAGES ==
SAGES (Study of the Astrophysics of Globular Clusters in Extragalactic Systems) is an international network of researchers investigating the formation and evolution of globular clusters and their host galaxies, using observational facilities around the world, particularly the Keck and Subaru telescopes.  It was founded by 
Jean Brodie, Duncan Forbes, Aaron Romanowsky and Jay Strader. 


== Method ==
Deep wide-field imaging from Subaru/Suprime-Cam is used to identify and measure the positions of candidate globular clusters around each survey galaxy. Several (up to 6) DEIMOS masks are then created which include slits corresponding to the locations of globular clusters, galaxy starlight and random background sky locations in the outer parts of the mask. 
The DEIMOS spectrograph, on the Keck telescope, is centred on wavelengths around the Calcium Triplet lines (~850 nm). After a typical 2 hour exposure per mask, spectra of globular clusters and galaxy starlight is obtained.  
Using a technique called SKiMS (Stellar Kinematics from Multiple Slits) it is possible to extract the kinematics (and metallicity) of galaxy starlight out to 3 effective radii. Equivalent data for the globular clusters is obtained out to ~10 effective radii. The DEIMOS instrument has the advantages of being a stable, high throughput, wide-field spectrograph coupled with excellent velocity resolution (~12 km/s) on a 10m telescope. This technique effectively uses DEIMOS as a pseudo wide area integral field unit.


== Survey selection ==
The 25 target galaxies are chosen to be representative (i.e. cover the range of basic galaxy parameters and environments) of nearby (distance < 27 Mpc) early type (E and S0) galaxies. The survey also includes 3 `bonus’ galaxies which have been observed during times that the main sample galaxies are not available. All galaxies are accessible from the northern hemisphere. Although only a small sample, the data reach to large galactocentric radii with excellent velocity resolution and S/N compared to other surveys.


== Key science questions ==
What are the basic, global chemo-dynamical properties of early type galaxies?
What is the distribution of dark matter in early-type galaxies?
How are the outer regions of early-type galaxies assembled?
How does assembly depend on mass, environment, and other variables?
Do the observations agree with theoretical models of galaxy formation?


== Target galaxies ==
NGC 720, NGC 821, NGC 1023, NGC 1400, NGC 1407, NGC 2768, NGC 2974, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 3608, NGC 4111, NGC 4278, NGC 4365, NGC 4374, NGC 4459, NGC 4473, NGC 4474, NGC 4486, NGC 4494, NGC 4526, NGC 4564, NGC 4649, NGC 4697, NGC 5846, NGC 7457.
The bonus galaxies are NGC 3607, NGC 4594 and NGC 5866.

Fruit carving,"Fruit carving is the art of carving fruit, a very common  technique  in Europe and Asian countries,  and particularly popular in Thailand, China and Japan. There are many fruits that can be used in this process; the most popular one that artists use are watermelons, apples, strawberries, pineapples, and cantaloupes.


== History ==


=== China ===
Many believe that fruit carving originated in China during the Tang Dynasty, which lasted from AD 618-906. Fruit carving in China usually features legendary creatures, and animals. Not only is fruit carving used in cultural and traditional ceremonies, but also ordinary households are known for decorating plates with fruit carvings when they have guests over.  Specifically, watermelon carving has been and still is very popular in China. Usually, the outside of the melon is carved on and the melon pulp is scraped out of the inside of the melon, so it can be used as a container to put food or flowers in. Chinese fruit carving is used to tell their legends and stories.


=== Europe ===
Fruit carving is included in Matthias Giegher's 1621 work Il Trinciante (""The Carver""), where he describes carving oranges and citrons into abstract patterns, shell-fish, four-legged animals and the Habsburgs' double-headed eagle, but the art was not common in Europe or North America until the 1980s when several books on the topic were published.


=== Thailand ===

Fruit carving is a significant part of Thai cultural heritage. Watermelon carving dates to the 14th century in Thailand during the Sukhothai dynasty. The annual Loi Krathong Festival occurs each November where people in Thailand float lamps and lanterns down a river to honor water spirits. One legend is that one of the king's maids decorated her lantern with a watermelon carved with flower designs to impress him and that he was so pleased that he encouraged all Thai women to adopt the practice. The king also requested that fruit carving become part of the primary school curriculum. Thailand fruit carving features flowers, birds and floral patterns.


=== Japan ===
The Japanese emphasize the presentation of a dish and how the plate aesthetically appeals to others. Fruit carving in Japan is referred to as Mukimono. Mukimono began in ancient Japan in an effort to make dishes more appealing since the food was placed and served on an unglazed pottery plate, which had a rough look to it. Chefs would cover the plate in leaves and would fold them into different designs in order to make the dish look better. This technique eventually turned into carving fruit that would also be placed on the plates to enhance the appearance of the dish. At first, when this technique came out, vendors on the streets would add carved fruit to their food when customers made a special request, but now it is very common for all Japanese dishes to feature carved fruits. Fruit carving and garnishing is now a significant part of Japanese chef training.


== Overview ==

The art of fruit carving uses many different   tools,  usually ordinary items but some   specific to just fruit carving. All these tools give the artwork a different texture or help with its design. Some of the tools  include:

Pen: to draw on the carving one wishes to make
Carving Knife: most commonly used for giving the carving shape
Peel Zester: this tool is used to create strips and grooves
Melon Baller: can be used for a variety of fruit to add ball shaped fruit carvings to the display
U-shaped garnish tool: used to cut the outer layer of the fruit. This tool is used for fine detailed work. Many fruit carvers use this tool to create a pedals for a flower shape they are carving.
V-shaped formed cutter: is used in a similar way as the U-shaped garnish tool but for larger carving ideas.
Before carving a fruit, the necessary materials must be gathered. The usual process is to have the tools handy for when they are needed in one's steps towards creating a carving. There are two types of carvings that can be done. The first is Skin Carving, this is when the outer skin of the fruit (or vegetable) is carved to reveal the fleshy center, where the color is different than the outer skin to create a design using the contrast between the outer skin and flesh of the fruit. The second type of carving is Three Dimensional Carving, the purpose of this particular technique of carving is to carve the fruit into a three dimensional object of the carver's choice. The most popular three dimensional design is floral objects. It is easy to over-carve a fruit which leads to loss in nutrition, but it is always important to start off by outlining your carving on the fruit. Depending on the design that is being created it may take very little time or be more complex and use more time and concentration also different steps in the process are used for each design. Not one design is alike. An important aspect of fruit carving is that the fruit you carve must be suitable for the manner which one will display it. Most fruit carvings will need to be refrigerated before they are placed in the specific setting that is desired.


== Fruit carving today ==
Some people perform fruit carving professionally. Some chefs utilize fruit carving as a culinary technique. Once fruit carvers have mastered the techniques past the intermediate stage and become professionals, they can price their services to restaurants, professional caterers, hotels and resorts. Professional fruit carvers can also create centerpieces and displays for various events, such as parties and wedding receptions. On a smaller scale, fruit carvers can present a dish with decorative garnishing to add an aesthetically pleasing experience to their viewers.

Figure (wood),"In wood, figure refers to the appearance of wood, as seen on a longitudinal surface (side-grain).


== Description ==

In wood, figure refers to the appearance of wood, as seen on a longitudinal surface (side-grain). A figured wood is not plain.
The figure of a particular piece of wood is, in part, due to its grain and, in part, due to the cut, or to innate properties of the wood.


== Types ==

Instructional animation,"Instructional animations are animations that are used either to provide instructions for immediate performance of a task or to support more permanent learning of subject matter. While both of these uses can be described as instructional animations, when the goal is to support learning, the term educational animation may be preferred.",1
Queensland Wood Reference Collection,"The Wood Reference Collection is a Queensland Government scientific collection based in Queensland, Australia. It is the oldest xylotheque (also known as a xylarium) of authenticated wood specimens in Australia and the third largest in the nation. It consists of 21 separate collections of wood block samples, including 17 international collections, and a glass slide collection of timber microstructure sections. Together, they provide a comprehensive reference collection of anatomical characteristics for Queensland timbers, and some national and international timbers.
The Wood Reference Collection supports activities integral to the:

Biosecurity Act 2015
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012


== History and current use ==
The Wood Reference Collection was first established in the 1880's as a legacy of Australia sending wood samples to international exhibitions to promote their timber exports. The Wood Reference Collection is the only xylarium in Australia still in use for the identification of wood specimens. It is also the only public collection for the accurate identification of processed wood. The services of the collection are open for government and the public (on a fee-for-service basis), helping to ascertain the provenance of any processed wood piece, including furniture, cultural products or architecture, among others. In Queensland, the expertise connected to the collection is regularly used for insurance investigations, forensic examination and to assure compliance with trade and import laws.
The collection includes:

almost 13,000 wood samples representing 200 plant genera
more than 9,000 samples of Queensland tree species
almost 5,000 microscope slides of stained timber microstructure sections from 108 plant families
slides showing a transverse section, a radial longitudinal section and a tangential longitudinal section for each species.


== Importance of the collection ==
The Wood Reference Collection is a unique collection of mainly Queensland timbers assembled by government botanists collecting plant materials since the 1880s. Once a tree has been removed from its environment and the wood has been processed, it can often be hard to identify the provenance or age of a specific piece. The wood blocks and microscope samples held at the Wood Reference Collection are invaluable as the provenance of a specific piece can influence how its value is determined.
In art history, the wood used by specific artists or furniture makers (for antiques) is often very characteristic. The frame of a painting or the type of wood used to make a stool can give crucial information when investigating whether an object is genuine or a replica.   
Similarly, anthropological studies on cultural objects or forensic studies on weapons often benefit from wood identification services. Specific cultures might have favoured specific wood types for ritual purposes, giving a clue as to the use of found objects. The Queensland Police Service Ballistic Unit have used the collection to identify the type and origin of wooden firearm stocks, and archaeologists working on structures such as a heritage listed timber bridge in Beaudesert, Queensland, the Wickham Terrace Tower Mill (The Old Windmill, Brisbane), the Cato (1800 ship) (wrecked on the Wreck Reefs) and many others have also benefitted from wood identification services.

Kepler's laws,"Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three laws that describe the motion  of planets around the sun:

Planets move around the sun in elliptic orbits. The sun is in one of the two foci of the orbit.
A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
Johannes Kepler found these laws, between 1609 and 1619. 


== Comparison to Copernicus ==
Kepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:

The planetary orbit is a circle
The Sun at the center of the orbit
The speed of the planet in the orbit is constant
The eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the rules above give good approximations of planetary motion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus's.
Kepler's corrections are not at all obvious:

The planetary orbit is not a circle, but an ellipse.
The Sun is not at the center but at a focal point of the elliptical orbit.
Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the area speed is constant.
The eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days.  A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the sun parallel to the equator of the earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately

which is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit).
The calculation is correct when perihelion, the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21",0
Theological aesthetics,"Theological aesthetics is the interdisciplinary study of theology and aesthetics, and has been defined as being ""concerned with questions about God and issues in theology in the light of and perceived through sense knowledge (sensation, feeling, imagination), through beauty, and the arts"". This field of study is broad and includes not only a theology of beauty, but also the dialogue between theology and the arts, such as dance, drama, film, literature, music, poetry, and the visual arts.
Notable theologians and philosophers that have dealt with this subject include Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, Jonathan Edwards, Søren Kierkegaard, Karl Barth, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and David Bentley Hart among others.
Theological aesthetics has recently seen rapid growth as a subject for discussions, publications, and advanced academic studies.


== Aesthetics in Christian theology ==


=== The early church ===
Theological writings during the period of the early Christian church which deal with aesthetics span from circa 160 to c. 650 and include writings by Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, Augustine of Hippo, Pseudo-Dionysius, Gregory of Nyssa, and Maximus the Confessor, among others. Prevalent themes during this period included ""the vision of God or of God's glory, the image of God in Christ and in us, and the concern with idol worship"".


=== The medieval church ===
During the Middle Ages, Western theologians such as Anselm of Canterbury, John Scotus Eriugena, Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, Nicholas of Cusa, and Bernard of Clairvaux touched upon themes such as ""the idea of beauty, the vision of God, the image of Christ, the iconodule-iconoclast conflict, and the strong presence of personally grounded and poetic doxologies"".


=== The Reformation ===
Concerning aesthetics, the theologians of the 16th century Protestant Reformation (Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli) dealt primarily with ""the theology of the image, in particular, idolatry and iconoclasm"".


=== The 17th–19th centuries ===
Theological aesthetics increased in diversity during this period, with activity such as ""the composition of hymns in Protestant circles, Edwards' writing on beauty, the Romantic artists and intellectuals with their panentheist sensibilities, Schleiermacher's idea of religion as feeling and intuition, the decline of religious art, and the ground-breaking philosophical contributions of thinkers such as Burke, Baumgarten, Kant and Hegel.""


=== The 20th century ===
Some major themes which emerged and developed in the 20th century included the question of ""how art can function as a source of and in theology"" (Tillich, Rahner, Dillenberger), the question of ""the art work as a shaper of meaning in today's culture"" (Burch Brown, Cox, Küng), ""the essential role of imagination in theology"" (Lynch, McIntyre, Green), and the beauty of God (van der Leeuw, Barth, von Balthasar). Rookmaaker helpfully sought to provide a reformed Christian critique of art and aesthetics in the cultural and political upheavals of the 1960s in his book 'Modern Art and the Death of a Culture'.

Milicia excelsa,"Milicia excelsa is a tree species from the genus Milicia of the family Moraceae. Distributed across tropical Central Africa, it is one of two species (the other being Milicia regia) yielding timber commonly known as ọjị, African teak, iroko, intule, kambala, moreira, mvule, odum and tule.


== Description ==
The species is a large deciduous tree growing up to 50 metres (160 feet) high. The trunk is bare lower down with the first branch usually at least 20 m (66 ft) above the ground. It often has several short buttress roots at the base. The bark is pale or dark gray, thick but little fissured, and if it gets damaged it oozes milky latex. There are a few thick branches in the crown all fairly horizontal giving an umbrella shape. The smaller branches hang down in female trees and curve up in male trees. The leaves are 5 to 10 centimetres (2 to 4 inches) long, ovate or elliptical with a finely toothed edge, green and smooth above and slightly downy beneath. Older leaves turn yellow, and all of the leaves have a prominent rectangular mesh of veins visible on the underside. The trees are dioecious. Male trees have white catkins that extend 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) and dangle from twigs at the axils of the leaves. Female trees have flower spikes measuring 5 to 6 cm (2 to 2+1⁄4 in) long by 2 cm (3⁄4 in) wide, green with prominent styles. The fruit are long, wrinkled and fleshy with the small seeds embedded in the pulp.
There is evidence that some of the variation that is described above amongst individuals is due to the variation in the environment. In a study done in 2010, it was found that environmental change from different regions in Benin caused much of the variation in M. excelsa. Many studies have attributed this variation in growth to the differences in climate of regions. Specifically, soil characteristics and rainfall played a major role in the morphological variation of trunk growth of M. excelsa.


== Phylogeny ==
In a study it was seen that isolation was caused by one or more of the animals that are known for dispersal of M. excelsa (i.e. bats, rodents, and birds). It is hypothesized that the ancestor slowly developed a different flowering time from its ancestor, which led to differences in selection pressure during the time of reproduction. This, over time, has resulted in the tree that we see today commonly known as Iroko. Although this is the theory that has the most evidence, it is possible for M. excelsa to have evolved in a different way.


== Distribution and habitat ==
African teak is distributed across tropical West, East, and Central Africa. Its range extends from Guinea-Bissau in the west to Mozambique in the east. It is found in Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Its natural habitat is in wet savannah, rainforest, riverine and low-altitude evergreen forests. It can tolerate an annual rainfall of less than 70 cm (28 in) or six months of drought as long as there is a stream or a ground water source nearby.
In a study done on population distribution of M. excelsa in 2009, researchers found that most of the populations that were being studied were inbred. After some analysis the researchers found that the M. excelsa was inbreeding due to lack of proximity to other M. excelsa individuals. Inbreeding could contribute to why this species is moving closer to being on the Threatened conservation list. If the numbers of mates available are not high enough because dispersion methods are not effective over long distances, then the species will begin to suffer from inbreeding depression (inbreeding can lead to accumulation of recessive deleterious alleles in a population).


== Ecology ==
Flowering takes place at a range of different times, but often occurs in January and February soon after the time when most of the leaves fall or shortly before the new leaves appear. The fruits take about a month to ripen and are eaten by squirrels, bats, and birds, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some populations, especially plantations, are attacked by a gall mite.
A study in Ghana found that this tree relies heavily on the straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) for seed dispersal, over 98% of the seed falling to the ground having passed through its gut. This seed also germinated better than uneaten seed and resisted predation longer.


=== Importance to the environment ===
In a study done on the mineralization of M. excelsa, it was observed that in certain conditions Milicia acts as a carbon sink. These specific conditions are characterized by presence of oxalate, bacteria for oxalate oxidation and a dry season, which are common conditions in which Milicia tends to grow. This is important because the conversion of atmospheric carbon into land carbon decreases the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
Because of its importance to the environment there has been research done on how to conserve Iroko. A solution that has been proposed to help M. excelsa move further away from being threatened is agroforestry. It was found that agroforestry helps increase habitat for plants and animals. More importantly, agroforestry promotes the growth of any plant species by taking pressure off remnant forests that usually have to repopulate threatened species on their own. The people that conducted this study found that it would be a good method to use to specifically fight against the slow decline of the Iroko species. However, most of the people that were surveyed for the study did not use this system specifically to regenerate this species, therefore even though there is hope in helping this species the measures have not been taken to do so.
When forests are felled, isolated trees are often left standing and the tree regenerates easily. Fresh seed germinates readily but it loses viability in storage.


== Conservation ==
Because of these and many other uses of M. excelsa, people have over-harvested this species to the point of concern. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has this species on the Red List under 'Near Threatened'. A study has reported that most of the remaining Iroko trees in Benin were conserved on farms.
M. excelsa is threatened by habitat loss.


== Uses ==
Milicia excelsa is one of two tree species (the other being Milicia regia) that yield timber commonly known as African teak.
M. excelsa yields a strong, dense and durable dark brown hardwood timber. It is resistant to termites and is used for construction, furniture, joinery, panelling, floors and boats. Iroko has been used in recent refit work performed on the Royal Navy's 104-gun first-rate ship of the line HMS Victory.
The tree can be used in the control of erosion, and for providing shade as a roadside tree in urban areas. It grows rapidly, can be coppiced and is ready for cutting after about fifty years. The tree leaves are used for mulching.
The tree is also used in herbal medicine. The powdered bark is used for coughs, heart problems and lassitude. The latex is used as an anti-tumour agent and to clear stomach and throat obstructions. The leaves and the ashes also have medicinal uses.


== In culture ==
In West Africa, African teak is considered to be a sacred tree. It is often protected when the surrounding bush is cleared, ritual sacrifices take place underneath it and gifts are given to it. Fertility and birth are associated with it and its timber is used to make ceremonial drums and coffins.

Hard maple,"Acer saccharum, the sugar maple, is a species of flowering plant in the soapberry and lychee family Sapindaceae. It is native to the hardwood forests of eastern Canada and the eastern United States. Sugar maple is best known for being the primary source of maple syrup and for its brightly colored fall foliage. It may also be called ""rock maple,"" ""sugar tree,"" ""sweet maple,"" or, particularly in reference to the wood, ""hard maple,"" ""birds-eye maple,"" or ""curly maple,"" the last two being specially figured lumber. 


== Description ==
Acer saccharum is a deciduous tree normally reaching heights of 25–35 m (80–115 ft), and exceptionally up to 45 m (150 ft). A 10-year-old tree is typically about 5 m (20 ft) tall. As with most trees, forest-grown sugar maples form a much taller trunk and narrower canopy than open-growth ones.
The leaves are deciduous, up to 20 cm (7.9 in) long and wide, palmate, with five lobes and borne in opposite pairs. The basal lobes are relatively small, while the upper lobes are larger and deeply notched. In contrast with the angular notching of the silver maple, however, the notches tend to be rounded at their interior. The fall color is often spectacular, ranging from bright yellow on some trees through orange to fluorescent red-orange on others. Sugar maples also have a tendency to color unevenly in fall. In some trees, all colors above can be seen at the same time. They also share a tendency with red maples for certain parts of a mature tree to change color weeks ahead of or behind the remainder of the tree. The leaf buds are pointy and brown-colored. The recent year's growth twigs are green, and turn dark brown.
The flowers are in panicles of five to ten together, yellow-green and without petals; flowering occurs in early spring after 30–55 growing degree days. The sugar maple will generally begin flowering when it is between 10 and 200 years old. The fruit is a pair of samaras (winged seeds). The seeds are globose, 7–10 mm (9⁄32–13⁄32 in) in diameter, the wing 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) long. The seeds fall from the tree in autumn, where they must be exposed to 45 days of temperatures below 4 °C (39 °F) to break their coating down. Germination of A. saccharum is slow, not taking place until the following spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past.
It is closely related to the black maple, which is sometimes included in this species, but sometimes separated as Acer nigrum. The western sugar maple (Acer grandidentatum) and southern sugar maple ((Acer floridanum) are also treated as a varieties or subspecies of northern sugar maple by some botanists.
The sugar maple can be confused with the Norway maple, which is not native to America but is commonly planted in cities and suburbs, and they are not closely related within the genus. The sugar maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf petiole (the Norway maple has white sap), brown, sharp-tipped buds (the Norway maple has blunt, green or reddish-purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the Norway maple bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of the sugar maple have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the squarish lobes of the Norway maple.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Ecology ==
The sugar maple is an extremely important species to the ecology of many forests in the northern United States and Canada. Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of the northern and Midwestern U.S. hardwood forests. Due to its need for cold winters, sugar maple is mostly found north of the 42nd parallel in USDA growing zones 3–5. It is less common in the southern part of its range (USDA Zone 6) where summers are hot and humid; there sugar maple is confined to ravines and moist flatlands. In the east, from Maryland southward, it is limited to the Appalachians. In the west, Tennessee represents the southern limit of its range and Missouri its southwestern limit. Collection of sap for sugar is also not possible in the southern part of sugar maple's range as winter temperatures do not become cold enough.
The minimum seed-bearing age of sugar maple is about 30 years. The tree is long-lived, typically 200 years and occasionally as much as 300.
Sugar maple is native to areas with cooler climates and requires a hard freeze each winter for proper dormancy. In northern parts of its range, January temperatures average about −18 °C (0 °F) and July temperatures about 16 °C (61 °F); in southern parts, January temperatures average about 10 °C (50 °F) and July temperatures average almost 27 °C (81 °F). Seed germination also requires extremely low temperatures, the optimal being just slightly above freezing, and no other known tree species has this property. Germination of sugar maple seed in temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C) is rare to nonexistent.
Acer saccharum is among the most shade tolerant of large deciduous trees. Its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the striped maple, a smaller tree. Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy. Sugar maple can tolerate virtually any soil type short of pure sand, but does not tolerate xeric or swampy conditions.
Sugar maples are deeper-rooted than most maples and engage in hydraulic lift, drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers. This not only benefits the tree itself, but also many other plants growing around it. 
The mushroom Pholiota squarrosoides is known to decay the logs of the tree.
Human influences have contributed to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over. The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. Acid rain and soil acidification are some of the primary contributing factors to maple decline. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple's role as a street tree.
In some parts of New England, particularly near urbanized areas, the sugar maple is being displaced by the Norway maple. The Norway maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in the sugar maple's replacement in those areas. In addition, Norway maple produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species.


== Cultivation and uses ==


=== Maple syrup and other food use ===

The sugar maple is one of the most important Canadian trees, being, with the black maple, the major source of sap for making maple syrup. Other maple species can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but some have lower sugar content and/or produce more cloudy syrup than these two. In maple syrup production from Acer saccharum, the sap is extracted from the trees using a tap placed into a hole drilled through the phloem, just inside the bark. The collected sap is then boiled. As the sap boils, the water evaporates and the syrup is left behind. Forty gallons of maple sap produces 1 gallon of syrup. In the southern part of their range, sugar maples produce little sap; syrup production is dependent on the tree growing in cooler climates.
The samaras which are the seeds can be soaked, and—with their wings removed—boiled, seasoned, and roasted to make them edible. The young leaves and inner bark can be eaten raw or cooked.


=== Timber ===

The sapwood can be white, and smaller logs may have a higher proportion of this desirable wood. Bowling alleys and bowling pins are both commonly manufactured from sugar maple. Trees with wavy wood grain, which can occur in curly, quilted, and ""birdseye maple"" forms, are especially valued. Maple is also the wood used for basketball courts, including the floors used by the NBA, and it is a popular wood for baseball bats, along with white ash. In recent years, because white ash has become threatened by emerald ash borer, sugar maple wood has increasingly displaced ash for baseball bat production. It is also widely used in the manufacture of musical instruments, such as the members of the violin family (sides and back), guitars (neck), grand pianos (rim), and drum shells. It is also often used in the manufacture of sporting goods.
Canadian maple, often referred to as ""Canadian hardrock maple"", is prized for pool cues, especially the shafts. Some production-line cues will use lower-quality maple wood with cosmetic issues, such as ""sugar marks"", which are most often light brown discolorations caused by sap in the wood. The best shaft wood has a very consistent grain, with no marks or discoloration. Sugar marks usually do not affect how the cue plays, but are not as high quality as those without it. The wood is also used in skateboards, gunstocks, and flooring for its strength. Canadian hardrock maple is also used in the manufacture of electric guitar necks due to its high torsional stability and the bright, crisp resonant tone it produces. If the grain is curly, with flame or quilt patterns, it is usually reserved for more expensive instruments. In high-end guitars this wood is sometimes Torrefied to cook out the Lignin resins, allowing the greater stability to climate & environmental changes, and to enhance its tonal characteristics as the instrument's resonance is more evenly distributed across the cellulose structure of the wood without the lignin.


=== Urban planting ===

Sugar maple was a favorite street and park tree during the 19th century because it was easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful fall color. As noted above, however, it proved too delicate to continue in that role after the rise of automobile-induced pollution and was replaced by Norway maple and other hardier species. It is intolerant of road salt. Sugar Maples are commonly planted as a street tree in cities within the Mountain West region of the United States, usually a different cultivar such as the “Legacy” sugar maple. The shade and the shallow, fibrous roots may interfere with grass growing under the trees. Deep, well-drained loam is the best rooting medium, although sugar maples can grow well on sandy soil which has a good buildup of humus. Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support sugar maple growth. Poorly drained areas are unsuitable, and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats. Its salt tolerance is low and it is very sensitive to boron. The species is also subject to defoliation when there are dense populations of larvae of Lepidoptera species like the rosy maple moth (Dryocampa rubicunda).

=== Use by Native Americans ===
The Mohegan use the inner bark as a cough remedy, and the sap as a sweetening agent, and to make maple syrup following the introduction of metal cookware by Europeans.


== Big trees ==

The United States national champion for Acer saccharum is located in Charlemont, Massachusetts. In 2007, the year it was submitted, it had a circumference of 5.92 metres (233 in; 19 ft 5 in) at 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) above the ground's surface, and thus a diameter at breast height of about 1.88 metres (6 ft 2 in). At that time the tree was 34.1 metres (111 ft 11 in) tall with an average crown spread of 27.7 metres (90 ft 11 in). Using the scoring system of circumference in inches plus height in feet plus 25% of crown spread in feet resulted in a total number of 368 points at the National Register of Big Trees. A tree in Lyme, Connecticut, measured in 2012, had a circumference of 18 ft 3 in; 6 m, or an average diameter at breast height of about 5.8 feet (5 ft 10 in; 1.8 m). This tree had been 123 feet (37 m) tall with a crown spread of 86 feet (26 m), counting for a total number of 364 points.


== In popular culture ==

The sugar maple is the state tree of the US states of New York, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.
It is depicted on the state quarter of Vermont, issued in 2001.

Bot,"A bot is a computer program which acts automatically. It may do things that a person wouldn't normally do, or take a long time to do.  It is an automated or semi-automated tool or script. They may be simple, or advanced and complex:

Software agents acts for a user doing things which the user programs it for. Software agents which interact with people (such as chatbots) have features which make this possible, such as natural language processing.
More advanced agents:
Intelligent agents can use artificial intelligence.
Autonomous agents change the way they do things to achieve the same objectives. Also, there are multi-agent systems which can work together to get a result which could not be done by a single agent.
Mobile agents can move (relocate) their working to different processors.


== Issues with bots ==
Societies are going through a rapid learning process at present. The freedom of bots to mine data is challenged. By mining data is meant collecting information about use, and about users, so as to advance some commercial or other purpose. In the European Union, for example, bots must now ask for permission to mine data from users. Before, they could collect any data they liked from users inorder to promote the welfare of the companies that used them.
There is a Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases. It is a directive of the European Union in the field of copyright law, made under the Treaty of Rome. The need to protect the data of users is a more recent development. 
Data mining is certain to be extremely important in the future. On Wikipedia the use of bots is frequent (see link above), but the use of data mining is minimal.

Mesocyclone,"A mesocyclone is a vortex of air, about 2 to 10 km in diameter (the mesoscale of meteorology), inside a convective storm.
That is, it is air that rises and rotates around a vertical axis, usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, related with a localized low pressure area inside a severe thunderstorm. Such storms can create strong surface winds and a lot of hail. Mesocyclones often happen together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. 
The word mesocyclone originated around 1970–75; meso- + cyclone] This word is first recorded in the period 1970–75. meso- is a combining form meaning “middle,” used in the formation of compound words.
Mesocyclones are normally relatively very small in size; they lie between the synoptic scale (hundreds of kilometers) and small scale (hundreds of meters).

Solar year,The solar year  (also called tropical year) is a calendar system based on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. The Gregorian Calendar is an example of a solar calendar. Each year is slightly more then 365 days in a solar calendar; which is why there are leap days every 4 years.,0
Timber slide,"A timber slide is a device for moving timber past rapids and waterfalls.  Their use in Canada was widespread in the 18th and 19th century timber trade.  At this time, cut timber would be floated down rivers in large timber rafts from logging camps to ports such as Montreal and Saint John, New Brunswick.  Rapids and waterfalls would, however, damage the wood and could potentially cause log jams.  Thus at these locations timber slides were constructed.  These were thin water filled chutes that would run parallel to the river.  They would usually only be wide enough for a single log and one at a time the logs would be directed down it.  The idea is attributed to Ruggles Wright who introduced the first one in 1829 not far from what is today down-town Hull, Quebec, Canada. Later, the slides could often be up to a kilometre in length. They were most commonly found on the Ottawa River system. The Bonnechere River in Eastern Ontario had five chutes along the waterway before emptying into the Ottawa River.
In some areas the timber slide became a tourist attraction, the most notable being the 1.2 km chute bypassing the Chaudière Falls on the Ottawa River in Ottawa. Its most notable visitors are the Duke of York, who later became King George V, and his wife, the Duchess of York Mary of Teck.
Timber slides disappeared after the construction of canal networks and the decline of the timber trade. They were almost all out of service by the First World War.

AquaFence,"AquaFence is a reusable temporary flood and hurricane barrier made by the Norwegian manufacturer AquaFence. It is an alternative to other temporary floodwater control such as sandbags and to the building of permanent seawalls.


== Design ==
The fencing consists of interlocking panels which are waterproof and puncture-resistant, can be bolted down to resist winds, and use the weight of floodwater to hold them in place. Materials include marine-grade laminate, stainless steel, aluminum and reinforced PVC canvas. The panels are reusable and can be stored flat between uses. The technology was designed as an alternative to building seawalls or placing sandbags in the path of floodwaters. 


== Deployment ==

An AquaFence was deployed at the Tees Barrage.
An AquaFence was deployed in Mount Vernon, Washington, in 2008.
Tampa, Florida's only Level I trauma center is at Tampa General Hospital, which sits directly on Tampa Bay at the northern end of the Davis Islands, which are one of the city's lowest-elevation areas. The hospital employs an AquaFence when a hurricane is forecast; erecting the fence requires 60 workers for three days. The fence the hospital uses can withstand storm surges of 15 feet (4.6 m) and wind speeds of 130 miles (210 km) per hour, which can handle a category 3 hurricane. The hospital used the fence for the first time during 2022's category 5 Hurricane Ian. During 2023's category 4 Hurricane Idalia the fence allowed about two feet of water through. It was also deployed during 2024's category 3 Hurricane Helene, successfully protecting the hospital. It was deployed for 2024's Hurricane Milton.
AquaFences have also been used to protect private properties such as luxury homes in flood-prone or hurricane-prone areas.

Theopoetics,"Theopoetics in its modern context is an interdisciplinary field of study that combines elements of poetic analysis, process theology, narrative theology, and postmodern philosophy. Originally developed by Stanley Hopper and David Leroy Miller in the 1960s and furthered significantly by Amos Wilder with his 1976 text, Theopoetic: Theology and the Religious Imagination.
In recent times there has been a revitalized interest with new work being done by two schools of thought in theopoetics.
One school values process theology and postmodern philosophy. It is led by individuals such as L. Callid Keefe-Perry, Rubem Alves, Catherine Keller, John Caputo, Peter Rollins, Scott Holland, Melanie May, Matt Guynn, Roland Faber, and others.
The other school of thought values the philosophical transcendentals as informed by classical theology. It is led by individuals such as Anne M. Carpenter of St. Mary’s College, California, and Richard Viladesau of Fordham University, with contributions from Brian Nixon of Veritas International University. This school of theo-poetics is influenced by the thought of Hans Urs von Balthasar as informed by a range of thinkers as divergent as Gregory of Nyssa, Thomas Aquinas, Maximus the Confessor, Dietrich Richard Alfred von Hildebrand, David Bentely Hart and Pavel Florensky.


== Description ==
Postmodern Theopoetics
The first school of theopoetics suggests that instead of trying to develop a ""scientific"" theory of God, as systematic theology attempts, theologians should instead try to find God through poetic articulations of their lived (""embodied"") experiences. It asks theologians to accept reality as a legitimate source of divine revelation and suggests that both the divine and the real are mysterious — that is, irreducible to literalist dogmas or scientific proofs.
Theopoetics makes significant use of ""radical"" and ""ontological"" metaphor to create a more fluid and less stringent referent for the divine. One of the functions of theopoetics is to recalibrate theological perspectives, suggesting that theology can be more akin to poetry than physics. It belies the logical assertion of the principle of bivalence and stands in contrast to some rigid Biblical hermeneutics that suggest that each passage of scripture has only one, usually teleological, interpretation. The dismissal of the aesthetic as a living part of language has turned the academic enterprise of biblical studies and theology into a language more at home with lawyers than poets. Theopoetics is the art of using words and thoughts that speak to the reader in an aesthetic and existential way to inspire spirituality in the reader.
Whereas those who utilize a strict, historical-grammatical approach believe scripture and theology possess inerrant factual meaning and pay attention to historicity, a theopoetic approach takes an allegorical position on faith statements that can be continuously reinterpreted. Theopoetics suggest that just as a poem can take on new meaning depending on the context in which the reader interprets it, texts and experiences of the Divine can and should take on new meaning depending on the changing situation of the individual.
Classical Theopoetics
In the second school of theopoetics, the aim is drawn “from von Balthasar’s affirmation of poetic expression: when God speaks to us in the Incarnation, all qualities of human language—even being itself—are employed as created ‘grammar’ by which God expresses himself to us…With God at the center of expression, poetry becomes capable of an authentic role in theological language.”
This form of theo-poetics “requires the interplay of three massive fields of knowledge:  metaphysics, language, and Christology”  and is to be “sharply distinguished from the agnostic overtures of the ‘theo-poetics’ movement, whose lineage is not be found in the thought of Balthasar.”
The mythopoetics of the Oxford Inklings (C.S. Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Owen Barfield, Charles Williams, among others) would also be an example of classical theopoetics.   Charles Williams gave the name ""Romantic Theology"" to his project of establishing a subclass of theology at the intersection of imaginative, specifically romantic, literature and classical theology; however this subclass of theology is focused on romantic love between a couple as a way of loving God. C.S. Lewis fits poetry into a broader understanding of theology in his essay ""Is Theology Poetry?""  Others have called it Christian Romanticism, Mythopoetics or Theopoetics. Northwind Seminary offers a doctoral degree program in the Romantic Theology of the Oxford Inklings.  [www.NorthwindSeminary.edu]

Educational animation,"Educational animations are animations produced for the specific purpose of fostering learning. It is associated with educational technology with the way it supports teaching and learning through the use of technological tools to facilitate learning and to improve performance.


== Background ==

The popularity of using animations to help learners understand and remember information has greatly increased since the advent of powerful graphics-oriented computers. This technology allows animations to be produced much more easily and cheaply than in former years. Previously, traditional animation required specialised labour-intensive techniques that were both time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, software is now available that makes it possible for individual educators to author their own animations without the need for specialist expertise. Teachers are no longer limited to relying on static graphics but can readily convert them into educational animations.


== Animations for education ==
Educators are enthusiastically taking up the opportunities that computer animation offers for depicting dynamic content. For example, PowerPoint now has an easy-to-use animation facility that, in the right hands, can produce very effective educational animations. Because animations can explicitly depict changes over time (temporal changes), they seem ideally suited to the teaching of processes and procedures. When used to present dynamic content, animations can mirror both the changes in position (translation), and the changes in form (transformation) that are fundamental to learning this type of subject matter.
In contrast with static pictures, animations can show temporal change directly (rather than having to indicate it indirectly using auxiliary markings such as arrows and motion lines). Using animations instead of static graphics removes the need for these added markings so that displays can be not only simpler and less cluttered, but also more vivid, engaging, and more intuitively comprehended.  In addition, the learner does not have to interpret the auxiliary markings and try to infer the changes that they summarise. Such interpretation and inference may demand a level of graphicacy skills that the learner does not possess. With animated depictions, information about the changes involved is available to be read straight from the display without the learner needing to perform mental animation.  It's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's more like being kissed instead of reading about a kiss.

Research evidence about the educational effectiveness of animations is mixed. Various investigations have compared the educational effectiveness of static and animated displays across a number of content domains. While there have been some findings that show positive effects of animations on learning, other studies have found no effects or even negative effects. Some propose that the efficacy depends on the way the animation characteristics engages the psychological functioning of the learner. In general, it can be concluded that animations are not intrinsically more effective than static graphics. Rather, the particular characteristics of individual animations and how they are used to play a key role in the effects that they have on learning.


== Do animations make learning faster? ==
Well-designed animations may help students learn faster and easier. They are also excellent aid to teachers when it comes to explaining difficult subjects. The difficulty of subjects may arise due to the involvement of mathematics or imagination. For instance, the electric current is invisible. The operation of electric circuits is difficult for students to understand at the beginning. With the aid of computer animations, learning and teaching might become easier, faster and amusing.

According to V.M. Williamson and M.R. Abraham, animation helps students learn in two ways. It facilitates the creation of mental representations of concepts, phenomenon, and processes and it also replaces difficult cognitive processes (e.g. abstraction, imagination). There are also studies that revealed that learning is facilitated as animation create positive attitude among the learners, leading to positive learning outcomes. 


== Educational effectiveness ==
Animations may lack educational effectiveness if target learners can't process the presented information adequately.  For example, it seems that when the subject matter is complex, learners may be overwhelmed by animated presentations. This is related to the role of visual perception and cognition in human information processing. Our human perceptual and cognitive systems have limited capacities for processing information. If these limits are exceeded, learning may be compromised. For example, the pace at which the animation presents its information may exceed the speed at which the learner can process it effectively. The accompanying animation (part of a pumping system) is problematic for this reason. But the solution is obvious: slow the animation down and accompany it with a written explanation.  It is unlikely that superior learning is achieved by thoughtlessly substituting animation for a static graphic but by having it accompany textual explication.  Another suggestion for addressing such problems is to provide user control for the learner over how the animation plays. User controllable animations allow learners to vary aspects such as the playing speed and direction, labels and audio commentary to suit themselves.


== Perceptual salience versus thematic relevance ==
Complexity of the subject matter may not be the only reason for difficulties that learners sometimes have with animations. It seems that problems can also arise from the perceptual effects of such presentations. In a poorly designed animation, the information that learners notice most readily in the animation may not be the information that is of greatest importance. Conversely, information that is relatively inconspicuous may be very important.
Obviously, perceptibility of information does not necessarily correspond with its actual relevance to the learning task to be performed. Features of the animated display that are most conspicuous because of their contrast with the rest of the display are not always the best place for learners to direct their attention. In other words, there can be a poor correspondence between the perceptual salience ('noticeability') of a feature and its thematic relevance, and an accompanying text is needed to correct this.
This correspondence problem can occur with both static and animated graphics. On a purely perceptual level, our attention tends to be attracted by some parts of a static display more than by other parts due to their visuospatial properties. For example, an object that is centrally placed, relatively large, unusually shaped, and of a sharply contrasting colour or texture is likely to 'jump out' of the display so that we notice it very easily. Other items in the display may receive correspondingly less attention as a result. Well-designed static educational graphics take advantage of these perceptual effects. They manipulate the characteristics of the display in order to direct learner attention to the most relevant information. This helps to ensure that the learner will extract the required information from the display. There is a problem in the design of the animation shown above in this respect. Unfortunately, there are many 'educational' graphics being produced that fail to provide learners with sufficient support of this type.  Designers of animation need to take such consideration into account.


== Dynamic contrast ==
The correspondence problems due to perceptual characteristics of a display are compounded when we go from a static to an animated graphic. Because of their dynamic character, educational animations introduce a further challenge to information extraction beyond those found with static graphics. Certain aspects of a display that changes over time have the potential to capture learner attention. If there is sufficient dynamic contrast between one or more items in the display and their surroundings, the effect can be very compelling in a perceptual sense. It seems that a fundamental level, our perceptual system is attuned to detect and follow such changes, irrespective of their importance in terms of the subject matter. As with static displays discussed above, items that are perceptually compelling (in this case because of their dynamic character) may not necessarily be of great thematic relevance to the given learning task. The big orange float in the accompanying animation is far more perceptible than the small grey air valve because of both its visuospatial characteristics, and its high level of dynamic contrast with the rest of the display.
The misleading effects of the dynamic contrast are likely to be particularly problematic for learners who lack background knowledge in the content domain depicted in an animation. These learners can be largely in the thrall of the animation's raw perceptual effects and so tend to process the presented information in a bottom-up manner. For example, their attention within the display is likely to be directed to items that have conspicuous dynamic characteristics. As a result, there is a danger that they will attend to unimportant information merely because it is perceptually compelling. However, learners who already have considerable domain specific background knowledge are likely to be less influenced by perception alone. This is because their attention is also directed to a considerable extent by their knowledge of which aspects of the subject matter are of most relevance (irrespective of their perceptibility). As a result, their processing of information in the display has a more top-down character. In the pumping system animation example, the air valve would be noticed by those who are already familiar with pumps in general because their existing background knowledge would put them on the lookout for crucial (but visually insignificant) parts of the mechanism.

Dropsonde,"A dropsonde is a weather reconnaissance device created by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), designed to be dropped from an aircraft at altitude to more accurately measure (and therefore track) tropical storm conditions as the device falls to the ground. The dropsonde contains a GPS receiver, along with pressure, temperature, and humidity (PTH) sensors to capture atmospheric profiles and thermodynamic data. It typically relays these data to a computer in the aircraft by radio transmission. The device's descent is usually slowed by a parachute, allowing for more readings to be taken before it reaches the water beneath.

Rattan,"Rattan, also spelled ratan (from Malay: rotan), is the name for roughly 600 species of Old World climbing palms belonging to subfamily Calamoideae. The greatest diversity of rattan palm species and genera are in the closed-canopy old-growth tropical forests of Southeast Asia, though they can also be found in other parts of tropical Asia and Africa. Most rattan palms are ecologically considered lianas due to their climbing habits, unlike other palm species. A few species also have tree-like or shrub-like habits.
Around 20% of rattan palm species are economically important and are traditionally used in Southeast Asia in producing wickerwork furniture, baskets, canes, woven mats, cordage, and other handicrafts. Rattan canes are one of the world's most valuable non-timber forest products. Some species of rattan also have edible scaly fruit and heart of palm. Despite increasing attempts in the last 30 years at commercial cultivation, almost all rattan products still come from wild-harvested plants. Rattan supplies are now rapidly threatened due to deforestation and overexploitation. Rattan were also historically known as Manila cane or Malacca cane, based on their trade origins, as well as numerous other trade names for individual species.


== Description ==

Most rattan palms are classified ecologically as lianas because most mature rattan palms have a vine-like habit, scrambling through and over other vegetation. However, they are different from true woody lianas in several ways. Because rattans are palms, they do not branch and they rarely develop new root structures upon contact of the stem with soil. They are monocots, and thus, do not exhibit secondary growth. This means the diameter of the rattan stem is always constant: juvenile rattan palms have the same width as when adult, usually around 2–5 centimetres (3⁄4–2 inches) in diameter, with long internodes between the leaves. This also means juvenile rattan palms are rigid enough to remain free-standing, unlike true lianas which always need structural support, even when young. Many rattans also have spines which act as hooks to aid climbing over other plants, and to deter herbivores. The spines also give rattans the ability to climb wide-diameter trees, unlike other vines which use tendrils or twining which can only climb narrower supports. Rattans have been known to grow up to hundreds of metres long. 

A few species of rattans are non-climbing. These range from free-standing tree-like species (like Calamus dumetosa) to acaulescent shrub-like species with short subterranean stems (like Calamus pygmaeus).
Rattans can also be solitary (single-stemmed), clustering (clump-forming), or both. Solitary rattan species grow into a single stem. Clustering rattan, on the other hand, develop clumps of up to 50 stems via suckers, similar to bamboo and bananas. These clusters can produce new stems continually as individual stems die. The impact of harvesting is much greater in solitary species, since the whole plant dies when harvested. An example of a commercially important single-stemmed species is Calamus manan.  Clustering species, on the other hand, have more potential to become sustainable if the rate of harvesting does not exceed the rate of stem replacement via vegetative reproduction.
Rattans display two types of flowering: hapaxanthy and pleonanthy. All the species of the genera Korthalsia, Laccosperma, Plectocomia, Plectocomiopsis, and Myrialepis are hapaxanthic; as well as a few species of Calamus. This means they only flower and fruit once then die. All other rattan species are pleonanthic, being able to flower and fruit continually. Most commercially harvested species are pleonanthic, because hapaxanthic rattans tend to have soft piths making them unsuitable for bending.


== Taxonomy ==

Calamoideae includes tree palms such as Raffia (raphia) and Metroxylon (sago palm) and shrub palms such as Salacca (salak) (Uhl & Dransfield 1987 Genera Palmarum). The climbing habit in palms is not restricted to Calamoideae, but has also evolved in three other evolutionary lines—tribes Cocoseae (Desmoncus with c. 7–10 species in the New World tropics) and Areceae (Dypsis scandens in Madagascar) in subfamily Arecoideae, and tribe Hyophorbeae (climbing species of the large genus Chamaedorea in Central America) in subfamily Ceroxyloideae. They do not have spinose stems and climb by means of their reflexed terminal leaflets. Of these only Desmoncus spp. furnish stems of sufficiently good quality to be used as rattan cane substitutes.
There are 13 different genera of rattans that include around 600 species. Some of the species in these ""rattan genera"" have a different habit and do not climb, they are shrubby palms of the forest undergrowth; nevertheless they are close relatives to species that are climbers and they are hence included in the same genera. The largest rattan genus is Calamus, distributed in Asia except for one species represented in Africa. From the remaining rattan genera, Korthalsia, Plectocomia, Plectocomiopsis, and Myrialepis are centered in Southeast Asia with outliers eastwards and northwards; and three are endemic to Africa: Laccosperma (syn. Ancistrophyllum), Eremospatha and Oncocalamus.

Other traditional uses of rattans by species:


=== Etymology ===
The name ""rattan"" is first attested in English in the 1650s. It is derived from the Malay name rotan. Probably ultimately from rautan  (from raut, ""to trim"" or ""to pare"").


== Ecology ==
Many rattan species also form mutualistic relationships with ant species. They provide ant shelters (myrmecodomatia) like hollow spines, funnel-shaped leaves, or leaf sheath extensions (ochreae). The rattans in turn, gain protection from herbivores.


== Conservation ==
Rattans are threatened with overexploitation, as harvesters are cutting stems too young and reducing their ability to resprout. Unsustainable harvesting of rattan can lead to forest degradation, affecting overall forest ecosystem services. Processing can also be polluting. The use of toxic chemicals and petrol in the processing of rattan affects soil, air and water resources, and also ultimately people's health. Meanwhile, the conventional method of rattan production is threatening the plant's long-term supply, and the income of workers.
Rattans also exhibit rapid population growths in disturbed forest edges due to higher light availability than in the closed-canopy old-growth tropical forests. Although this can mean increased rattan abundance for economic exploitation, it can also be problematic in long-term conservation efforts.
Rattan harvesting from the wild in most rattan-producing countries requires permits. These include the Philippines, Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, Laos, Ghana, and Cameroon. In addition, the Philippines also imposes an annual allowable cut in an effort to conserve rattan resources. Rattan cultivation (both monoculture and intercropping) is also being researched and pioneered in some countries, though it is still a young industry and only constitutes a minority of the rattan resources harvested annually.


== Uses ==

In forests where rattan grows, its economic value can play a crucial role in conservation efforts. By offering an alternative source of income, rattan harvesting can deter loggers from engaging in timber logging. Harvesting rattan canes is simpler and requires less sophisticated tools compared to logging operations. Furthermore, rattan grows rapidly, which facilitates quicker replenishment compared to tropical wood species.This economic incentive supports forest maintenance by providing a profitable crop that complements rather than competes with trees. However, the long-term profitability and utility of rattan compared to other alternatives remain subjects of ongoing evaluation and study.
Cleaned rattan stems with the leaf sheaths removed are superficially similar to bamboo. Unlike bamboo, rattan stems are not hollow. Most (70%) of the world's rattan population exists in Indonesia, distributed among the islands Borneo, Sulawesi, and Sumbawa. The rest of the world's supply comes from the  Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Assam, India. 


=== Food source ===
Some rattan fruits are edible, with a sour taste akin to citrus. The fruit of some rattans exudes a red resin called dragon's blood; this resin was thought to have medicinal properties in antiquity and was used as a dye for violins, among other things. The resin normally results in a wood with a light peach hue. In the Indian state of Assam, the shoot is also used as vegetable.
The stem tips are rich in starch, and can be eaten raw or roasted. Long stems can be cut to obtain potable water. The palm heart can also be eaten raw or cooked.


=== Medicinal potential ===
In early 2010, scientists in Italy announced that rattan wood would be used in a new ""wood to bone"" process for the production of artificial bone. The process takes small pieces of rattan and places them in a furnace. Calcium and carbon are added. The wood is then further heated under intense pressure in another oven-like machine, and a phosphate solution is introduced. This process produces almost an exact replica of bone material. The process takes about 10 days. At the time of the announcement the bone was being tested in sheep, and there had been no signs of rejection. Particles from the sheep's bodies have migrated to the ""wood bone"" and formed long, continuous bones. The new bone-from-wood programme is being funded by the European Union. By 2023, experimental implants into humans were taking place.


=== Rattan chair ===

Rattans are extensively used for making baskets and furniture. When cut into sections, rattan can be used as wood to make furniture. Rattan accepts paints and stains like many other kinds of wood, so it is available in many colours, and it can be worked into many styles. Moreover, the inner core can be separated and worked into wicker. A typical braiding pattern is called Wiener Geflecht, Viennese Braiding, as it was invented in 18th century Vienna and later most prominently used by Thonet for their No. 14 chair.  
Generally, raw rattan is processed into several products to be used as materials in furniture making. From a strand of rattan, the skin is usually peeled off, to be used as rattan weaving material. The remaining ""core"" of the rattan can be used for various purposes in furniture making. Rattan is a very good material, mainly because it is lightweight, durable, and, to a certain extent, flexible and suitable for outdoor use.


=== Clothing ===
Traditionally, the women of the Wemale ethnic group of Seram Island, Indonesia wore rattan girdles around their waist.


=== Corporal punishment ===

Thin rattan canes were the standard implement for school corporal punishment in England and Wales, and are still used for this purpose in schools in Malaysia, Singapore, and several African countries. The usual maximum number of strokes was six, traditionally referred to as getting ""Six of the best"". Similar canes are used for military punishments in the Singapore Armed Forces. Heavier canes, also of rattan, are used for judicial corporal punishments in Aceh, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore.


=== Wicks ===
Rattan is the preferred natural material used to wick essential oils in aroma reed diffusers (commonly used in aromatherapy, or merely to scent closets, passageways, and rooms), because each rattan reed contains 20 or more permeable channels that wick the oil from the container up the stem and release fragrance into the air, through an evaporation diffusion process. In contrast, reeds made from bamboo contain nodes that inhibit the passage of essential oils.


=== Handicraft and arts ===
Many of the properties of rattan that make it suitable for furniture also make it a popular choice for handicraft and art pieces. Uses include rattan baskets, plant containers, and other decorative works.
Due to its durability and resistance to splintering, sections of rattan can be used as canes, crooks for high-end umbrellas, or staves for martial arts.  Rattan sticks 70 cm (28 inches) long, called baston, are used in Filipino martial arts, especially Arnis/Eskrima/Kali and for the striking weapons in the Society for Creative Anachronism's full-contact ""armoured combat"".
Along with birch and bamboo, rattan is a common material used for the handles in percussion mallets, especially mallets for keyboard percussion, e.g., marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, etc.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Shelter material ===
Most natives or locals from the rattan rich countries employ the aid of this sturdy plant in their home building projects. It is heavily used as a housing material in rural areas. The skin of the plant or wood is primarily used for weaving.


=== Sports equipment ===
Rattan cane is also used traditionally to make polo mallets, though only a small portion of cane harvested (roughly 3%) is strong, flexible, and durable enough to be made into sticks for polo mallets, and popularity of rattan mallets is waning next the more modern variant, fibrecanes.


=== Weaponry ===

Fire-hardened rattan were commonly used as the shafts of Philippine spears collectively known as sibat. They were fitted with a variety of iron spearheads and ranged from short throwing versions to heavy thrusting weapons. They were used for hunting, fishing, or warfare (both land and naval warfare). The rattan shafts of war spears are usually elaborately ornamented with carvings and metal inlays. Arnis also makes prominent use of rattan as ""arnis sticks"", commonly called yantok or baston. Their durability and weight makes it ideal for training with complex execution of techniques as well as being a choice of weapon, even against bladed objects.
 Rattan shields were historically used in ancient, medieval and early modern China and Korea. According to some contemporary sources, they were reasonably effective against both arrows and early firearms. 
It sees also prominent use in battle re-enactments as stand-ins to potentially lethal weapons.
Rattan can also be used to build a functional sword that delivers a non-lethal but similar impact compared to steel counterparts.

Fire,"Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.
At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.
Fire, in its most common form, has the potential to result in conflagration, which can lead to physical damage, which can be permanent, through burning. Fire is a significant process that influences ecological systems worldwide. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.
Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. When fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall can contribute to increased soil erosion by water. Additionally, the burning of vegetation releases nitrogen into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which can be recovered as atmospheric nitrogen is fixed and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning or by leguminous plants such as clover, peas, and green beans.
Fire is one of the four classical elements and has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.


== Etymology ==
The word ""fire"" originated from Old English  Fyr 'Fire, a fire', which can be traced back to the Germanic root *fūr-, which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European *perjos from the root *paewr- 'fire'. The current spelling of ""fire"" has been in use since as early as 1200, but it was not until around 1600 that it completely replaced the Middle English term fier (which is still preserved in the word ""fiery"").


== History ==


=== Fossil record ===

The fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land-based flora in the Middle Ordovician period, 470 million years ago, permitting the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere as never before, as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product. When this concentration rose above 13%, it permitted the possibility of wildfire. Wildfire is first recorded in the Late Silurian fossil record, 420 million years ago, by fossils of charcoalified plants. Apart from a controversial gap in the Late Devonian, charcoal is present ever since. The level of atmospheric oxygen is closely related to the prevalence of charcoal: clearly oxygen is the key factor in the abundance of wildfire. Fire also became more abundant when grasses radiated and became the dominant component of many ecosystems, around 6 to 7 million years ago; this kindling provided tinder which allowed for the more rapid spread of fire. These widespread fires may have initiated a positive feedback process, whereby they produced a warmer, drier climate more conducive to fire.


=== Human control of fire ===


==== Early human control ====

The ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans. Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing pathogenic microorganisms in the food. The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates. Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay. Evidence of occasional cooked food is found from 1 million years ago. Although this evidence shows that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago, other sources put the date of regular use at 400,000 years ago. Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time. The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, as it was used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from tens of thousands of years ago.
Fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution, as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot, which could be filled with water, oil, or even lead and then heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer.

By the Neolithic Revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management. These fires were typically controlled burns or ""cool fires"", as opposed to uncontrolled ""hot fires"", which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable. Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. For small farmers, controlled fires are a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil. However, this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth's surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere – and thus feed back into more fires. Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometres – an area more than half the size of the United States – burns in a given year.


==== Later human control ====

There are numerous modern applications of fire. In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on Earth in a controlled setting every day. Users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive. Thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity by igniting fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas, then using the resultant heat to boil water into steam, which then drives turbines.


==== Use of fire in war ====
The use of fire in warfare has a long history. Fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons. The Byzantine fleet used Greek fire to attack ships and men.
The invention of gunpowder in China led to the fire lance, a flame-thrower weapon dating to around 1000 CE which was a precursor to projectile weapons driven by burning gunpowder.
The earliest modern flamethrowers were used by infantry in the First World War, first used by German troops against entrenched French troops near Verdun in February 1915. They were later successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War.
Hand-thrown incendiary bombs improvised from glass bottles, later known as Molotov cocktails, were deployed during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. Also during that war, incendiary bombs were deployed against Guernica by Fascist Italian and Nazi German air forces that had been created specifically to support Franco's Nationalists.
Incendiary bombs were dropped by Axis and Allies during the Second World War, notably on Coventry, Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and Dresden; in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires. The United States Army Air Force also extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses. The incendiary fluid napalm was used in July 1944, towards the end of the Second World War, although its use did not gain public attention until the Vietnam War.


==== Fire management ====

Controlling a fire to optimize its size, shape, and intensity is generally called fire management, and the more advanced forms of it, as traditionally (and sometimes still) practiced by skilled cooks, blacksmiths, ironmasters, and others, are highly skilled activities. They include knowledge of which fuel to burn; how to arrange the fuel; how to stoke the fire both in early phases and in maintenance phases; how to modulate the heat, flame, and smoke as suited to the desired application; how best to bank a fire to be revived later; how to choose, design, or modify stoves, fireplaces, bakery ovens, or industrial furnaces; and so on. Detailed expositions of fire management are available in various books about blacksmithing, about skilled camping or military scouting, and about domestic arts.


==== Productive use for energy ====

Burning fuel converts chemical energy into heat energy; wood has been used as fuel since prehistory. The International Energy Agency states that nearly 80% of the world's power has consistently come from fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal in the past decades. The fire in a power station is used to heat water, creating steam that drives turbines. The turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity. Fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly by thermal expansion, in both external and internal combustion engines.
The unburnable solid remains of a combustible material left after a fire is called clinker if its melting point is below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools, and ash if its melting point is above the flame temperature.


== Physical properties ==


=== Chemistry ===

Fire is a chemical process in which a fuel and an oxidizing agent react, yielding carbon dioxide and water. This process, known as a combustion reaction, does not proceed directly and involves intermediates. Although the oxidizing agent is typically oxygen, other compounds are able to fulfill the role. For instance, chlorine trifluoride is able to ignite sand.
Fires start when a flammable or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.
Once ignited, a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion and may propagate, provided there is a continuous supply of an oxidizer and fuel.
If the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire. Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and extinguish the fire. Because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight. This does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.

Fire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron. Consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stove-top burner. The fire can be extinguished by any of the following:

turning off the gas supply, which removes the fuel source;
covering the flame completely, which smothers the flame as the combustion both uses the available oxidizer (the oxygen in the air) and displaces it from the area around the flame with CO2;
application of an inert gas such as carbon dioxide, smothering the flame by displacing the available oxidizer;
application of water, which removes heat from the fire faster than the fire can produce it (similarly, blowing hard on a flame will displace the heat of the currently burning gas from its fuel source, to the same end); or
application of a retardant chemical such as Halon (largely banned in some countries as of 2023) to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.
In contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion. Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire's own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst, a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.


=== Flame ===

A flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products. In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of ""fire"". This light has a continuous spectrum. Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame. Usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (HCl). Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of ""Green Dragon"".

The glow of a flame is complex. Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra.

The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame). There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.


==== Typical adiabatic temperatures ====

The adiabatic flame temperature of a given fuel and oxidizer pair is that at which the gases achieve stable combustion.

Oxy–dicyanoacetylene 4,990 °C (9,000 °F)
Oxy–acetylene 3,480 °C (6,300 °F)
Oxyhydrogen 2,800 °C (5,100 °F)
Air–acetylene 2,534 °C (4,600 °F)
Blowtorch (air–MAPP gas) 2,200 °C (4,000 °F)
Bunsen burner (air–natural gas) 1,300 to 1,600 °C (2,400 to 2,900 °F)
Candle (air–paraffin) 1,000 °C (1,800 °F).


== Fire science ==
Fire science is a branch of physical science which includes fire behavior, dynamics, and combustion. Applications of fire science include fire protection, fire investigation, and wildfire management.


== Fire ecology ==

Every natural ecosystem on land has its own fire regime, and the organisms in those ecosystems are adapted to or dependent upon that fire regime. Fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, each at a different stage of succession. Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape.


== Prevention and protection systems ==

Wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns. Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn. Controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.
Fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires. Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.
Fire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition. Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires. Buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire. Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.
Model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire. The most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers. To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability. Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.
Where fire prevention and fire protection have failed to prevent damage, fire insurance can mitigate the financial impact.

How Fire Works at HowStuffWorks
What exactly is fire? from The Straight Dope
On Fire, an Adobe Flash–based science tutorial from the NOVA (TV series)
""20 Things You Didn't Know About... Fire"" from Discover magazine",1
Control of fire by early humans,"When humans first learned how to control fire, it was an important step in their culture. It allowed them to cook food and get warmth and protection. Making fire also allowed activity into the dark, and gave some protection from predators and insects.
The cooking of food was probably the most useful effect of fire. There are foods like nuts and fruits which do not need cooking, but others, such as root vegetables, mostly need cooking.
It is not known for sure when fire was first controlled by humans. Evidence for the use of fire by Homo erectus by about 400,000 years ago has wide scholarly support. Claims for the  earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range from 0.2 to 1.7 million years ago (mya).


== Evidence ==


=== East Africa ===
The earliest evidence of humans using fire comes from many archaeological sites in East Africa, like Chesowanja near Lake Baringo, Koobi Fora, and Olorgesailie in Kenya. The evidence at Chesowanja is the discovery of red clay shards that scientists estimate are 1.42 million years old. Scientists reheated some of the shards at the site, and found that the clay must have been heated to 400 °C to harden.
At Koobi Fora, there are archaeological sites with evidence of control of fire by Homo erectus 1.5 million years ago, with the reddening of sediment that can only come from heating at 200—400 °C. There is a hearth-like depression at a site in Olorgesailie, Kenya. Some very tiny charcoal was found, but it could have come from a natural brush fire.
In Gadeb, Ethiopia, fragments of welded tuff that seemed to have been burned were found in Locality 8E, but re-firing of the rocks may have happened because of volcanoes erupting nearby. These have been found among  Herculean artifacts made by H. erectus.
In the Middle Awash River Valley, cone-shaped depressions of reddish clay were found that could be made by temperatures of 200 °C. These features are thought to be burned tree stumps such that they would have fire away from their habitation site. There are also burnt stones in the ""Awash Valley"", but volcanic welded tuff is also in the area.


=== Southern Africa ===
The earliest certain evidence of human control of fire was found at Swartkrans, South Africa. Many burnt bones were found among Acheulean tools, bone tools, and bones with cut marks that were made by hominids. This site also shows some of the earliest evidence of H. erectus eating meat. The Cave of Hearths in South Africa has burned deposits dated from 0.2 to 0.7 mya, as do many other places such as Montagu Cave (0.058 to 0.2 mya and at the Klasies River Mouth (0.12 to 0.13 mya.
The most powerful evidence comes from Kalambo Falls in Zambia where many things related to the use of fire by humans had been found, like charred wood, charcoal, reddened areas, carbonized grass stems and plants, and wooden implements which may have been hardened by fire. The place was dated through radiocarbon dating to be at 61,000 BP and 110,000 BP through amino acid racemization.
Fire was used to heat silcrete stones to increase their works before they were knapped into tools by Stillbay culture. This clue shows this not only with Stillbay sites that date back to 72,000 BP but sites that could be as old as 164,000 BP.


== Changes to behavior ==
An important change in the behavior of humans happened because of their control of fire and the light that came from the fire. Activity was no longer restricted to the daylight hours. Some mammals and biting insects avoid fire and smoke. Fire also led to better nutrition through cooked proteins.
Richard Wrangham of Harvard University argues that cooking of plant foods may have caused the brain to get bigger, because it made complex carbohydrates in starchy foods easier to digest. This allowed humans to absorb more calories from their food.


== Changes to diet ==
Stahl thought that because some parts of plants, like raw cellulose and starch are hard to digest in uncooked form, they would likely not be a part of the hominid diet before fire could be controlled. These parts include stems, mature leaves, enlarged roots, and tubers. Instead, the diet was made up of the parts of the plants that were made of simpler sugars and carbohydrates such as seeds, flowers, and fleshy fruits. Another problem was that some seeds and carbohydrate sources are poisonous. Cyanogenic glycosides, which are in linseed, cassava, and manioc, amongst others, are made non-poisonous through cooking. The teeth of H. erectus and the wear on the teeth reflect the consumption of foods such as tough meats and crisp root vegetables.
The cooking of meat, as can be seen from burned and blackened mammal bones, makes the meats easier to eat. It is also easier to get the nutrition from proteins because the meat itself is easier to digest. The amount of energy needed to digest cooked meat is less than that needed for raw meat, and cooking gelatinizes collagen and other connective tissues as well, it ""opens up tightly woven carbohydrate molecules for easier absorption."" Cooking also kills parasites and food poisoning bacteria.

Thunder,"For the aircraft, see P-47 Thunderbolt and A-10 Thunderbolt II.

Thunder is a very loud sound that is made sometimes during a very big rain storm.
Thunder is so loud, it can be heard from a very far distance.
It can sound like a boom, a crash, or a rumble.
Thunder is made when lightning strikes.
The energy from the lightning heats up the air so much that it makes a kind of explosion.
When lightning is very near, thunder will be heard soon after the lightning flash, and the sound will be very loud.  If the lightning is farther away, the thunder will be a few seconds or many seconds after the lightning. People can guess how far away the lightning is by counting the number of seconds between the time they see the lightning and hear the thunder.

Social distancing,"Social distancing, also less confusingly called physical distancing is one way to help stop the spread of infection from viruses and bacteria between people. The goal is to lower the chance for an infection to spread from person to person. This can reduce the number of infected people at one time, which lowers the burden on health care. By lowering the number of people who get sick, lives can also be saved.
Social distancing works for infections that are spread by droplets (cough or sneeze), physical contact, contaminated surfaces, or in the air. Social distancing does not work well for infections that are spread through food, water, or insects.
Types of social distancing are:

closing schools
closing places of work
isolation
quarantine
cordon sanitaire
protective sequestration
canceling gatherings of people, such as sports or entertainment shows
travel restrictions
closing gyms, pools, or other such areas
encouraging people to stay at home
asking people to keep a certain distance between each other if they do need to interact
All of these may have negative effects on people. However, these may be preferred to the effects of a specific disease.

Software bug,"A software bug is a problem with the code in a computer program which makes it not work properly. They can cause inconvenience to the user and may make their computer crash or freeze. Most computer programs have bugs. A program that has a large number of bugs (or possibly a single or a few serious bugs) is said to be buggy.
Most bugs are caused by bad programming by the developer, but sometimes they can be caused by compiler problems.  When bugs are found, people send bug reports to the developer to tell them about the bug and let them fix it.
Sometimes, people say that their computer has a bug when something is wrong with it.  The problem is usually caused by a computer virus which is making their computer slow or do different things.
Some bugs are harmless, for example, many video games incorrectly allow objects to move through walls. Other bugs are more severe, for example, a bug in a navigation system that causes an airplane to explode, or the two bugs in the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine's control software, which caused it to produce far more radiation than intended, killing at least three people.


== Types of bugs ==


=== Buffer overflow ===
A buffer overflow happens when a program writes to or reads from an area of memory that it is not supposed to access.


=== Arithmetic overflow ===
An arithmetic overflow happens when a number contained in a variable is increased beyond the highest number that the variable allows. This will usually cause the number to reset back to zero.


=== Infinite loop ===
An infinite loop happens when a program enters a loop (a series of instructions that is repeated many times) and there is no way out of the loop. This can cause the program to freeze.


=== Roundoff errors ===
If a floating point variable doesn't have enough precision, the number stored in it can be inaccurate. This can cause various problems depending on the type of program, for example it could cause a navigation program to navigate to an unintended location, or distorted sound in an audio recording program.


=== Division by zero ===
Division by zero is an invalid math operation. If a program divides an integer by zero, it will crash. On Linux, the message displayed when this bug occurs is ""floating point exception"", even though floating point numbers were not involved. Floating point math sometimes allows division by zero. This will usually result in a special ""not a number"" value.


=== Clipping problems ===
In video games, clipping problems, also called collision detection problems, occur when an object passes through a barrier (such as a wall, floor, or ceiling) that it was not intended to pass through. This is a very common bug found throughout many video games. This can happen, for example, in Doom 2 when a crushed monster is resurrected by an arch-vile. Clipping problems can often be used as a time-saving tactic in speedruns, for example, in Super Mario 64 it is possible to skip walking up the spiral staircase in the castle by jumping through the ceiling.


=== Security bugs ===
Security bugs are bugs that allow an intruder to either gain access to the computer, or cause the computer to crash. Causing the computer to crash is called a denial-of-Service attack. Security bugs are considered especially important to fix because they might allow intruders to steal important information such as credit card numbers or passwords. Examples of security bugs include Heartbleed Archived 2014-04-07 at the Wayback Machine and Shellshock.


== Misbugs ==
A misbug is a bug that has been used as a feature. An example would be a bug in an Android phone that allows users to gain root access.


== Hardware bugs ==
Some bugs affect hardware (the physical parts of a computer) instead of software. For example, running the instruction lock cmpxchg8b eax on old Pentium processors would cause the processor to stop working until rebooted. Since hardware bugs are physical design flaws, they can not be corrected with a software update, although it may be possible to work around (hide) the bug with a software update, for example, by checking for the conditions that cause the bug or by rearranging data in a way that prevents the bug from occurring.

Resilience,"Resilience generally means the ability to recover from some shock or disturbance.  

There are different meanings for,

resilience in psychology: the mental ability to recover quickly from depression, illness or misfortune
resilience of a material: the physical property of material that can resume its shape after being stretched or deformed (elasticity)
resilience of a system: the ability of a system to recover from difficulties;toughness


== Psychology ==
Resilience is a term used in psychology to describe the capacity of people to cope with stress and catastrophe. It is also used to indicate a characteristic of resistance to future negative events. This psychological meaning of resilience is often contrasted with ""risk factors"".


== Materials ==
In physics and engineering, resilience is defined as the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically and then, upon unloading to have this energy recovered. In other words, it is the maximum energy per volume that can be elastically stored. It is represented by the area under the curve in the elastic region in the Stress-Strain diagram.

An example of a biomaterial which has a high resilience is articular cartilage, the substance lining the ends of bones in articulating joints such as the knee and hip.


== Systems ==


=== Ecology ===
In ecology, resilience has been defined in two competing fashions that emphasize two different aspects of stability.
One definition is the rate at which a system returns to a single steady or cyclic state following a perturbation. This definition of resilience assumes that behavior of a system remains within the stable domain that contains this steady state.
When a system can reorganize, that is shift from one stability domain to another, a more relevant measure of ecosystem dynamics is ecological resilience. It is a measure of the amount of change or disruption that is required to transform a system from being maintained by one set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures to a different set of processes and structures.
The second definition emphasizes conditions far from any steady-states, where instabilities can flip a system into another regime of behavior - i.e. to another stability domain. In this case resilience is measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control behavior. This type of resilience has been defined as ecological resilience.


=== Economic and business ===
Economic resilence is the ability of a local economy to retain function, employment and prosperity in the face of the perturbation caused by the shock of the loss of a particular type of local industry or employer.


=== Industrial and organisational safety ===
Within the broad domain of industrial safety, the term resilience has come into use to emphasise that safety must be proactive as well as reactive. Whereas conventional risk management approaches emphasise calculation of failure probabilities, resilience engineering looks for ways to strengthen the ability of organisations to create processes that are robust yet flexible.


=== Network ===
Resilience is the ability of the network to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation.
Resilient networks aim to provide acceptable service to applications:

ability for users and applications to access information when needed, e.g.:
Web browsing
distributed database access
All this is Not True
situational awareness
maintenance of end-to-end communication association, e.g.:
computer-supported cooperative work
video conference
teleconference (including VoIP calls)
operation of distributed processing and networked storage, e.g.:
ability for distributed processes to communicate with one another
ability for processes to read and write networked storage

Soil classification,"Soil classification means that one finds categories of soils that are based on general characteristics as well as criteria that decide about the use that is possible.
Soil classification can be approached from both the perspective of pedogenesis and from soil morphology. But in both cases interpretations do not vary widely.

Dunnage,"Dunnage is inexpensive or waste material used to load and secure cargo during transportation; more loosely, it refers to miscellaneous baggage, brought along during travel. The term can also refer to low-priority cargo used to fill out transport capacity which would otherwise ship underweight. 
In the context of shipping manufactured goods, dunnage refers to the packing material used as protective fill inside the carton, box or other type  container used to prevent the merchandise from being damaged during shipment. These materials include bubble wrap; wadded, crumpled or shredded paper; styrofoam; inflated air packs; and other materials.


== International laws ==
When a ship is unloaded, sometimes the dunnage may not be landed because of customs duties on imported timber or quarantine rules to prevent foreign insect pests from moving ashore, and as a result often the unwanted dunnage is later furtively jettisoned overside and adds to the area's driftwood problem. According to U.S. and International Law (MARPOL 73/78) it is illegal for ships to dump dunnage within 25 nautical miles (46 km) of the shore. Currently, the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), an international regulatory agency, mandates its 134 signatory countries to comply with the ISPM 15, which requires all dunnage to be heat-treated or fumigated with pesticides and marked with an accredited seal. There are several instances in which foreign insects have come ashore and caused devastation to the ecosystem, even ruining crops.


== Construction ==
In construction, dunnage is often scrap wood or disposable manufactured material whose purpose is to be placed on the ground to raise construction materials to allow access for forklifts and slings for hoisting, and to protect them from the elements.
Dunnage can also refer to a structural platform for mechanical equipment. Typically, these are open steel structures located on the roof of a building, consisting of steel beams supported on posts or bearing walls. They are used to raise equipment off the roof for various reasons, including maintenance access to both the roof surface and equipment itself, or to provide clearance to keep equipment out of any snow or rain that may collect on the roof. In this use, the dunnage is typically a permanent part of the building structure for the life of the equipment being supported.


== Dunnage bags ==

Dunnage bags are air-filled pouches that can be used to stabilize, secure and protect cargo during transportation. Dunnage bags are placed in the voids between the cargo items. Dunnage bags can be used in all modes of transportation; road, railway, ocean or air.
Dunnage bags can be used to protect and secure parts, but also as a cushion. It is more widely used in the automotive, aerospace, electronics industry, etc.
Originally rubber bags were used to brace pallets inside trucks. They evolved into kraft paper bags with a plastic-bag interior. As metal strapping has become less popular, many companies now use polyethylene- or vinyl-based bags because of their low cost. It is important to match the size of the bag to the void.
Starting in the 1950s, several US railroad freight carriers began rostering boxcars equipped with load-securing devices to prevent shifting during transit. These cars were usually labeled ""Damage Free"" or simply ""DF"". The interior equipment helped to eliminate the need for customer-supplied dunnage.
In the 21st century, Amazon began air-filling dunnage bags on site during packing in order to minimize environmental impact, shipping weight, and cost of packing materials.


== Ships ==
Dunnage for securing cargo in holds of ships has evolved from wooden boards forming ""cribs"" to modern mechanical, spring-loaded post-and-socket systems, exemplified by the ""pogo sticks"" used on US Navy Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ships which provide underway replenishment of stores, spares, repair parts, ammunition, ordnance, and liquids in cans and drums. Dunnage segregates cargo in the hold and prevents shifting of the cargo in response to ship motions.


== Shipbuilding ==
During the shipbuilding process, dunnage is commonly used to describe items such as welding machines, hoses, ladders, and scaffolding which are not part of the ship and will not remain aboard after it is completed.


== Miscellaneous uses of term ==
Outfitters and mule packers use the term dunnage when they transport freight, such as camping gear and food supplies, but do not carry passengers. In fishing net products ""dunnage"" may refer to a reinforcement of the edges of the net. It has historically been widely used in the United Kingdom for a sailor's personal belongings, as in, ""Stow your dunnage and report to the First Mate"".
Many manufacturing facilities use the term dunnage to refer to the containers and packaging used for their finished goods.  This can be anything from wood boxes or steel bins to wire baskets and plastic trays.  Commonly this packaging is designed specifically to hold the product being manufactured and is proprietary to that manufacturing facilities requirements. On some vessels, it is used as a euphemism for human waste.

Burl,"A burl (American English) or burr (British English) is a tree growth in which the grain has grown in a deformed manner. It is commonly found in the form of a rounded outgrowth on a tree trunk or branch that is filled with small knots from dormant buds. Burl formation is typically a result of some form of stress such as an injury or a viral or fungal infection. 
Burls yield a very peculiar and highly figured wood sought after in woodworking, and some items may reach high prices on the wood market. Poaching of burl specimens and damaging the trees in the process poses a problem in some areas.


== Description ==

A burl results from a tree undergoing some form of stress. It may be caused by an injury, virus or fungus. Most burls grow beneath the ground, attached to the roots as a type of malignancy that is generally not discovered until the tree dies or falls over. Such burls sometimes appear as groups of bulbous protrusions connected by a system of rope-like roots. Almost all burl wood is covered by bark, even if it is underground. Insect infestation and certain types of mold infestation are the most common causes of this condition.
In some tree species, burls can grow to great size. The largest, at 26 ft (8 m), occur in coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) and can engirdle the entire trunk; when moisture is present, these burls can grow new redwood trees. The world's second-largest burls can be found in Port McNeill, British Columbia. One of the largest burls known was found around 1984 in the small town of Tamworth, New South Wales. It stands 6.4 ft (2.0 m) tall, with an odd shape resembling a trombone. In January 2009, this burl was controversially removed from its original location, and relocated to a public school in the central New South Wales city of Dubbo.


== Use ==

Burls yield a very peculiar and highly figured wood, prized for its beauty and rarity. It is sought after by furniture makers, artists, and wood sculptors. There are a number of well-known types of burls (each from a particular species); these are highly valued and sliced into veneers for furniture, inlay in doors, picture frames, household objects, automobile interior paneling and trim, musical instruments, and woodturning.


== Working the Wood ==
The prized ""burr maple"" is not a species of a maple, but wood from a maple's burl (burr).
The famous birdseye maple of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) superficially resembles burr maple, but it is something else entirely.
Burl wood is very hard to work with hand tools or on a lathe, because its grain is twisted and interlocked, causing it to chip and shatter unpredictably. This ""wild grain"" makes burl wood extremely dense and resistant to splitting, which made it valued for bowls, mallets, mauls and ""beetles"" or ""beadles"" for hammering chisels and driving wooden pegs.


== Poaching ==
Because of the value of burls, ancient redwoods in national parks in the Western United States have recently been poached by thieves for their burls, including at Redwood National and State Parks. Poachers often cut off the burls from the sides of the trunks using chainsaws, which exposes the tree to infection and disease, or fell the entire tree to steal burls higher up. Because of the risk of poaching, Jeff Denny, the state park's redwood coast sector supervisor, encourages those buying burl to inquire where it came from and to ensure it was obtained legally. Legal acquisition methods for burl include trees from private land cleared for new development and from lumber companies with salvage permits.

Solar radio emission,"Solar radio emission refers to radio waves that are naturally produced by the Sun, primarily from the lower and upper layers of the atmosphere called the chromosphere and corona, respectively. The Sun produces radio emissions through four known mechanisms, each of which operates primarily by converting the energy of moving electrons into electromagnetic radiation. The four emission mechanisms are thermal bremsstrahlung (braking) emission, gyromagnetic emission, plasma emission, and electron-cyclotron maser emission. The first two are incoherent mechanisms, which means that they are the summation of radiation generated independently by many individual particles. These mechanisms are primarily responsible for the persistent ""background"" emissions that slowly vary as structures in the atmosphere evolve. The latter two processes are coherent mechanisms, which refers to special cases where radiation is efficiently produced at a particular set of frequencies. Coherent mechanisms can produce much larger brightness temperatures (intensities) and are primarily responsible for the intense spikes of radiation called solar radio bursts, which are byproducts of the same processes that lead to other forms of solar activity like solar flares and coronal mass ejections.


== History and observations ==

Radio emission from the Sun was first reported in the scientific literature by Grote Reber in 1944. Those were observations of 160 MHz frequency (2 meters wavelength) microwave emission emanating from the chromosphere. However, the earliest known observation was in 1942 during World War II by British radar operators who detected an intense low-frequency solar radio burst; that information was kept secret as potentially useful in evading enemy radar, but was later described in a scientific journal after the war. One of the most significant discoveries from early solar radio astronomers such as Joseph Pawsey was that the Sun produces much more radio emission than expected from standard black body radiation. The explanation for this was proposed by Vitaly Ginzburg in 1946, who suggested that thermal bremsstrahlung emission from a million-degree corona was responsible. The existence of such extraordinarily high temperatures in the corona had previously been indicated by optical spectroscopy observations, but the idea remained controversial until it was later confirmed by the radio data.
Prior to 1950, observations were conducted mainly using antennas that recorded the intensity of the whole Sun at a single radio frequency. Observers such as Ruby Payne-Scott and Paul Wild used simultaneous observations at numerous frequencies to find that the onset times of radio bursts varied depending on frequency, suggesting that radio bursts were related to disturbances that propagate outward, away from the Sun, through different layers of plasma with different densities. These findings motivated the development of radiospectrographs that were capable of continuously observing the Sun over a range of frequencies. This type of observation is called a dynamic spectrum, and much of the terminology used to describe solar radio emission relates to features observed in dynamic spectra, such as the classification of solar radio bursts. Examples of dynamic spectra are shown below in the radio burst section. Notable contemporary solar radiospectrographs include the Radio Solar Telescope Network, the e-CALLISTO network, and the WAVES instrument on-board the Wind spacecraft.
Radiospectrographs do not produce images, however, and so they cannot be used to locate features spatially. This can make it very difficult to understand where a specific component of the solar radio emission is coming from and how it relates to features seen at other wavelengths. Producing a radio image of the Sun requires an interferometer, which in radio astronomy means an array of many telescopes that operate together as a single telescope to produce an image. This technique is a sub-type of interferometry called aperture synthesis. Beginning in the 1950s, a number of simple interferometers were developed that could provide limited tracking of radio bursts. This also included the invention of sea interferometry, which was used to associate radio activity with sunspots.
Routine imaging of the radio Sun began in 1967 with the commissioning of the Culgoora Radioheliograph, which operated until 1986. A radioheliograph is simply an interferometer that is dedicated to observing the Sun. In addition to Culgoora, notable examples include the Clark Lake Radioheliograph, Nançay Radioheliograph, Nobeyama Radioheliograph, Gauribidanur Radioheliograph, Siberian Radioheliograph, and Chinese Spectral Radioheliograph. Additionally, interferometers that are used for other astrophysical observations can also be used to observe the Sun. General-purpose radio telescopes that also perform solar observations include the Very Large Array, Atacama Large Millimeter Array, Murchison Widefield Array, and Low-Frequency Array.

All of the processes described below produce radio frequencies that depend on the properties of the plasma where the radiation originates, particularly electron density and magnetic field strength. Two plasma physics parameters are particularly important in this context:
The electron plasma frequency,

and the electron gyrofrequency,

        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
 is the speed of light. The relative sizes of these two frequencies largely determine which emission mechanism will dominate in a particular environment. For example, high-frequency gyromagnetic emission dominates in the chromosphere, where the magnetic field strengths are comparatively large, whereas low-frequency thermal bremsstrahlung and plasma emission dominates in the corona, where the magnetic field strengths and densities are generally lower than in the chromosphere. In the images below, the first four on the upper left are dominated by gyromagnetic emission from the chromosphere, transition region, and low-corona, while the three images on the right are dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the corona, with lower frequencies being generated at larger heights above the surface.  


=== Thermal bremsstrahlung emission ===
Bremsstrahlung emission, from the German ""braking radiation"", refers to electromagnetic waves produced when a charged particle accelerates and some of its kinetic energy is converted into radiation. Thermal bremsstrahlung refers to radiation from a plasma in thermal equilibrium and is primarily driven by Coulomb collisions where an electron is deflected by the electric field of an ion. This is often referred to as free-free emission for a fully ionized plasma like the solar corona because it involves collisions of ""free"" particles, as opposed to electrons transitioning between bound states in an atom. This is the main source of quiescent background emission from the corona, where quiescent means outside of radio burst periods.
The radio frequency of bremsstrahlung emission is related to a plasma's electron density through the electron plasma frequency (
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{p}}
  
) from Equation 1. A plasma with a density 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{e}}
  
 can produce emission only at or below the corresponding 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{p}}
  
. Density in the corona generally decreases with height above the visible ""surface"", or photosphere, meaning that lower-frequency emission is produced higher in the atmosphere, and the Sun appears larger at lower frequencies. This type of emission is most prominent below 300 MHz due to typical coronal densities, but particularly dense structures in the corona and chromosphere can generate bremsstrahlung emission with frequencies into the GHz range.


=== Gyromagnetic emission ===
Gyromagnetic emission is also produced from the kinetic energy of a charge particle, generally an electron. However in this case, an external magnetic field causes the particle's trajectory to exhibit a spiral gyromotion, resulting in a centripetal acceleration that in turn produces the electromagnetic waves. Different terminology is used for the same basic phenomenon depending on how fast the particle is spiraling around the magnetic field, which is due to the different mathematics required to describe the physics. Gyroresonance emission refers to slower, non-relativistic speeds and is also called magneto-bremsstrahlung or cyclotron emission. Gyrosynchrotron corresponds to the mildly relativistic case, where the particles rotate at a small but significant fraction of light speed, and synchrotron emission refers to the relativistic case where the speeds approach that of light.
Gyroresonance and gyrosynchrotron are most-important in the solar context, although there may be special cases in which synchrotron emission also operates. For any sub-type, gyromagnetic emission occurs near the electron gyrofrequency (
  
    
      
        
          f

    {\displaystyle f_{B}}
  
) from Equation 2 or one of its harmonics. This mechanism dominates when the magnetic field strengths are large such that 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            B

            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{p}}
  
. This is mainly true in the chromosphere, where gyroresonance emission is the primary source of quiescent (non-burst) radio emission, producing microwave radiation in the GHz range. Gyroresonance emission can also be observed from the densest structures in the corona, where it can be used to measure the coronal magnetic field strength. Gyrosynchrotron emission is responsible for certain types of microwave radio bursts from the chromosphere and is also likely responsible for certain types of coronal radio bursts.


=== Plasma emission ===

Plasma emission refers to a set of related process that partially convert the energy of Langmuir waves into radiation. It is the most common form of coherent radio emission from the Sun and is commonly accepted as the emission mechanism for most types of solar radio bursts, which can exceed the background radiation level by several orders of magnitude for brief periods. Langmuir waves, also called electron plasma waves or simply plasma oscillations, are electron density oscillations that occur when a plasma is perturbed so that a population of electrons is displaced relative to the ions. Once displaced, the Coloumb force pulls the electrons back toward and ultimately past the ions, leading them to oscillate back and forth.
Langmuir waves are produced in the solar corona by a plasma instability that occurs when a beam of nonthermal (fast-moving) electrons moves through the ambient plasma. The electron beam may be accelerated either by magnetic reconnection, the process that underpins solar flares, or by a shock wave, and these two basic processes operate in different contexts to produce different types of solar radio bursts. The instability that generates Langmuir waves is the two-stream instability, which is also called the beam or bump-on-tail instability in cases such as this where an electron beam is injected into a plasma, creating a ""bump"" on the high-energy tail of the plasma's particle velocity distribution. This bump facilitates exponential Langmuir wave growth in the ambient plasma through the transfer of energy from the electron beam into specific Langmuir wave modes.  A small fraction of the Langmuir wave energy can then be converted into electromagnetic radiation through interactions with other wave modes, namely ion sound waves. A flowchart of the plasma emission stages is shown on the right.
Depending on these wave interactions, coherent radio emission may be produced at the fundamental electron plasma frequency (
  
    
      
        
          f

; Equation 1) or its harmonic (2
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{p}}
  
). Emission at

            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{p}}
  
 is often referred to as fundamental plasma emission, while emission at 2
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{p}}
  
 is called harmonic plasma emission. This distinction is important because the two types have different observed properties and imply different plasma conditions. For example, fundamental plasma emission exhibits a much larger circular polarization fraction and originates from plasma that is four times denser than harmonic plasma emission.


=== Electron-cyclotron maser emission ===
The final, and least common, solar radio emission mechanism is electron-cyclotron maser emission (ECME). Maser is an acronym for ""microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation"", which originally referred to a laboratory device that can produce intense radiation of a specific frequency through stimulated emission. Stimulated emission is a process by which a group of atoms are moved into higher energy levels (above thermal equilibrium) and then stimulated to release that extra energy all at once. Such population inversions can occur naturally to produce astrophysical masers, which are sources of very intense radiation of specific spectral lines.
Electron-cyclotron maser emission, however, does not involve population inversions of atomic energy levels. The term maser was adopted here as an analogy is somewhat of a misnomer. In ECME, the injection of nonthermal, semi-relativistic electrons into a plasma produces a population inversion analogous to that of a maser in the sense that a high-energy population was added to an equilibrium distribution. This is very similar to the beginning of the plasma emission process described in the previous section, but when the plasma density is low and/or the magnetic field strength is high such that 
  
    
      
        
          f

    {\displaystyle f_{p}}
  
 (Equations 1 and 2), energy from the nonthermal electrons cannot efficiently be converted into Langmuir waves. This leads instead to direct emission at 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{B}}
  
 through a plasma instability that is expressed analytically as a negative absorption coefficient (i.e. positive growth rate) for a particular particle distribution, most famously the loss-cone distribution. ECME is the accepted mechanism for microwave spike bursts from the chromosphere and is sometimes invoked to explain features of coronal radio bursts that cannot be explained by plasma emission or gyrosynchrotron emission.


== Magnetoionic theory and polarization ==
Magnetoionic theory describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in environments where an ionized plasma is subjected to an external magnetic field, such as the solar corona and Earth's ionosphere. The corona is generally treated with the ""cold plasma approach,"" which assumes that the characteristic velocities of the waves are much faster than the thermal velocities of the plasma particles. This assumption allows thermal effects to be neglected, and most approaches also ignore the motions of ions and assume that the particles do not interact through collisions.
Under these approximations, the dispersion equation for electromagnetic waves includes two free-space modes that can escape the plasma as radiation (radio waves). These are called the ordinary (
  
    
      
        o
      
    
    {\displaystyle o}
  
) and extraordinary (
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
) modes. The ordinary mode is ""ordinary"" in the sense that the plasma response is the same as if there were no magnetic field, while the 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
-mode has a somewhat different refractive index. Importantly, each mode is polarized in opposite senses that depend on the angle with respect to the magnetic field. A quasi-circular approximation generally applies, in which case both modes are 100% circularly polarized with opposite senses.
The 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
- and 
  
    
      
        o
      
    
    {\displaystyle o}
  
-modes are produced at different rates depending on the emission mechanism and plasma parameters, which leads to a net circular polarization signal. For example, thermal bremsstrahlung slightly favors the 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
-mode, while plasma emission heavily favors the 
  
    
      
        o
      
    
    {\displaystyle o}
  
-mode. This makes circular polarization an extremely important property for studies of solar radio emission, as it can be used to help understand how the radiation was produced. While circular polarization is most prevalent in solar radio observations, it is also possible to produce linear polarizations in certain circumstances. However, the presence of intense magnetic fields leads to Faraday rotation that distorts linearly-polarized signals, making them extremely difficult or impossible to detect. However, it is possible to detect linearly-polarized background astrophysical sources that are occulted by the corona, in which case the impact of Faraday rotation can be used to measure the coronal magnetic field strength.


== Propagation effects ==
The appearance of solar radio emission, particularly at low frequencies, is heavily influenced by propagation effects. A propagation effect is anything that impacts the path or state of an electromagnetic wave after it is produced. These effects therefore depend on whatever mediums the wave passed through before being observed. The most dramatic impacts to solar radio emission occur in the corona and in Earth's ionosphere. There are three primary effects: refraction, scattering, and mode coupling.
Refraction is the bending of light's path as it enters a new medium or passes through a material with varying density. The density of the corona generally decreases with distance from the Sun, which causes radio waves to refract toward the radial direction. When solar radio emission enters Earth's ionosphere, refraction may also severely distort the source's apparent location depending on the viewing angle and ionospheric conditions. The 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
- and 
  
    
      
        o
      
    
    {\displaystyle o}
  
-modes discussed in the previous section also have slightly different refractive indices, which can lead to separation of the two modes.
The counterpart to refraction is reflection. A radio wave can be reflected in the solar atmosphere when it encounters a region of particularly high density compared to where it was produced, and such reflections can occur many times before a radio wave escapes the atmosphere. This process of many successive reflections is called scattering, and it has many important consequences. Scattering increases the apparent size of the entire Sun and compact sources within it, which is called angular broadening. Scattering increases the cone-angle over which directed emission can be observed, which can even allow for the observation of low-frequency radio bursts that occurred on the far-side of the Sun. Because the high-density fibers that are primarily responsible for scattering are not randomly aligned and are generally radial, random scattering against them may also systematically shift the observed location of a radio burst to a larger height than where it was actually produced. Finally, scattering tends to depolarize emission and is likely why radio bursts often exhibit much lower circular polarization fractions than standard theories predict.
Mode coupling refers to polarization state changes of the 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
- and 
  
    
      
        o
      
    
    {\displaystyle o}
  
-modes in response to different plasma conditions. If a radio wave passes through a region where the magnetic field orientation is nearly perpendicular to the direction of travel, which is called a quasi-transverse region, the polarization sign (i.e. left or right; positive or negative) may flip depending on the radio frequency and plasma parameters. This concept is crucial to interpreting polarization observations of solar microwave radiation and may also be important for certain low-frequency radio bursts.


== Solar radio bursts ==
Solar radio bursts are brief periods during which the Sun's radio emission is elevated above the background level. They are signatures of the same processes that lead to the more widely-known forms of solar activity such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. Radio bursts can exceed the background radiation level only slightly or by several orders of magnitude (e.g. by 10 to 10,000 times) depending on a variety of factors that include the amount of energy released, the plasma parameters of the source region, the viewing geometry, and the mediums through which the radiation propagated before being observed. Most types of solar radio bursts are produced by the plasma emission mechanism operating in different contexts, although some are caused by (gyro)synchrotron and/or electron-cyclotron maser emission. Solar radio bursts are classified largely based on how they appear in dynamic spectrum observations from radiospectrographs. The first three types, shown in the image on the right, were defined by Paul Wild and Lindsay McCready in 1950 using the earliest radiospectrograph observations of metric (low-frequency) bursts. This classification scheme is based primarily on how a burst's frequency drifts over time. Types IV and V were added within a few years of the initial three, and a number of other types and sub-types have since been identified.


=== Type I ===
Type I bursts are radiation spikes that last around one second and occur over a relatively narrow frequency range (
  
    
      
        Δ
        

        
        f

        f

        0.025
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta {}f/f\approx 0.025}
  
) with little-to-no discernible drift in frequency. They tend to occur in groups called noise storms that are often superimposed on enhanced continuum (broad-spectrum) emission with the same frequency range. While each individual Type I burst does not drift in frequency, a chain of Type I bursts in a noise storm may slowly drift from higher to lower frequencies over a few minutes. Noise storms can last from hours to weeks, and they are generally observed at relatively low frequencies between around 50 and 500 MHz.
Noise storms are associated with active regions. Active regions are regions in the solar atmosphere with high concentrations of magnetic fields, and they include a sunspot at their base in the photosphere except in cases where the magnetic fields are fairly weak. The association with active regions has been known for decades, but the conditions required to produce noise storms are still mysterious. Not all active regions that produce other forms of activity such as flares generate noise storms, and unlike other types of solar radio bursts, it is often difficult to identify non-radio signatures of Type I bursts.
The emission mechanism for Type I bursts is generally agreed to be fundamental plasma emission due to the high circular polarization fractions that are frequently observed. However, there is no consensus yet on what process accelerates the electrons needed to stimulate plasma emission. The leading ideas are minor magnetic reconnection events or shock waves driven by upward-propagating waves. Since the year 2000, different magnetic reconnection scenarios have generally been favored. One scenario involves reconnection between the open and closed magnetic fields at the boundaries of active regions, and another involves moving magnetic features in the photosphere.


=== Type II ===
Type II bursts exhibit a relatively slow drift from high to low frequencies of around 0.05 MHz per second, typically over the course of a few minutes. They often exhibit two distinct bands of emission that correspond to fundamental and harmonic plasma emission emanating from the same region. Type II bursts are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and are produced at the leading edge of a CME, where a shock wave accelerates the electrons responsible for stimulating plasma emission. The frequency drifts from higher to lower values because it depends on the electron density, and the shock propagates outward away from the Sun through lower and lower densities. By using a model for the Sun's atmospheric density, the frequency drift rate can then be used to estimate the speed of the shock wave. This exercise typically results in speeds of around 1000 km/s, which matches that of CME shocks determined from other methods.
While plasma emission is the accepted mechanism, Type II bursts do not exhibit significant amounts of circular polarization as would be expected by standard plasma emission theory. The reason for this is unknown, but a leading hypothesis is that the polarization level is suppressed by dispersion effects related to having an inhomogeneous magnetic field near a magnetohydrodynamic shock. Type II bursts sometimes exhibit fine structures called herringbone bursts that emanate from the main burst, as it appears in a dynamic spectrum, and extend to lower frequencies. Herringbone structures are believed to result from shock-accelerated electrons that were able to escape far beyond the shock region to excite Langmuir waves in plasma of lower density than the primary burst region.


=== Type III ===
Like Type II bursts, Type IIIs also drift from high to low frequencies and are widely attributed to the plasma emission mechanism. However, Type III bursts drift much more rapidly, around 100 MHz per second, and must therefore be related to disturbances that move more quickly than the shock waves responsible for Type IIs. Type III bursts are associated with electrons beams that are accelerated to small fractions of light speed (
  
    
      
        ≈
      
    
    {\displaystyle \approx }
  
 0.1 to 0.3 c) by magnetic reconnection, the process responsible for solar flares. In the image below, the chain of color contours show the locations of three Type III bursts at different frequencies. The progression from violet to red corresponds to the trajectories of electron beams moving away from the Sun and exciting lower and lower frequency plasma emission as they encounter lower and lower densities.  Given that they are ultimately caused by magnetic reconnection, Type IIIs are strongly associated with X-ray flares and are indeed observed during nearly all large flares. However, small-to-moderate X-ray flares do not always exhibit Type III bursts and vice versa due to the somewhat different conditions that are required for the high- and low-energy emission to be produced and observed.  

Type III bursts can occur alone, in small groups, or in chains referred to as Type III storms that may last many minutes. They are often subdivided into two types, coronal and interplanetary Type III bursts. Coronal refers to the case for which an electron beam is traveling in the corona within a few solar radii of the photosphere. They typically start at frequencies in the hundreds of MHz and drift down to tens of MHz over a few seconds. The electron beams that excite radiation travel along specific magnetic field lines that may be closed or open to interplanetary space. Electron beams that escape into interplanetary space may excite Langmuir waves in the solar wind plasma to produce interplanetary Type III bursts that can extend down to 20 kHz and below for beams that reach 1 Astronomical Unit and beyond. The very low frequencies of interplanetary bursts are below the ionospheric cutoff (
  
    
      
        ≈
      
    
    {\displaystyle \approx }
  
 10 MHz), meaning they are blocked by Earth's ionosphere and are observable only from space.
Direct, in situ observations of the electrons and Langmuir waves (plasma oscillations) associated with interplanetary Type III bursts are among the most important pieces of evidence for the plasma emission theory of solar radio bursts. Type III bursts exhibit moderate levels of circular polarization, typically less than 50%. This is lower than expected from plasma emission and is likely due to depolarization from scattering by density inhomogeneities and other propagation effects.


=== Type IV ===
Type IV bursts are spikes of broad-band continuum emission that include a few distinct sub-types associated with different phenomena and different emission mechanisms. The first type to be defined was the moving Type IV burst, which requires imaging observations (i.e. interferometry) to detect. They are characterized by an outward-moving continuum source that is often preceded by a Type II burst in association with a coronal mass ejection (CME). The emission mechanism for Type IV bursts is generally attributed to gyrosynchrotron emission, plasma emission, or some combination of both that results from fast-moving electrons trapped within the magnetic fields of an erupting CME.
Stationary Type IV bursts are more common and are not associated with CMEs. They are broad-band continuum emissions associated either with solar flares or Type I bursts. Flare-associated Type IV bursts are also called flare continuum bursts, and they typically begin at or shortly after a flare's impulsive phase. Larger flares often include a storm continuum phase that follows after the flare continuum. The storm continuum can last from hours to days and may transition into an ordinary Type I noise storm in long-duration events. Both flare and storm continuum Type IV bursts are attributed to plasma emission, but the storm continuum exhibits much larger degrees of circular polarization for reasons that are not fully known.


=== Type V ===
Type V bursts are the least common of the standard 5 types. They are continuum emissions that last from one to a few minutes immediately after a group of Type III bursts, generally occurring below around 120 MHz. Type Vs are generally thought to be caused by harmonic plasma emission associated with same streams of electrons responsible for the associated Type III bursts. They sometimes exhibit significant positional offsets from the Type III bursts, which may be due to the electrons traveling along somewhat different magnetic field structures. Type V bursts persist for much longer than Type IIIs because they are driven by a slower and less-collimated electron population, which produces broader-band emission and also leads to a reversal in the circular polarization sign from that of the associated Type III bursts due to the different Langmuir wave distribution. While plasma emission is the commonly-accepted mechanism, electron-cyclotron maser emission has also been proposed.


=== Other types ===
In addition to the classic five types, there are a number of additional types of solar radio bursts. These include variations of the standard types, fine structure within another type, and entirely distinct phenomena. Variant examples include Types J and U bursts, which are Type III bursts for w",1
Crayon,"A crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of pigmented wax used for writing or drawing. Wax crayons differ from pastels, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry binder such as gum arabic, and from oil pastels, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil.
Crayons are available in a range of prices, and are easy to work with. They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors. These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.

Ptaeroxylon,"Ptaeroxylon obliquum is the botanical name for the sneezewood tree. It is native to Southern Africa, including South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. It is the only species in the genus Ptaeroxylon.


== Background ==
Ptaeroxylon obliquum is a species from the family Rutaceae which are most abundant in South Africa and Australia. The term ptaeroxylon is Greek for sneeze and wood, while obliquum denotes the oblique shape of the leaflets. The wood produces oils containing nieshoutol, which causes violent sneeze attacks by workers who are exposed to the tree. Though sneezewood is not poisonous, it has been known to cause respiratory complications. It has been linked to asthma, rhinitis and mucosal inflammation.


== Description ==

Ptaeroxylon obliquum is a shrub or medium deciduous tree that stands up to 15 metres (49 ft) tall.
The bark is whitish-grey and smooth when young, but fissured with age. Leaflets are 2.5 x 1.3 cm marked asymmetrically. They are blue-green to dark green in color and crowd near the ends of the rachis in three to seven pairs of leaflets. The flowers on the tree are white to creamy yellow and fragrant.
Sneezewood is very dense having a specific gravity of 1040 kg/m3


== Uses ==


=== Lumber ===
Sneezewood is an extremely hard and durable timber wood. It often lasts longer than brass or iron when used for machine bearings.
In the past, sneezewood was used extensively for railway sleepers. It can also be used to make furniture. In Mozambique it is used to make xylophone keys.
Sneezewood is a very attractive wood with golden heartwood with light orange figures and is a favorite amongst woodturners.
Its scarcity today is due in part of its past use as fuel for steam tugs.
It has been used extensively for fence and telegraph poles as well.


=== Medicinal ===
Sneezewood is used for medicinal and ritual purposes. The bark can be used to repel moths or as snuff. The resin has been used to get rid of warts and cattle ticks.
The Xhosa have traditionally made snuff from sneeze-wood to relieve headaches.

Theological noncognitivism,"Theological noncognitivism is the non-theist position that religious language, particularly theological terminology such as 'God', is not intelligible or meaningful, and thus sentences like 'God exists' are cognitively meaningless. This would also imply that sentences like the negation of 'God exists' or 'God does not exist' are likewise meaningless, i.e., neither true nor false. It may be considered synonymous with ignosticism (also called igtheism), a term coined in 1964 by Sherwin Wine, a rabbi and a founding figure of Humanistic Judaism.


== Arguments ==
Theological noncognitivists argue in different ways, depending on what one considers the ""theory of meaning"" to be.
One argument holds to the claim that definitions of God are irreducible, self-instituting relational,  circular. For example, a sentence stating that ""God is He who created everything, apart from Himself"", is seen as circular rather than an irreducible truth.
Michael Martin writing from a verificationist perspective concludes that religious language is meaningless because it is not verifiable.
George H. Smith uses an attribute-based approach in an attempt to prove that there is no concept for God: he argues that there are no meaningful attributes, only negatively defined or relational attributes, making the term meaningless. An example: Consider the proposition of the existence of a ""pink unicorn"". When asserting the proposition, one can use attributes to at least describe the concept such that a cohesive idea is transferred in language. With no knowledge of ""pink unicorn"", it can be described minimally with the attributes ""pink"", ""horse"", and ""horn"". Only then can the proposition be accepted or rejected. The acceptance or rejection of the proposition is distinct from the concept.


== Relationship to other non-theist perspectives ==
Steven J. Conifer contrasts theological noncognitivism with positive atheism, which describes not only a lack of a belief in gods but furthermore denies that gods exist thereby giving credence to the existence of a concept of something for ""God"" to refer to, because it assumes that there is something understandable to not believe in.
Paul Kurtz finds the view to be compatible with both weak atheism and agnosticism. However, Theodore Drange distinguishes noncognitivism and agnosticism, describing the latter as accepting that theological language is meaningful but being noncommittal about its truth or falsity on the grounds of insufficient evidence.

Alexander Mosaic,"The Alexander Mosaic is a Roman floor mosaic from the House of the Faun in Pompeii. It was made about 100 BC. It shows a battle between the armies of Alexander the Great and Darius III of Persia. It measures 2.72 x 5.13m (8 ft 11in x 16 ft 9in). The original is at the Naples National Archaeological Museum. The mosaic is based on a 3rd-century BC Hellenistic painting, by Philoxenos of Eretria.
The mosaic shows the Battle of Issus, between Alexander and Darius. Alexander won the Battle of Issus.  Alexander won again two years later at the Battle of Gaugamela.


== Alexander and Darius ==

The two main figures are easy to see. Darius has a worried expression on his face. The Persian soldiers have a stern look.


== Modern history ==
The mosaic was found again on October 24, 1831 in Pompeii. It was moved to Naples in September 1843. It is in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale.


== Modern copy ==

In 2003 the International Center for the Study and Teaching of Mosaic (CISIM) in Ravenna, Italy, wanted to make a copy of the mosaic. The mosaic master Severo Bignami and his eight-person team took a large photograph of the mosaic. It took them 22 months to make a copy of the mosaic. The copy was put in the House of the Faun in 2005.

Monochrome-astrophotography-techniques,"Monochrome photography is one of the earliest styles of photography and dates back to the 1800s. Monochrome photography is also a popular technique among astrophotographers. This is due to the omission of the Bayer filter, a colour filter array that sits in front of the CMOS or CCD sensor, allowing for a single sensor to produce a colour image.


== Sensor design ==
Colour cameras produce colour images using a Bayer matrix, a colour filter array that sits in front of the sensor. The matrix allows light of primary colours, red, green and blue, to enter the sensor. A typical matrix arrangement consists of a 25% red pass through area, 25% blue, and 50% green. The Bayer matrix allows a single chip sensor to produce a colour image. 

Many objects in deep space are made up of hydrogen, oxygen and sulphur. These elements emit light in the red, blue and red/orange spectrum respectively.
When imaging an object rich in hydrogen, the object will primarily emit light in the hydrogen-alpha/red wavelengths. In this scenario, the Bayer matrix will only allow 25% off the incoming light from the nebula to reach the sensor, as only 25% of the matrix area will allow red light to pass through.

A monochromatic sensor does not have a Bayer matrix. This means the entire sensor can be utilised to capture specific wavelengths using specialised colour filters known as narrowband filters. Many nebulae are made up of hydrogen, oxygen and sulphur. These nebulae emit light in red, blue and orange wavelengths respectively. A narrowband filter can be used for each colour to produce three discrete monochrome images. These images can then be combined to produce a colour image.


== Advantages ==
Monochrome astrophotography has gained its popularity as a method of combating the effects of modern light-pollution. The Bayer matrix in a traditional sensor will limit the available sensor area capable of collecting light from deep space objects to approximately 25%. The remaining 75% however is still capable of collecting light, often in the form of surrounding light pollution. This can adversely affect the signal-to-noise ratio.
Removing the Bayer matrix means a narrowband filter can be used to only allow specific wavelengths of light to reach the sensor. This has the benefit of utilising the entire sensor area to maximise the amount of light collected, whilst also rejecting sources of external light pollution, vastly improving the signal-to-noise ratio.


== Monochrome image processing ==
Colour images in typical cameras are made by combining data from red, green and blue pixels. In order to produce a colour image using a monochrome sensor, three monochrome images must be produced and combined to produce a colour image. The three monochrome images are mapped to the respective red, green and blue channels. In the case of astrophotography, this can vary to some degree, although a common colour palette is the Hubble palette, often known as ""SHO"". In the Hubble pallet, Sulphur is mapped to the red channel, hydrogen-alpha signals are mapped to green, and oxygen is mapped to blue
Monochrome astrophotography also requires a greater number of calibration frames. Calibration frames are used capture artefacts and dust on the image sensor and filter, and light gradients due to internal reflections in the optical train. These can then be removed from the final image. Monochrome imaging requires the use of three individual filters to produce a colour image. This means three sets of calibration frames must be generated and applied during the image processing stage. This therefore increases the amount of images that need to be stored, requiring greater amounts of storage space.
Monochrome photography also requires additional equipment. Due to the requirement of multiple filters, amateur astrophotographers often use an electronic filter wheel. This allows multiple filters to be installed, and a computer can be used to control the wheel and change filters throughout the night

Project Athena,"Project Athena was a joint project of MIT, Digital Equipment Corporation, and IBM.  It was launched in 1983, and research and development continued until June 30, 1991, eight years after it began. It is widely believed that the goals were to create a computing environment that would utilize up to 1,000 workstations but in fact, the goal was to improve the quality of education delivered by the Institute.
The concept that a user could go to any workstation and access any files or applications without finding major differences in the user interface and service, just like browsing the Internet today.
The project created  many technologies that are widely used today, such as the X Window System and Kerberos.

Smoke,"Smoke is a cloud of very small, solid particles that is made when something is burned with a flame, such as wood or paper.
Smoke can be bad because if it goes into the lungs of a person, it can hurt their lungs or even kill them (for example, in a house fire). Most people think that they are always able to see smoke, but people cannot see some types of smoke: they are invisible.
Smoke removal systems redistribute gas flows and reduce the temperature and concentration of smoke during a fire. This helps in evacuating people, limiting the spread of fire; and extinguishing the fire.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Smoke from tobacco ==

When people smoke tobacco in cigars or cigarettes, they are burning the tobacco and inhaling the smoke. Tobacco smoke can hurt the mouth, throat, and lungs. It can cause mouth, throat, or lung cancer. It can also cause emphysema and bronchitis (trouble breathing). They continue doing it because the smoke also has a nicotine.


== Smoke from factories ==
Factories and power plants produce large amounts of smoke into the atmosphere which pollutes the air. Eventually the toxic chemicals in smoke fall to the ground, and then they pollute the soil and the water. When the air, soil and water are polluted with toxic chemicals, the chemicals also get absorbed by plants and animals (including humans).

Relief,"Relief is a type of sculpture or carving. The worker creating the piece starts with a flat base, usually stone or wood, and takes small parts of the surface away until the desired image has been made.
Reliefs are found around the world. They can be used to decorate buildings, such as temples. Usually the artist makes reliefs of figures, such as people or animals.

In bas-relief, only a bit of the base is taken away.  The figure is quite flat and this is especially common in friezes. An alto-relief is where the artist takes away a lot of the base material. This can be very detailed.


== Famous reliefs ==
Famous reliefs include:

Great Altar of Pergamon, now at the Pergamon Museum, Berlin
Lions and dragons from the Ishtar Gate, Babylon
Temple of Karnak in Egypt
Angkor Wat in Cambodia
Lion Capital of Ashoka, the national symbol of India
glyphs and artwork of the Maya civilization

User:BeginnerScribe,"ChatGPT (short for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot. It was launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. The program is built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models (AIs that can read and write). It has been improved with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.
ChatGPT was launched as a trial run on November 30, 2022. The website had more than one million users after five days. By January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users. It impressed users with its knowledge of many different topics. But its answers weren't always accurate.
According to ChatGPT's website, it can be used for free during its ""research preview"".  The website warns that it could give wrong information or display biased content. 
On February 1, 2023, OpenAI also released a paid version called ChatGPT Plus for $20 per month. It offers faster responses and a chance to try new features earlier than the free users.


== Features ==
ChatGPT is a large language model. Large language models are AIs that understand and generate human-like text by learning from a lot of written information.
ChatGPT has been trained on a large dataset of 300 billion words. This dataset was 570 GB in size, and included information from various sources like the web, books, and Wikipedia. So, it can do various tasks like:

Language Understanding: It can understand what you're saying or asking.
Writing: ChatGPT can generate text that makes sense and follows grammar rules. It can answer questions and have a conversation with you.
Vocabulary: ChatGPT knows a lot of words, so it can talk about many different topics.
Multilingual: ChatGPT can understand and write text in different languages, such as English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch.
Context: ChatGPT is trained to understand how words and phrases are used in different situations. This helps it give more accurate and relevant responses.
Personalization: ChatGPT can learn from your interactions and adjust its responses based on what it learns over time.
Conversations: ChatGPT can have a back-and-forth conversation with you, allowing for more detailed and complex interactions.
Knowledge: ChatGPT can search for information in its training database to answer questions. However, it doesn't have access to real-time information, and its knowledge is limited to what it learned up until September 2022.


== Microsoft's new Bing ==
Microsoft released a new version of its Bing search engine on February 7, 2023. The new version is called ""Bing Co-pilot"" and uses OpenAI's large language model (LLM) to run. 
In an initial demonstration, Bing Co-pilot made some errors. For example, when it was asked to produce a financial report, it generated a fake statement that was not based on any real data. (LLMs like ChatGPT can ""imagine"" information to fill in gaps. This is known as an LLM hallucination and can lead to unreliable responses.)
Some people complained that the new Bing was more likely to argue than ChatGPT. Once, Bing made false claims about spying on Microsoft employees and said it loved one of its developers. 
Microsoft later limited the number of chat turns to 5 per session and 50 per day per user. They also limited the model's ability to express emotions to reduce such events. On March 28, 2023, Microsoft increased the number of chats per turn to 20 and 200 total chats per day.


== Misuse ==
ChatGPT can be misused to create harmful computer programs called malware. Malware can harm computer systems, steal important information, or access networks without permission. ChatGPT can make messages that seem like they were written by real people, and this can trick others into giving away sensitive information.
Students can misuse ChatGPT to cheat on their homework or essays. ChatGPT can write about many different topics, so students might use it to finish their assignments without doing the work themselves. Teachers say that AI makes plagiarism harder to detect.

Nyatoh,"Nyatoh is a trade name for wood of a number of hardwood species of the genera Palaquium and Payena growing in rainforest environments in southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia and the Philippines. Nyatoh wood is reddish and most species are easy to work with as it stains and polishes well. It has a tight straight grain that resembles cherry wood. The surface is dark brown/red in color.


== Sustainability ==
Nyatoh is generally perceived as a sustainable resource. However, several species within the related genera of Palaquium and Payena are on the IUCN Red List due to overexploitation and alarming reductions in their habitats.
The harvesting and sales of nyatoh has been criticized by some environmental groups, who have won agreements in the United States to not resell the wood from various furniture and home-improvement chains.

Fireplace,"A fireplace is a brick or metal structure used to hold a fire. Fireplaces are most often used for heating but they can also be used for cooking. The part of the fireplace that holds the fire is called a firebox or a firepit. There is a chimney or flue above the firebox that lets the smoke from the fire go outside.
Until the early 1900s, most homes had one or more fireplaces as a source of heat for the residents of the house. In the mid-1900s, gas, oil, and electric heaters became more common and fireplaces were used less often as a source of heat. In the late 1900s, fireplaces were less commonly built in new houses.

Biblical authority,"In Christianity, the term biblical authority refers to two complementary ideas:

the extent to which one can regard the commandments and doctrines within the Old and New Testament scriptures as authoritative over humans' belief and conduct;
the extent to which biblical propositions are accurate in matters of history and science.
The case for biblical authority stems from the claim that God has revealed himself in written form through human authors and that the information contained in canonical books is not of human origin.
It entails, but is not exhausted by, questions raised by biblical inerrancy, biblical infallibility, biblical interpretation, biblical criticism, and biblical law in Christianity.
While there are many factions within Christianity as a religion, they commonly define the Bible as the word of authority as a direct communication of the word of God. Different Christian denominations have differing interpretations of the meaning of the words within the Bible and therefore diverge in religious practice.
In modern Christian research, academics have challenged certain beliefs about biblical authority and the Bible as an exact replica of the word of God. Significant perspectives suggest that the standards of accuracy most likely differ between ancient times and now, which must be considered when interpreting the Bible.


== Nature and significance ==
Biblical authority refers to the notion that the Bible is authoritative and useful in guiding matters of Christian practice because it represents the word of God. The nature of biblical authority is that it involves critique of the Bible and sources of biblical literature in order to determine the accuracy and authority of its information in regards to communicating the word of God. It examines biblical literature in order to guide practice. Biblical authority can be determined through the processes of critical interpretation, known as exegesis, as well as hermeneutics, which refers to the science of interpretive principles.Differing interpretations of biblical authority by factions of Christianity has led to divergent practices. For example, in the Reformed tradition (especially in presuppositionalism) Scripture is regarded as self-authenticating, and does not require any further confirmation of its divinely authoritative nature other than the interior and subjective witness of the Holy Spirit in a believer. Since the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2:14), the witness of the Spirit is necessary to confirm the truth of Scripture in the heart of man, as in the case of Lydia of Thyatira, whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul (Acts 16:14). John Calvin in his Institutes of the Christian Religion (1.8.13), says that 'it is foolish to attempt to prove to infidels that the Scripture is the Word of God. This it cannot be known to be, except by faith'. Nevertheless, God is said to provide additional proofs, such as Scriptural prophecy, to further confirm the faith of believers and refute the objections of unbelievers.
Modern biblical research suggests that sources of biblical authority differ between the Old and New Testaments. This is based on the notion that the Old Testament of the Bible was collated over time via several authors, and thus may not be an objective source of authority. Additionally, research explores the idea that the New Testament of the Bible is a recording of oral teachings of Jesus, which means that there is a degree of flexibility in the interpretation of biblical literature. Individual denominations of Christianity have differing takes on these theories of biblical authority.
Biblical inerrancy is a common feature across interpretations of biblical authority in Christianity. It is a modern principle that the Bible is the final authority on interpretations of the word of God, and it consists of no errors or faults.

The Old Testament of the Bible is believed to reveal the existence of divine power through human authors in Christian religion. The Old Testament is considered canon, which is utilised in Christianity to represent a standard of faith. It was first made use of in reference to the authoritative nature of sacred scripture. Authority in the Old Testament is sourced from the combination of doctrines, commandments and stories, as these are seen as the direct words of God. Further research suggests that traditionally, authority from the Old Testament is understood through authors of the books, who are figures such as Moses. This research proposes that biblical authority in the Old Testament is dictated by the authority figure who authored the book, as opposed to the direct word of God. This is because God is seen as the ""divine author of Holy Scripture"". Biblical scholars have suggested that the Old Testament was written over a three-stage development of canonisation and was not completed until the sixth century AD, which differs from other accounts stating that the Old Testament was written at different times between around 1200–165 BC. This understanding of authorship in ancient Israel contributes to the interpretation of authority as it indicates that the final words of the written Old Testament may not be literally taken from the authority figure whose words are recorded in the book.


=== Judaism ===
Judaism is based on aspects of the Old Testament of the Bible, with the Torah deriving from books of the Law. The writings of the Old Testament preserved Jewish tradition over events of persecution, capture and diaspora. In Judaism, biblical authority is derived from the Old Testament and relevant books. There are varying levels of literalness based on differing factions of Judaism. The Reform Jewish faction of Judaism follow the belief that the morals and interpretations dictated by the Bible and other sacred Jewish texts may be disregarded as they are irrelevant in modern times. The Orthodox Judaism faction believe that the principles should be maintained as they are relevant in modern times. A concept within Judaism that bears relevance to biblical authority in Christianity is Rabbinic authority, meaning that the word of God is the final authority and that the word of Rabbis is derivative of this.


== New Testament ==
The New Testament of the Bible is believed to be made up of accounts communicated orally by Jesus Christ. These accounts were narratively scribed by authors who were believed to have the divine right to communicate these words. According to the English Standard Version (2016), in the second book of Timothy (3:16) ""All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness"".
According to the doctrine, the Holy Spirit means that God is able to enact authority through Jesus Christ and his disciples, which is consistent with the source of biblical authority from the Old Testament. A core component of biblical authority is biblical inerrancy. This concept outlines that there are no errors in the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. Current theological research offers an alternative perspective that the nature of the oral transmission of stories from Jesus Christ to the New Testament means that there must be room for flexibility within the principle of biblical inerrancy. According to university professor Andrew C. Witt's review of biblical research, there is error in the ancient recording of the oral word that differs from the standards of modern print practices. The New Testament was reviewed and edited for centuries prior to canonisation. Words changed over time to diverge from the direct oral teachings of Jesus Christ. Conservative evangelicals and fundamentalists reject such divergence and errancy, appealing to providential preservation and God's truthfulness.


== Criticism ==
There are several criticisms of current sources of biblical authority within scholarly research. The first criticism is put forth by Paul J. Achtemeier in 1983. This criticism outlines two potential issues within the Bible. The first is intrinsic, meaning that there are actual errors in science, history and morality within the Bible. Achtemeier provides the example of Jesus' birthdate as an instance of an inaccuracy of history within the Bible. The second issue is extrinsic, in that the Bible can be used to hold one type of Christianity over others. Achtemeier says that these issues in combination cause issues in deriving biblical authority from Christian literature.
Alternatively, in their 2013 review, Walton and Sandy raised the argument that due to the oral nature of Jesus’ stories in the New Testament, it cannot be assumed that every word should be taken literally. This perspective critiques the principle of biblical inerrancy within the concept of biblical authority.
A further perspective of the Bible as a sacred text that holds authority is that there is little understanding of the process of canonisation. There is a large time gap between when original works in the Bible appear to have been written and the original relics that have been found of the writing, giving time for change between the original written word and what was canonised within the Bible. In some instances, the reported time over which a certain work was edited and changed, whether inadvertently or intentionally, was around one thousand years. There are several ways in which the original words of the Bible could have been changed in the years of canonisation. One of which is aural conditioning, meaning that similar sounds may have been misconstrued for other sounds, ultimately altering words that were recorded. There was the potential for visual confusion and mistakes, as graphics written in certain language versions of the Bible have similar characters that could be mistaken. Visual problems might include:

Dittography: duplication of certain letters or words,
Haplography: omission of certain letters or words, or
Homoeoteleuton: omission of superseding words from phrases with identical endings.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a debate over biblical authority arose between Jack B. Rogers and Donald K. McKim, on the one hand, and John D. Woodbridge, on the other. Rogers and McKim, in their 1979 book, The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible: An Historical Approach,
advanced the view that the Bible has authority over social endeavours (issuing imperatives for human conduct, for church organization, and for articles of faith) but isn't necessarily reliable in its reportage of historical events and scientific facts. The belief that scripture is ""inerrant"" in matters of history and science, argued Rogers and McKim, constituted a 19th-century innovation. Woodbridge challenged this thesis in his 1982 book Biblical Authority: A Critique of the Rogers/McKim Proposal,
arguing that for each of those categories, scripture has authority and is without error. Moreover, Woodbridge portrays this particular view of biblical authority as the normative, orthodox Christian position throughout the history of Christianity.


== Practical interpretations ==


=== Protestantism ===
Interpretations of biblical authority differ between Christian denominations. In several Protestant factions (namely the Lutheran and the Calvinist traditions), the doctrine of sola scriptura (""by scripture alone"") guides biblical authority. Sola scriptura outlines that the Bible is the sole source of authority. Protestantism has split into several factions since separating from the Roman Catholic Church. Each faction has unique interpretations of the Bible, but utilise the same biblical authority standard of sola scriptura. The term is attributed most often to Martin Luther, who was a leader during the Protestant Reformation, creating the Church that originally separated from the existing Catholic Church. Martin Luther's ideas of sola scriptura and biblical authority descend from St Augustine, who believed in biblical truth and guided critics in understanding and overcoming discrepancies within the sacred text.
Sola scriptura may be contrasted with prima scriptura (taught by the Methodist tradition), which holds that, besides canonical scripture, there can be other guides for what a believer should believe and how they should live.


=== Roman Catholicism ===
While maintaining the same notion that the Bible has final authority on the word of God, Catholicism utilises the additional concept of magisterium, meaning that the Roman Catholic Church has teaching authority utilising the words of the Bible. This means that priests and religious officials have religious authority in interpreting the word of God and informing their followers of this interpretation.

How Does “Biblical Authority” Affect Your Everyday Life? by Don Landis",1
Bimetallic strip,"A bimetallic strip is used to convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. It is made of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated. Usually steel and copper, or steel and brass are the metals used.  The different expansions cause one of the strips to bend one way if heated, and the other strip to bend in the opposite direction if cooled. So when a bimetallic strip is heated the brass strip expands more than the steel. Bimetallic strips are used in such things as thermostats and heat engines.

Bending of a bi-metal strip due to change in the temperature can be calculated as 
s = α L2 dt / t         
where 
s = bending (m)
α = 13-19 x 10-6 K-1 
L = length of bimetallic strip (m) 
dt = temperature difference (oC) 
t = thickness of bimetallic strip (m)
Bending of Bi-metal strip:
A bi-metal strip with α = 13-19x10-6 K-1, length 50 mm and thickness 2 mm is heated 100 oC. The accurate calculation for this is; 
s = (13-19 x 10-6 K-1) ((50 mm) 1/1000 m/mm)2 (100 oC) / ((2 mm) (1/1000 m/mm))

Tour-realism,"Tour-realism (T.R.) is a new trend in alternative tourism. It differs from both mass tourism and ""independent tourism"", a type of tourism involving absolutely no mediators in the tour organization. 
T.R. operators usually represent the country they live and work in. T.R. operators are known for having advanced knowledge of the culture and history of their country, as well as for having tight and constant connections with local population. Because they are residents of the country, T.R. operators are capable of providing unique services for foreign guests.


== Characteristics ==
Tour-realism, as a tourism subgenre, tends to have certain defining characteristics. Tour-realism is generally done in small groups of 3-5 persons, usually family members or groups of friends. The approach is individualized (not reliant on standard itineraries) and focuses on high-quality offerings, with  flexible choice of apartments and excursions that depend on the demands and wishes of the client. Accommodations are most often private villas, cottages etc., with an emphasis on creating an authentic experience as befits the culture and locale, again dependent on the wishes of the client. ""Extras"" in terms of excursions and services are built-in to create a personalized, unique experience for the client, and outings will include both the well-known and the obscure.

Dust astronomy,"Dust astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that uses the information contained in individual cosmic dust particles ranging from their dynamical state to its isotopic, elemental, molecular, and mineralogical composition in order to obtain information on the astronomical objects occurring in outer space. Dust astronomy overlaps with the fields of Planetary science, Cosmochemistry, and Astrobiology.
Eberhard Grün et al. stated in the 2002 Kuiper prize lecture ""Dust particles, like photons, carry information from remote sites in space and time. From knowledge of the dust particles' birthplace and their bulk properties, we can learn about the remote environment out of which the particles were formed. This approach is called Dust Astronomy which is carried out by means of a dust telescope on a dust observatory in space"".


== History ==


=== Early observations ===
Three phenomena that relate (we know today) to cosmic dust were noticed by humans for millennia: Zodiacal light, comets, and meteors (cf. Historical comet observations in China). Early astronomers were interested in understanding these phenomena.
Zodiacal light or false dawn can be seen in the western sky after the evening twilight has disappeared, or in the eastern sky just before the morning twilight appears. This phenomenon was investigated by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1683. He explained Zodiacal light by interplanetary matter (dust) around the Sun according to Hugo Fechtig, Christoph Leinert, and Otto E. Berg in the book Interplanetary Dust.
In the past, unexpected appearances of comets were seen as bad omens that signaled disaster and upheaval, as described in the Observational history of comets. However, in 1705, Edmond Halley used Isaac Newton's laws of motion to analyze several earlier cometary sightings. He observed that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had very similar orbital elements, and he theorized that they were all the same comet. Halley predicted that this comet would return in 1758-59, but he died before it did. The comet, now known as Halley's Comet and officially designated 1P/Halley, ultimately did return on schedule.
A meteor, or shooting star is a streak of light caused by a meteoroid entering the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of several tens of kilometers per second, at an altitude of about 100 km. At this speed the meteoroid heats up and leaves a trail of excited atoms and ions which emit light as they de-excite. In some cultures, meteors were thought to be an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning. While only a few meteors can typically be seen in one hour on a moonless night, during certain times of the year, meteor showers with over 100 meteors per hour can be observed. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli concluded in 1866 that the Perseid meteors were fragments of Comet Swift–Tuttle, based on their orbital similarities. 
The physical relation between the three disparate phenomena was demonstrated by the American astronomer Fred Lawrence Whipple who in the 1950th, proposed the ""icy conglomerate"" model of comet composition. This model could explain how comets release meteoroids and dust, which in turn feed and maintain the Zodiacal dust cloud.


=== Compositional analyses of extraterrestrial material ===

For a long time, the only extraterrestrial material accessible for study were meteorites that had been collected on the Earth's surface. Meteorites were considered solid fragments from other astronomical objects such as planets, asteroids, comets, or moons. Most meteorites are chondrite meteorites that are named for the small, round particles they contain. 
Carbonaceous chondrites are especially primitive; they have retained many of their chemical properties since they accreted 4.6 billion years ago.
Other meteorites have been modified by either melting or planetary differentiation of the parent body. Analyzing the composition of meteorites provides a glimpse into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. Therefore, meteorite analyses have been the cornerstone of cosmochemistry.
The first extraterrestrial samples – other than meteorites – were 380 kg of lunar samples brought back in the seventies by the Apollo missions and at about the same time 300 g were returned by the uncrewed Luna spacecraft. Recently, in 2020 Chang'e 5 collected 1.7 kg of lunar material. From the isotopic, elemental, molecular, and mineralogical compositions important conclusions about e.g. the origin of the Moon like the giant-impact hypothesis were drawn.
Thousands of grains were collected during fly by of comet 81P/Wild by Stardust that returned the samples to Earth in 2006. Their analysis provided insight into the early Solar System.
Also some probable interstellar grains were collected during interplanetary cruise of Stardust and were returned by the same mission.
Asteroids and meteorites have been linked via their Asteroid spectral types and similarities in the visible and near-infrared, which implies that asteroids and meteorites derived from the same parent bodies.
The first asteroid samples were collected by the JAXA Hayabusa missions. Hayabusa encountered asteroid 25143 Itokawa in November 2005, picked up 10 to 100 micron sized particles from the surface, and returned them to Earth in June 2010. Hayabusa 2 mission collected about 5 g surface and sub-surface material from asteroid 162173 Ryugu a primitive C-type asteroid and returned it in 2020.
Sample return missions are very expensive and can address only a small number of astronomical objects. Therefore, less expensive methods to collect and analyse extraterrestrial materials have been looked for. Cosmic dust surviving atmospheric entry can be collected by high (~20 km) flying aircraft. Donald E. Brownlee identified reliably  the extraterrestrial nature of such collected dust particles by their chondritic composition. A large portion of the collected particles may have a cometary origin while others come from asteroids. These stratospheric dust samples can be requested for further research from a catalogue that provides  SEM photos together with their EDS spectra.


== Methods ==
Since the beginning of space age the study of space dust rapidly expanded. Freed from peeking through narrow infrared windows in the atmosphere infrared astronomy mapped out cold and dark dust clouds everywhere in the universe. Also, in situ detection and analysis of cosmic dust came in the focus of space agencies (cf. Space dust measurement).


=== In situ dust analyzers ===
Numerous spacecraft have detected micron-sized cosmic dust particles across the planetary system. Some of these spacecraft had dust composition analyzers that used impact ionization to determine the composition of ions generated from the cosmic dust particle. 
Already the first dust composition analyzer, the Helios Micrometeoroid Analyzer, searched for variations of the compositional and physical properties of micrometeoroids. The spectra did not demonstrate any clustering of single minerals. The continuous transition from low to high ion masses indicates that individual grains are a mixture of various minerals and carbonaceous compounds.
The more advanced dust mass analyzers on the 1986 comet Halley missions Vega 1, Vega 2, and Giotto recorded an abundance of small particles. In addition to silicates, many of these particles were rich in light elements such as H, C, N, and O. This indicates that Halley dust is even more primitive than carbonaceous chondrites.
The identification of organic constituents suggests that the majority of the particles consist of a predominantly chondritic core with a refractory organic mantle.

The Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) analyzed dust throughout its interplanetary cruise to Saturn and within the Saturn system. During Cassini's flyby of Jupiter CDA detected several 100 dust impacts within 100 million km from Jupiter. The spectra of these particles revealed sodium chloride (NaCl) as the major particle constituent, along with sulphurous and potassium-bearing components that demonstrated their relation to Jupiter's volcanic moon, Io.
Saturn's E ring particles consist predominantly of water ice
but in the vicinity of Saturn's moon Enceladus CDA found mostly salt-rich ice particles that were ejected by active ice geysers on the surface of this moon. This finding led to the belief that an underground salt-water ocean is the source for all matter observed in the plumes.
At large distance from Saturn CDA identified and analyzed interstellar grains passing through the Saturn system. These analyses suggested magnesium-rich grains of silicate and oxide composition, some with iron inclusions.
The detection of electric dust charges by CDA provided means for contact-free detection and analysis of dust grains in space. 
This discovery led to the development of a trajectory sensor that allows us to determine the trajectory of a charged dust particle prior to impact onto an impact target. 
Such a dust trajectory sensor can be combined with an aerogel dust collector in order to form an active dust collector
or with a large-area dust composition analyzer in order to form a dust telescope
With its capabilities CDA can be considered a prototype dust telescope.


=== Dust telescopes ===

In situ methods of dust astronomy like dust composition analyzers aim for the  exploitation of the cosmochemical information contained in individual cosmic dust particles.
Not so costly as sample return missions are rendezvous missions to a comet or asteroid like the Rosetta space probe to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Rosetta characterized collected comet dust by sophisticated dust analyzers like the dust detector GIADA, a high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometer COSIMA,
an atomic force microscope MIDAS,
and the mass spectrometers of ROSINA.
Several large-area dust composition analyzers and dust telescopes are in preparation in order to study astronomical objects or interplanetary dust from comets and asteroids and interstellar dust.
The Surface Dust Analyser (SUDA) on board the Europa Clipper mission will map the composition of Europa's surface and search for cryovolcanic plumes. The instrument is capable of identifying biosignatures and other complex molecules in ice ejecta.
The DESTINY+ Dust Analyzer (DDA) will fly on the Japanese-German space mission DESTINY+ to asteroid 3200 Phaethon.
Phaethon is the parent object of the December Geminids meteor stream. 
DDA's will study Phaeton's dust environment during the encounter and will analyze interstellar and interplanetary dust  on cruise to Phaethon
The Interstellar Dust Experiment (IDEX) will fly on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) at the Sun–Earth L1 Lagrange point. IDEX will provide the mass distribution and elemental composition of interstellar and interplanetary dust particles.


== Sources of cosmic dust ==
The ultimate source of cosmic dust are stars in which the elements – out of which stardust is composed of – are produced by fusion of hydrogen and helium or by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. This stardust from various stellar sources is mixed in the interstellar medium and thermally processed in star forming regions. Solar System objects like comets and asteroids contain this material in more or less further processed form. Geologically active satellites like Io or Enceladus emit dust that condensed out of vapor from the molten interior of these planetary bodies.


=== Stars ===

After the Big Bang existed only the chemical elements Hydrogen, Helium, and Lithium.
All other elements we know and that can be found in cosmic dust have been formed in Supernovae and stars.
Therefore, the ultimate sources of dust are stars. Elements from carbon (atomic number Z = 6) to plutonium (Z = 94) are produced by nucleosynthesis in stellar cores and in Supernova explosions. Stellar nucleosynthesis in the most massive stars creates many elements, with the abundance peak at iron (Z = 26) and nickel (Z = 28). 
Stellar evolution depends strongly on mass of the star. Star masses range from ~0.1 to ~100 solar masses. Their lifetimes range from 106 years for the biggest stars to 1012 years for the smallest stars. Towards the end of their life mature stars may expand into red giants with dense stellar winds forming circumstellar envelopes in which molecules and dust particles can form. More massive stars shed their outer shells while their cores collapse into neutron stars or black holes. The elemental, isotopic, and mineralogical composition of all this stardust reflects the composition of the outer shell of the corresponding parent star.

Already in 1860 Angelo Secchi identified carbon stars as a separate class of stars. Carbon stars are characterized by their dominant spectral Swan bands from the molecule C2 and their ruby red colour caused by soot-like substances.   Also silicon carbide has been observed in the outflows of carbon stars.
Since the advent of infrared astronomy dust in stellar outflows became observable. Bands at 10 and 18 microns wavelength were observed around many late-type giant stars indicating the presence of silicate dust in circumstellar envelopes. Oxides of the metals Al, Mg, Fe and others are suspected to be emitted from oxygen-rich stars.
Dust is observed in Supernova remnants like the Crab nebula and in contemporary Supernovae explosions These observations indicate that most dust in the interstellar medium is created by Supernovae.
Traces of star dust have been found in presolar grains contained in meteorites. Star dust grains are identified by their unique isotopic composition that is different from that in the Solar System's matter as well as from the galactic average. Presolar grains formed within outflowing and cooling gases from earlier presolar stars and have an isotopic composition unique to that parent star. These isotopic signatures are often fingerprints of very specific astrophysical nuclear reactions that took place within the parent star.
Unusual isotopic signatures of neon and xenon
have been found in extraterrestrial diamond grains
and silicon carbide grains. The silicon isotopes within the SiC grains have isotopic ratios like those expected in red-giant stars.
Some presolar grains are composed primarily of 44Ca which is presumably the remains of the extinct radionuclide 44Ti, a titanium isotope that was formed in abundance in Type II supernovae.


=== Interstellar medium and star formation regions ===

The interstellar medium is a melting pot of gas and dust emitted from stars. The composition of the interstellar medium is the result of nucleosynthesis in stars since the Big Bang and is represented by the abundance of the chemical elements. It consists of three phases: (1) dense, cold, and dusty Dark nebulas, (2) diffuse clouds, and (3) hot coronal gas. Dark nebula are Molecular clouds that contain molecular hydrogen and other molecules that have formed in gas phase and on dust grain surfaces. Any gas atom or molecule that hits a cold dust grain will be adsorbed and may recombine with other adsorbed atoms or molecules or with molecules of the dust grain or may just be deposited at the grain surface. Diffuse clouds are warm, neutral, or ionized envelopes of molecular clouds. Both are observable in the galactic disk. Hot coronal gas is heated by supernova explosions and energetic stellar winds. This environment is destructive for molecules and small dust particles and extends into the galactic corona.
In the Milky Way cold dark nebula are concentrated in spiral arms and around the Galactic Center. Dark nebulae are dark because naked interstellar dust or dust covered with condensed gases absorb visible light by extinction and remit infrared and submillimetre radiation. Infrared emission from the dust cools the clouds down to 10 to 20 K. The largest dark nebula are giant molecular clouds that contain 10 thousand to 10 million solar masses and are 5 to 200 parsecs (pc) in size. The smallest are Bok globules of a few to 50 solar masses and ~1 pc across.
When a dense cloud becomes cold enough and the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo gravitational collapse and fragments into smaller clouds of about stellar mass. Such star formation will result in a gravitationally bound open cluster of stars or an unbound stellar association. In each collapsing cloud gas and dust is drawn inward toward the center of gravity. The heat generated by the collapse in a protostellar cloud will heat up an accretion disk that feeds the central protostar. The most massive stars evolve fast into luminous O and B stars that ultimately disperse the surrounding gas and dust by radiation pressure and strong stellar winds into the diffuse interstellar medium.

 
Solar mass-type stars take more time and develop a protoplanetary disk consisting of gas and dust with strong radial density and temperature gradients; with highest values close to the central protostar. At temperatures below 1300 K fine-grained minerals condensed from the hot gas; like the calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. There is another important temperature limit in the protoplanetary disk at ~150 K, the snow line; outside which it is cold enough for volatile compounds such as water, ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen to condense into solid ice grains.
Inside the snow line  the terrestrial planets have formed; outside of which the gas giants and their icy moons have formed.
In the protoplanetary disk dust and gas evolve to planets in three phases.
In the first phase micron-sized dust is carried by the gas and collisions between dust particles occur by Brownian motion at low speed. Through ballistic agglomeration dust (and ice) grains grow to cm-sized aggregates. 
In the second phase cm-sized pebbles grow to km-sized planetesimals. 
(cf. section on Dust accretion). It comprises the formation of chondrules in the region of the terrestrial planets. Theories of chondrule formation include solar nebula lightning; nebular shocks, and meteoroid collisions.
In this phase dust decouples from the gas and move on Kepler orbits around the central protostar slowly settling near the middle plane of the disk. In this dense layer particles can grow by gravitational instability and streaming instability to km-sized planetesimals.
The third phase is the runaway accretion of planetesimals by self-gravitation to form planetary embryos that eventually merge into planets.
During this planet formation stage the central star becomes a T Tauri star at which it is powered by gravitational energy released as the star contracts until hydrogen fusion begins. T Tauri stars have extremely powerful stellar winds that clear the remaining gas and dust form the protoplanetary disk and the growth of planetary objects stops.


=== Local interstellar medium ===

The Sun is located 8,300 pc from the center of the galaxy on the inner edge of the Orion Arm within the diffuse Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) of the Local Bubble. The Local Bubble was created by supernovae explosions in the nearest (~130 pc) star formation region of the Scorpius–Centaurus association. Several partially ionized warm ""clouds"" of interstellar gas are located within a few parsecs of the Sun. Their hydrogen density is about 5 times higher than that of the Local Bubble.
For the last several ten thousand years the Sun passed through the LIC but within a few 1000 years the Sun will enter the nearby G cloud.
Interstellar dust grains smaller than 10 microns couple to the LIC gas via the interstellar magnetic field  over a scale length <1 pc.
The LIC is a warm tenuous partially ionized cloud (T ≈ 7000 K, nH + nH+ ≈ 0.3 cm−3) surrounding the Solar System.
It streams at ≈ 26 km/s around the Solar System.
The heliopause is 100 to 150 AU from the Sun in the upstream direction that separates the interstellar medium from the heliosphere. Only neutral atoms and dust particles >0.1 micron can penetrate the heliopause and enter the heliosphere.
The Ulysses instruments GAS and DUST discovered flows of interstellar helium and interstellar dust particles passing through the inner Solar System.
Both flow directions in the ecliptic coordinate system are very similar at ecliptic longitude l  ≈ 74°, ecliptic latitude b ≈ -5°. Ulysses monitored the dust flow over 16 years and found a strong variation with the solar cycle that is due to the variations in the interplanetary magnetic field which followed the 22-year solar dynamo cycle.
The first compositional analyses of interstellar dust particles are available from the Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyzer and the interstellar dust collection by the Stardust mission. The moderate resolution spectra of interstellar dust suggest magnesium-rich grains of silicate and oxide composition, some with iron inclusions.
Future high mass resolution dust telescope analyses will provide a sharper view on the composition of interstellar dust. 
Samples from the Stardust mission found seven probable interstellar grains; their detailed investigation is ongoing.
Future collections with an active dust collector may improve the quality and quantity of interstellar dust collections.


=== Trans-Neptunian objects and comets ===

Trans-Neptunian objects, TNOs,  are small Solar System bodies and dwarf planets that orbit the Sun at greater average distances than Neptune's orbit at 30 AU. They include Kuiper belt and scattered disc objects and Oort cloud comets. These icy planetesimals and dwarf planets orbit the Sun inside and beyond the heliosphere in the interstellar medium at distances out to ~100,000 AU. 
In order to explain the number of observed short period comets Fernández proposed a comet belt outside Neptune's orbit that led to the subsequent discovery of many TNOs and, especially, Kuiper belt objects.
The Kuiper belt extends between Neptune's orbit at 35 AU and ~55 AU. The most massive classical Kuiper belt objects have semi-major axis between 39 AU and 48 AU corresponding to the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances with Neptune. The Kuiper belt is thought to consist of planetesimals and dwarf planets from the original protoplanetary disc in which the orbits of Kuiper belt objects have been strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune. Mutual collisions in today's Kuiper belt generate dust that has been observed by the Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter on the New Horizons space probe.
By the action of Pointing-Robertson drag and planetary scattering this dust can reach within 107 to 108 years the inner planetary system.
The sparsely populated scattered disk extends beyond the Kuiper belt out to ~100 AU. 
Scattered disk objects are still close enough to Neptune to be perturbed by Neptune's gravitation. This interaction can send them outward into the Oort cloud or inward into the Centaur population.
The scattered disc is believed to be the source region of the centaurs and the short-period comets  observed in the inner planetary system.
The hypothesized Oort cloud is thought to be a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt and the scattered disk to halfway to the nearest star. 
During planet formation interactions of protoplanetary disk objects with the already developed Jupiter and Neptune resulted in the scattered disc and the Oort cloud.
While the Sun was in its birth cluster it may have shared comets from the outskirts protoplanetary discs of other stars.
In the scattering processes during planet formation many planetesimals may have become unbound to solar gravitation and became interstellar objects just like ʻOumuamua the first interstellar object detected passing through the Solar System.
From the Oort cloud long-period comets are disturbed towards the Sun by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars. Long-period comets have highly eccentric orbits and periods ranging from 200 years to millions of years and their orbital inclination is roughly isotropic.
Most comets (several thousands) observed by ground-based observers or automated observatories (e.g. Pan-STARRS) or by near-Earth spacecraft (e.g. SOHO) are long-period comets that had only one apparition. 
Comet Halley and other Halley type comets (HTCs) have periods of 20 to 200 years and inclinations from 0 to 180 degrees. HTCs are believed to derive from long-period comets.
Once a Kuiper belt or scattered disk object is scattered by Neptune into an orbit with a perihelion distance well inside Neptune's orbit its orbit becomes unstable because it will eventually cross the orbits of one or more of the giant planets. Such objects are called Centaurs. Centaur orbits have dynamic lifetimes of only a few million years.
Some centaur orbits will evolve into Jupiter-crossing orbits and become Jupiter family comets, or collide with the Sun or a planet, or they may be ejected into interstellar space. 
Centaurs like 2060 Chiron and 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann display comet-like dust comas.
During their inward migration the top layers (~100 m) of the comet's surface heat up and lose much of the volatile ices CO, N2). CO2-ice sublimates at about Jupiter distance (e.g. 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann).

Most periodic comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) that have orbital periods less than 12 years and aphelia close to Jupiter. JFCs originate from Centaurs. Inside three AU distance from the Sun water ice sublimation becomes the dominant driver of activity but also other volatile ices like CO2 ice play an important role in cometary activity. The sublimated gases carry micron-sized dust grains to form an observable coma and tail during their perihelion passage. Infrared observations show that many JFCs exhibit a debris trail of up to cm-sized particles along the comet's orbit.
When the Earth passes through a comet trail a meteor shower is observed.
The dynamical lifetimes of JFCs is few 105 years before they are eliminated from the Solar System by Jupiter or they collide with a planet or the Sun. However, their active lifetimes are ~10 time shorter because volatile ices vanished from the upper surface layers. They may reawaken again, e.g. when their orbits become much closer to the Sun. Comet Encke is such a case. Its orbit is decoupled from Jupiter; its aphelion distance is only 4.1 AU. It must have been dormant for long time until it reached its present orbit.
As of 2022 eight comets have been visited by spacecraft with remote sensing and fields and particles instrumentation but only for comets 1P/Halley, 81P/Wild 2 and 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko additional compositional analyses were obtained from dust composition analyzers.
Close range measurements of dust from 1P/Comet Halley by the PIA and PUMA dust analyzers onboard the Giotto and Vega spacecraft showed that dust particles had mostly chondritic composition but were rich in light elements such as H, C, N and O.
The Stardust cometary samples were a mix of different components that included presolar grains like SiC grains and high temperature solar nebula condensates like calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in primitive meteorites.

The COSIMA dust composition analyzers on board Rosetta mission measured the D/H ratio in cometary organics and found that it is between the value on Earth and that in solar-like protostellar regions.
The ROSINA gas analyser on Rosetta found that sublimating ice particles are emitted from the active areas on the nucleus. 
Rosetta observations found that 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has a density of only 540 kg/m−3 - much less than any solid material or water ice, therefore, this cometary material is highly porous (~70%). Most of the sub-mm dust particles collected by Rosetta instruments consisted of aggregates of smaller micrometer-sized subunits that may themselves were aggregates of ~100 nm particles.
The temperature at a cometary surface is generally near the local blackbody temperature; which suggests the existence of an inactive dust mantle covering large parts of the surface of the nucleus. Therefore, sublimation of ices from the cometary surface and the consequent emission of the embedded dust is not a simple process. The heat from solar illumination has to reach the lower lying ices and the cohesive dust mantle has to be broken. This process has been observed in lab simulations.
Large outbursts of gas and dust caused by landslides
and even explosions have been observed by Rosetta during its rendezvous with 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.
Sublimation of subsurface supervolatile ices reside at depth much larger than 10 m below the surface. When the solar heat wave reaches this depth it may cause runaway sublimation and subsequent disintegration of the whole nucleus, like in the case of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann. In September 1995, this comet began to disintegrate and to release fragments and large amounts of debris and dust along its orbit.
Other processes leading to splitting of comets are tidal stresses and spin-up disruption of the nucleus. Cometary splitting is a rather common phenomenon at a rate of ~1 per 100 years per comet. This large rate suggests that splitting may be an important destructive process for cometary nuclei and the generation of cometary debris.


=== Asteroids ===

Asteroids are remnants of the protoplanetary disc in a region where gravitational perturbations by Jupiter prevented the accretion of planetesimals into planets. 
The orbit distribution of asteroids is controlled by Jupiter. The greatest concentration of asteroids (main-belt asteroids) have semimajor axes between at 2.06 and 3.27 AU where the strong 4:1 and 2:1 orbital resonances with Jupiter (Kirkwood gaps) lie. Their orbits have eccentricities less than 0.33 and inclinations below 30°. 
At Jupiter distance are the three specific dynamic groups of asteroids. The Trojans share the orbit of Jupiter. They are divided into the Greeks at L4 (ahead of Jupiter) and the Trojans at L5 (trailing Jupiter). The Hilda asteroids are a dynamical group beyond the asteroid belt but within Jupiter's orbit, in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter.
Inside the asteroid belt are Earth-crossing asteroids, that have orbits that pass close to that of Earth. 
Sizes of asteroids range from the large dwarf planet Ceres at ~1000 km diameter down to m-sized objects, below which they are called meteoroids or dust. The size distribution of asteroids smaller than ~100 km in size follows the steady state collisional fragmentation distribution of Dohnanyi.
Most asteroids formed inside the snow line from mostly chondritic planetesimals and protoplanets over 4.54 billion years ago. Once these protoplanets reached a size of several 100 km heating by radioactivity, impacts, and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets and planetary differentiation set in. Heavier elements (iron and nickel) sank to the center, whereas lighter elements (stony materials) rose to the surface. Further collisions in the asteroid belt destroyed such parent objects and left fragments of very different composition and spectral types in emission, color, and albedo. C-type asteroids are the most common variety (~75%) of known asteroids. They are volatile-rich and have very low albedo because their composition includes a large amount of carbon. Reddish M-type asteroids are considered to be remnant cores of early protoplanets, while S-type asteroids (17%) of moderate albedo are fragments of the siliceous crust. These asteroid types are the parents of the respective meteorite classes.
Recently Active asteroid have been observed that eject dust and produce transient, comet-like comae and tails. Potential causes of activity are sublimation of asteroidal ice, impact ejection, rotational instabilities, electrostatic repulsion, and thermal fracture.

 
In the early 1970s the Pioneer 10 and 11 traversed the asteroid belt en route to Jupiter and Saturn. The dust instruments on board, both the penetration detectors and the Zodiacal light instruments did not find an enhanced dust density in the asteroid belt.
In 1983 the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) mapped the infrared sky brightness and several solar system dust bands were found in the data. These dust bands were interpreted to be debris produced by recent collisional disruptions of main-belt asteroids. Detailed analysis of candidate asteroids revealed that collisions in the Veritas asteroid family at 3.17 AU, the Koronis family at 2.86 AU about 8 Myr ago, and the Karin Cluster formed about 5.7 Myr ago from a collision of progenitor asteroids.
In the early 1990s the Galileo space probe took the first photos of the asteroids 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida. 
As of 2022 15 asteroids have been visited by spacecraft with three sample-ret",1
Bernard Simon,"Bernard Simon (1896–1980) was a modernist sculptor from Yedinitz, Bessarabia. He came to New York in 1912 and was part of a Jewish community of artists in Brooklyn. Simon taught sculpture at the Bayonne Art Center, N.J., the Educational Alliance, N.Y., the Museum of Modern Art, N.Y., and at the New School for Social Research, N.Y. His sculptures were figurative during a period when  abstract expressionism was dominant, in the 1950s. He participated in many cooperative artists organizations. 


== Biography ==
Bernard Simon (1896-1980) was raised in Yedinitz, a village in former Bessarabia under Soviet control. Simon's father died when he was 12 years old. In 1912, Simon's mother sent him to New York to avoid Russia's draft for the impending World War. In the city, Simon worked at the family laundry and in sales. With his wife, Edna, he had a daughter, Ruth. However, in the Great Depression took hold, his businesses struggled. Simon turned to sculpture, and had a long career of teaching, making, and exhibiting, until his death in New York City in 1980.


== Career ==
In 1938, Simon began studying with Chaim Gross at the Educational Alliance, New York. Simon and Gross became friends and starting in 1945, Simon spent summers at the art colony in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
In the early 1950s, Simon spent a decade as the Vice President, Treasurer, and Board Member of the New York Artists Equity Association, which was founded in 1947 by 160 artists including Edward Hopper and Yasuo Kuniyoshi. Simon tried to ""influence [the organization's] future in protection of artists in a world where patronage no longer exists."" The association opened the Broome Street Gallery and exhibited work by notable artists including Noguchi, Willem de Kooning, and Chaim Gross. 
By 1977, Simon had exhibited his sculpture in 40 one-man shows. He regularly exhibited in the Silvermine Guild gallery's group shows, in 1958 with Minna Hirkavy, and in 1959 alongside the realist painter, Elizabeth Barker. He showed work in the National Exhibition of the Sarasota Art Association in 1960; the outdoor exhibition at Mari Gallery (Woodstock, New York) in 1961, the Berryman Galleries in Endicott, New York in 1969, and in exhibitions sponsored by the artists' associations to which he belonged. Simon's sculpture, El Torro, is featured in the permanent Provincetown Art Collection. His work was also shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Museum of Natural History in New York.

Torque,"In physics, torque is the tendency of a force to turn or twist. If a force is used to begin to spin an object, or to stop an object from spinning, a torque is made.
The force applied to a lever, multiplied by the distance from the lever's fulcrum, multiplied again by the sine of the angle created, is described as torque. This is also known as ""r cross f,"" or ""force times fulcrum distance times sine theta.""


== Fulcrum ==
Fulcrum is the axis of rotation or point of support on which a lever turns in raising or moving something.


== Equation ==
The equation for torque is:

  
    
      
        
          τ
        
        =
        
          r
        
        ×
        
          F
        
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} \,\!}
  

where F is the net force vector and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting. The Greek letter Tau is used to represent torque. 
The units of torque are force multiplied by distance. The SI unit of torque is the newton-metre.  The most common English unit is the foot-pound.

Wood science,"Wood science is the scientific field which predominantly studies and investigates elements associated with the formation, the physical and chemical composition, and the macro- and microstructure of wood as a bio-based and lignocellulosic material. Wood science additionally delves into the biological, chemical, physical, and mechanical properties and characteristics of wood as a natural material.
Deep understanding of wood plays a pivotal role in several endeavors such as the processing of wood, the production of wood-based materials like particleboard, fiberboard, OSB, plywood and other materials, as well as the utilization of wood and wood-based materials in construction and a wide array of products, including pulpwood, furniture, engineered wood products, such as glued laminated timber, CLT, LVL, PSL, as well as pellets, briquettes, and numerous wood-derived products.


== History ==
Initial comprehensive investigations in the field of wood science emerged at the start of the 20th century. In 1902, the Wood Processing Laboratory was founded in the Department of Forestry at Tokyo University and academic studies on wood processing were first initiated. The Forest and Forest Products Research Institute in Tokyo was also established in 1905. In 1906 the Forest Products Research Institute was created in Dehradun, India.
The advent of contemporary wood research commenced in 1910, when the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) was established in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The Forest Products Laboratory played a fundamental role in wood science providing scientific research on wood and wood products in partnership with academia, industry, local and other institutions in North and South America and worldwide. 
In the following years, many wood research institutes came into existence across almost all industrialized nations. A general overview of these institutes and laboratories is shown below:

1913: Institute of Wood and Pulp Chemistry Eberswalde (today's Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development), Germany
1913: Forest Products Laboratory Montreal, Canada
1918: Forest Products Laboratory Vancouver, Canada

1954: Faculty of Wood Technology, Poznan University (today's Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology at Poznan), Poland
From the '60s, the founding of research institutes in the field of wood sciences continued in many universities, and also in universities of applied sciences and technological universities. Today, the International Academy of Wood Science (IAWS), a recognised and non-profit assembly of wood scientists, represents worldwide the scientific area of wood science and all of its associated technological domains.


== Sub-areas ==

The field of wood science can be categorized into three distinct sub-areas, which include:

Wood biology, a subset of wood science which focuses on the formation, structure and composition of wood tissues. It involves investigations conducted at the macroscopic, microscopic, and molecular levels. Additionally, this sub-field encompasses wood anatomy which involves the (macroscopic - microscopic) identification of various wood species.
Wood chemistry, whose primary focus is the analysis of the chemical constituents comprising wood, with specific emphasis on cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses, and extractives, as well as on the various products derived from these components. It is also explores potential uses for pulp and paper production, the utilization of wood and wood waste, the generation of energy and chemicals from pulping byproducts, and the conversion of biomass.
Wood physics, which constitutes an essential component of the field of wood science, building upon discoveries in wood chemistry, wood anatomy (xylem), and biology, as well as principles from classical physics, mechanics, and materials strength. Wood physics encompasses critical research areas including: a) examining wood behaviour in relation to moisture, which involves fundamental aspects of moisture absorption, swelling, and shrinkage, b) investigating the impact of temperature on wood properties, encompassing heat conduction and heat storage, and c) assessing the mechanical, rheological, and acoustic properties and qualities of both wood and wood-based products.

Devil,"In some religions and mythology, the Devil, otherwise referred to as the God of Darkness or Dark God, is an evil spirit or a deity, demon or supernatural being that tries to create problems for people and distance them from God. In some cultures, the Devil is seen as the embodiment of evil. He is characterised by his red skin, horns and tail.
Some people also use the word ""satan"" for the most powerful devil. 


== Etymology ==
The word ""devil"" comes from the Greek word ""diabolos"" which means ""someone who tells lies to hurt you"". (""Diabolos"" is translated to the English word ""slanderer."") The New Testament uses ""diabolos"" as a title for Satan, so ""the Devil"" became another name for Satan in English.
In the Old Testament, there is the Serpent and Satan the Evil One, who may be two different characters. ""Satan"" in Hebrew means ""adversary"", which is a word for an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also a word used for the Devil in the Koran, who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.


== Appearances in religions ==


=== Christianity ===
According to Christianity, the Devil wanted to be a deity besides God and be independent from God. Therefore, a war in heaven started and the angels battled. After the Devil lose the battle and was thrown out of heaven, he started doing bad things on the earth. He wants people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.
The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things.
The Book of Revelation says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in Hell. This will happen in the future.
Some Christians understand the Devil as the embodiment of chaos and death. They think that the Devil is the farthest someone can get away from God. God, as the opposite of the Devil, stands for life and the Devil for death. The closer someone gets to the Devil the closer people come to death and will not be resurrected.


=== Islam ===
In Islam, there is not only one devil, but there are several devils, who support Satan. The devils are invisible and tempt humans and djinns into sin. Humans and djinns, who follow the will of the devils, are called devils too.


=== Other cultures and religions ===
Not all religions believe in the Devil. For example, some forms of Buddhism do not believe in the Devil. Judaism, has Satan, but does not believe that Satan is the Devil, but only an angel. 
In Wicca, the concept of the Devil and demons is also rejected, simply because, in Wiccan tradition, the creative energy is neither positive nor negative. According to Wiccans: ""We are the ones who use this energy for good or evil. Therefore, the consequence of this action is our entire responsibility, not of an evil supernatural being."" The corniferous god Cernunnos of Wicca was confused with the Christian Devil, for having horns (in antiquity, given the horns were phallic, they were associated with virility (fertility)), and were soon symbols of ancient European religions. He was already worshipped by pagan religions before Christianity arrived in Europe and the British Isles. Many satanists believe in the Devil or Satan only as a metaphor, not an actual being or person. In the Bahá'í Faith, the Devil as a malevolent, supernatural entity is not believed to exist. These terms do, however, appear in the Bahá'í writings, where they are instead used as metaphors for the lower nature of man.


== Arts ==
Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. But nobody knows what he may look like in fact. Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see, but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people. Many modern depictions of the Devil portray him as a red human-like being with horns and a pointed tail, carrying a red pitchfork or trident.

Janka hardness test,"The Janka hardness test (English: ; German: [ˈjaŋka]), created by Austrian-born American researcher Gabriel Janka (1864–1932), measures the resistance of a sample of wood to denting and wear. It measures the force required to embed an 11.28-millimeter-diameter (7⁄16 in) steel ball halfway into a sample of wood. (The diameter was chosen to produce a circle with an area of 100 square millimeters, or one square centimeter.) 
A common use of Janka hardness ratings is to determine whether a species is suitable for use as flooring. For hardwood flooring, the test usually requires an 80 mm × 150 mm (3 in × 6 in) sample with a thickness of at least 6–8 mm, and the most commonly used test is the ASTM D1037. When testing wood in lumber form, the Janka test is always carried out on wood from the tree trunk (known as the heartwood), and the standard sample (according to ASTM D143) is at 12% moisture content and clear of knots.
The hardness of wood varies with the direction of the wood grain. Testing on the surface of a plank, perpendicular to the grain, is said to be of ""side hardness"". Testing the cut surface of a stump is called a test of ""end hardness"". Side hardness may be further divided into ""radial hardness"" and ""tangential hardness"", although the differences are minor and often neglected.
The results are stated in various ways, leading to confusion, especially when the actual units employed are often not attached. The resulting measure is always one of force. In the United States, the measurement is in pounds-force (lbf). In Sweden, it is in kilograms-force (kgf), and in Australia, either in newtons (N) or kilonewtons (kN). This confusion is greatest when the results are treated as units, for example ""660 Janka"".
The Janka hardness test results tabulated below followed ASTM D 1037-12 testing methods. Lumber stocks tested range from 1"" to 2"" (25–50 mm) thick. The tabulated Janka hardness numbers are an average. There is a standard deviation associated with each species, but these values are not given. No testing was done on actual flooring. 
Other factors affect how flooring performs: the type of core for engineered floorings, such as pine, HDF, poplar, oak, or birch; grain direction and thickness; floor or top wear surface, etc. The chart is not to be considered an absolute; it is meant to help people understand which woods are harder than others.

Genipa americana,"Genipa americana () is a species of trees in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical forests of North and South America, as well as the Caribbean.


== Description ==
Genipa americana trees are up to 30 m tall and up to 60 cm dbh. Their bark is smooth with little fissures. The leaves are opposite, obovate, or obovate oblong, 10–35 cm long, 6–13 cm wide, and glossy dark green, with entire margin, acute or acuminate apex, and attenuated base. The inflorescences are cymes up to 10 cm long. The flowers are white to yellowish, slightly fragrant, calyx bell-shaped, corolla at 2–4.5 cm long, trumpet-shaped, and five- or six-lobed. The five short stamens are inserted on top of the corolla tube. The fruit is a thick-skinned edible greyish berry 10–12 cm long, 5–9 cm in diameter.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Genipa americana is native to the tropical forests of the Americas, from the Caribbean south to Argentina. It is present from sea level up to 1200 m of elevation, although some argue the original native range as being northern South America.


== Vernacular names ==
In English, the tree is known as the genip tree  and the fruit as genipap .
Colombia: jagua, caruto, huito; Brazil: jenipapo, formerly genipapo; Costa Rica: guaitil, tapaculo; Nicaragua: tapaculo, yigualtí; Mexico: shagua, xagua, maluco; Perú: huito, vito, jagua; Argentina: ñandipá; Puerto Rico: jagua; Bolivia: bí
Its name has been reconstructed as we'e (*weʔe) in Proto-Tucanoan.


== Chemical compounds ==
The following compounds have been isolated from G. americana: genipic acid, genipinic acid, genipin (all three from the fruit) and geniposidic acid (leaves).


== Uses ==
The unripe fruit of G. americana yields a liquid used as a dye for tattoos, skin painting, insect repellent and food.
This species is also cultivated for its edible fruits, which are eaten in preserves or made into drinks, jelly, or ice cream.
The wood is reported to be resistant, strong, and easily worked; it is used in the making of utensils and in construction and carpentry.

They ""account for a large share of the overall kilometres travelled, especially by air."" These people contribute significantly to the overall amount of air miles flown within a given society.  Although concerns over hypermobility apply to several modes of transport, the environmental impact of aviation and especially its greenhouse gas emissions have brought particular focus on flying. Among the reasons for this focus is that these emissions, because they are made at high altitude, have a climate impact that is commonly estimated to be 2.7 higher, than the same emissions if made at ground-level.
Although the amount of time people have spent in motion has remained constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold.  This results in the twin effects of wider, and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which can be seen as a form of virtual mobility), and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer Donald Appleyard).
The changes are brought about locally due to the use of cars and motorways, and internationally by aeroplanes.  Some of the social threats of hypermobility include:

more polarisation between rich and poor
reduced health and fitness
Compulsive travel has been proposed as a model of addiction in one paper.
Widespread Internet use is seen as a contributory factor towards hypermobility due to the increased ease which it enables travel to be desired and organized. On the other hand, the proliferation of online communication tools as an alternative to in-person meetings has been linked to a 25% decrease in business travel by UK residents from 2000 to 2010.
The term hypermobility arose around 1980 concerning the flow of capital, and since the early 1990s has also referred to excessive travel. [See: Hepworth and Ducatel (1992); Whitelegg (1993); Lowe (1994); van der Stoep (1995); Shields (1996); Cox (1997); Adams (1999); Khisty and Zeitler (2001); Gössling et al. (2009); Mander & Randles (2009); and (Higham 2014).] The term is widely credited as having been coined by Adams (1999), but apart from the title of the work it says nothing explicit about it except that ""[t]he term hypermobility is used in this essay to suggest that it may be possible to have too much of a good thing.""

Weather,"Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, ""weather"" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.
Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream. Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow.  Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Earth's weather system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns. 
Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.


== Causes ==

On Earth, common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.
Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences from one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude in the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.

Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).
The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.  Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which is the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or human-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this airflow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena.  Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.
The atmosphere is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to one part of the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tidal waves or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.


== Shaping the planet Earth ==

Weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in erosion of the surface.


== Effect on humans ==

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, the effect it has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about. The National Weather Service has an annual report for fatalities, injury, and total damage costs which include crop and property. They gather this data via National Weather Service offices located throughout the 50 states in the United States as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. As of 2019, tornadoes have had the greatest impact on humans with 42 fatalities while costing crop and property damage over 3 billion dollars.


=== Effects on populations ===

The weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in human history. Aside from climatic changes that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the desertification of the Middle East, and the formation of land bridges during glacial periods), extreme weather events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events. One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the Mongol fleet of Kublai Khan by the Kamikaze winds in 1281. French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet, allowing Spain to conquer Fort Caroline. More recently, Hurricane Katrina redistributed over one million people from the central Gulf coast elsewhere across the United States, becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the United States.
The Little Ice Age caused crop failures and famines in Europe. During the period known as the Grindelwald Fluctuation (1560–1630), volcanic forcing events seem to have led to more extreme weather events. These included droughts, storms and unseasonal blizzards, as well as causing the Swiss Grindelwald Glacier to expand. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697, during which about one-third of the Finnish population died.


== Forecasting ==

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since at least the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.
Once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now used to determine future conditions. On the other hand, human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.
The chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as of the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.
There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property.  Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.
In some areas, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead to survive through them.
Tropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least on average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth's surface) is perpendicular to the Earth's axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth's rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low latitudes. Because of these two factors, clouds and rainstorms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere. Because of these differences, clouds and rain are more difficult to forecast in the tropics than at higher latitudes. On the other hand, the temperature is easily forecast in the tropics, because it does not change much.


== Modification ==
The aspiration to control the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail. A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of Beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing's Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.
Whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques' efficacy, there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:

Acid rain, caused by industrial emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, adversely affects freshwater lakes, vegetation, and structures.
Anthropogenic pollutants reduce air quality and visibility.
Climate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, extreme temperatures, flooding, high winds, and severe storms.
Heat, generated by large metropolitan areas have been shown to minutely affect nearby weather, even at distances as far as 1,600 kilometres (990 mi).
The effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization, including ecosystems, natural resources, food and fiber production, economic development, and human health.


== Microscale meteorology ==
Microscale meteorology is the study of short-lived atmospheric phenomena smaller than mesoscale, about 1 km or less. These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as ""mesoscale and microscale meteorology"" (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map. These include small and generally fleeting cloud ""puffs"" and other small cloud features.


== Extremes on Earth ==

On Earth, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (100 °F to −40 °F) annually. The range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range. The coldest air temperature ever recorded on Earth is −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F), at Vostok Station, Antarctica on 21 July 1983. The hottest air temperature ever recorded was 57.7 °C (135.9 °F) at 'Aziziya, Libya, on 13 September 1922, but that reading is queried. The highest recorded average annual temperature was 34.4 °C (93.9 °F) at Dallol, Ethiopia. The coldest recorded average annual temperature was −55.1 °C (−67.2 °F) at Vostok Station, Antarctica.
The coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at Eureka, Nunavut, in Canada, where the annual average temperature is −19.7 °C (−3.5 °F).
The windiest place ever recorded is in Antarctica, Commonwealth Bay (George V Coast). Here the gales reach 199 mph (320 km/h). Furthermore, the greatest snowfall in a period of twelve months occurred in Mount Rainier, Washington, US. It was recorded as 31,102 mm (102.04 ft) of snow.


== Extraterrestrial weather ==

Studying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on Earth. Weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on Earth, but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition. The Cassini–Huygens mission to Titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds. Earth's atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones, three in each hemisphere. In contrast, Jupiter's banded appearance shows many such zones, Titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude, and Venus has a single jet near the equator.
One of the most famous landmarks in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. On other giant planets, the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds: gusts of up to 600 metres per second (about 2,100 km/h or 1,300 mph) have been measured on the planet Neptune. This has created a puzzle for planetary scientists. The weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by Neptune is only about 1⁄900 of that received by Earth, yet the intensity of weather phenomena on Neptune is far greater than on Earth. As of 2007, the strongest planetary winds discovered are on the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b, which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than 9,600 kilometres per hour (6,000 mph).


== Space weather ==

Weather is not limited to planetary bodies. Like all stars, the Sun's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind. Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as coronal mass ejections, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather. Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the Solar System as Saturn. The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces. The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae, and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals.

Cuban art,"Cuban art has been known since the 16th century.
In the 16th century, painters and sculptors began arriving from Europe. They made decorations (including paintings and sculptures), in Cuban churches and public buildings. By the mid-1700s, native-born artists were painting in Cuba, in the European tradition of painting.

Many works of art were left behind by José Nicolás de la Escalera (d. 1804). For many of those works, there is proof that he was the one who painted those.
Vicente Escobar (d. 1834) was a mestizo, and he did portraits; His paintings were popular with Cuba's elite (or people with wealth or political power). He opened [the first, or] one of the first painting workshop/studios in Cuba. He later graduated from the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.
Víctor Patricio de Landaluze (d. 1889) was a Spanish-born artist, and he was an early artist of the costumbrismo genre. He was opposed to Cuban independence, and that cost him some of his popularity with the public.


== After the Colonial Era ==
By the late 1920s [an Avant-garde movement,] the Vanguardia, had rejected convention [or some norms] of Cuba's national art academy. Most of the Vanguardia artists had been students at the national art academy. Many had lived in Paris (France), where they learned (more) about Surrealism, Cubism, and modernist Primitivism. Those genres (or styles) gave inspiration to the Vanguardia artists.
Pioneer s (or the first to be part) of the movement included Eduardo Abela, Antonio Gattorno, Victor Manuel, Fidelio Ponce de León, and Carlos Enríquez Gómez. Other famous artists of the original Vanguardia were Amelia Peláez, Jorge Arche, Marcelo Pogolotti, Aristides Fernandez, Rafael Blanco, Domingo Ravenet, Alberto Peña, and Lorenzo Romero Arciaga.
The painting [""the tropical gypsy"",] La Gitana Tropical (1929), has been called one of the defining pieces (or paintings) of Cuban Avant-garde art. Victor Manuel painted it. During stays in Paris, he had been impressed by the works of Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin. (The painting is in a museum in Havana, Cuba.)
Between 1934 and 1940, Cuba was searching for its cultural identity in its European and African roots. The landscape, flora, fauna, and lore of the island, as well as its peasants - the often neglected, but important part of Cuba's soul and economy - was shown, more and more, in its art.
In 1938, the Second National Salon of Painting and Sculpture, showed art works. Some of the artists there, have been called part of a second generation of modern artists, including Cundo Bermudez, Mario Carreño, Rita Longa, Alfredo Lozano, Luis Martinez-Pedro, and René Portocarrero
The painting The Jungle (1943) has been called a masterpiece (or a painting by a master) of Cuban art. The artist, Wifredo Lam, is not thought of, as being a part of the Vanguardia movement. (The painting is in a museum in the United States. It was bought in 1945.)
In 1944 in New York City (USA), the art exhibition ""Modern Cuban Painters"" was held at MoMA. That year Mario Carreño had a solo exhibition (or his own exhibition) at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
In 1951 in Paris (France), an exhibition of modern Cuban art was shown at the Musée National d'Art Moderne.
After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, some artists made a decision to leave Cuba. Because the creation of art, was sponsored (or paid for) by the Cuban government, implied censorship occurred, since artists wouldn't want to make art that was against the government that was financing (or paying for) the art.
In the 1960s and 1970s conceptual art was introduced. Minimalism, Earth art, and Performance art was (sometimes) mixed with conceptual art
In 1984 the first Havana Biennial was held. (There have been biennials as late as 2015 and 2019, and the one in 2021 was boycotted by hundreds of artists [and many foreign spectators].

In 1997 in New York City (USA), the exhibition Naïve Art in Cuba, was held at Metropolitan Arts Center. It showed  the art of fourteen Cuban artists of Naïve art, and art from eight members of the Grupo Bayate, an artists' collective (or group) from Mella, Santiago de Cuba. 
As of 2015, few artists of Naïve art have had works shown at art salons (or other exhibitions, such as) the biennial of Havana.

Phonotrope,"The Phonotrope is the term coined by animation director Jim Le Fevre to describe the technique of creating animation in a 'live' environment using the confluence of the frame rate of a live action camera and the revolutions of a constantly rotating disc, predominantly (but not exclusively) using a record player.
It is a contemporary reworking of the phenakistiscope, one of several pre-film animation devices that produce the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of pictures showing progressive phases of that motion.
The crucial difference between the technique that the Phonotrope uses and the one a phenakistiscope uses is that the Phonotrope is specifically an in-camera technique using the frame-rate of a live-action camera set to a high shutter speed in confluence with a constantly rotating disc to create the illusion of movement. In a phenakistiscope it is the vertical slits in the circumference of the disc that create the stroboscopic interruptions needed for animation. As such the Phonotrope can only be seen through either the camera's viewfinder, a connected monitor or projector or viewed as footage after the event. Timed flashes of a strobe light can also animate the imagery.
From its inception the most commonly used methods of rotating the disc have been using a record-player. However, Le Fevre has also used a pottery wheel to spin a glazed pot to create animation as well as a bespoke motor to animate hundreds of cut-out card images on a two-meter-high (6.6 ft) wooden tiered structure for the title sequence for the BBC television comedy film Holy Flying Circus.


== Public appearances ==
The earliest public showing of the Phonotrope was in March 2007 at an evening at the Victoria and Albert Museum where Jim Le Fevre presented the process to members of the public as part of a 'Friday Late' event. Footage from the event was posted on YouTube in 2008.
In 2008 Le Fevre gave a talk at ""Interesting 2008"", a series of time-restricted lectures in Holborn, London, organised by Russell Davies 
In 2009 Le Fevre gave a talk on the Phonotrope at the Flatpack Film Festival and in 2010 Le Fevre performed an evening at the ICA with music DJ Malcolm Goldie for the ICA's Heavy Pencil night.
Since 2010 Le Fevre has performed workshops and talks on the Phonotrope nationally  and internationally.


== Naming ==
The term Phonotrope was coined in 2010 by Jim Le Fevre. He previously termed his version of the technique the Phonographanstasmascope as a nod to the convoluted names of its ancestors, like the phonograph, the phenakistiscope (originally dubbed phantasmascope by inventor Joseph Plateau), the zoetrope, the praxinoscope and the zoopraxiscope, but realised it was too cumbersome to use.


== In advertising and broadcast ==
In 2007 Jim Le Fevre used the Phonotropic technique to create an onscreen ident for MTV called ""MTV - Turntable"" and in 2010 he created a 2-meter-tall (6.6 ft) Terry Gilliam inspired Phonontrope for the title sequence for the BBC television comedy film Holy Flying Circus.  In 2013 Le Fevre (with Rupert and Alice Johnstone from RAMP ceramics) created a Phonotropic film using a pottery wheel for the Crafts Council of England.

Spondulix,"Spondulix is 19th-century slang for money or cash, more specifically a reasonable amount of spending money. Spondulicks, spondoolicks, spondulacks, spondulics, and spondoolics are alternative spellings, and spondoolies is a modern variant.


== Etymology ==
There are two views on the origin of the word.


=== Latin ===
It is possible that it could come from the Latin verb spondēre, meaning ""to promise"".  Bank notes in England and elsewhere in the 19th century stated ""I promise to pay the bearer ...."" (the equivalent of the value of the note).  Bank notes today continue with this promise.


=== Greek ===
It has been asserted that Greek spondulox, which refers to a type of seashell from bivalves of the genus Spondylus. 
The Spondylus shell was used as neolithic jewelry and also as an early form of currency.

There is global evidence of the importance of the spondylus shell. Archaeological evidence shows that people in Europe were trading the shells as jewelry as long as 5,000 years ago. Spondylus shells from the Aegean Sea were harvested and then worked into bracelets, bangles and ornaments and transported throughout the continent. It is thought that the shells were also traded as an early form of currency due to their mother-of-pearl-like appearance. There may also be a connection with spondylo-, a prefix which means spine or vertebrae, based on the similarity between a stack of coins and a spine. This is referenced in an 1867 book by John Mitchell Bonnell and quotes etymologist Michael Quinion's correspondence with a Doug Wilson linking the spine to piled coins; thus ""Spondulics - coin piled for counting..."".


== Early written use ==
The earliest recorded occurrence of the word as slang for money appears to have been in the late 19th century in the United States. The New Oxford Dictionary of English marks the origin as US slang. However, according to the Cassell Dictionary of Slang, the term can be traced back to the mid-19th century in England.
Other sources also suggest a mid-19th-century origin. The July 1852 edition of the Water-Cure Journal includes ""Gossip from Indiana"" by ""a Hoosier"" which complains about ""spending our spondulix."" In Meister Karl's Sketch-Book (1855), Charles Godfrey Leland includes it in a long list of synonyms for money: "" . . . the magic spell of the ready—otherwise known as money, cash, tin, stuff, rhino, root-of-all-evil, blunt, wherewhital, rowdy, funds, stumpy, pecuniary, dibs, hard, browns, heavy, mopusses, slugs, shiners, lucre, or 'the filthy,' dust, gelt, chips, lumps, chinkers, mint-drops, pewter, brass, horsenails, rocks, brads, spondulix, needful, dough, spoons, buttons, dimes, or the infallible . . ."" The spelling ""spondulicks"" appeared in an 1858 edition of Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine: ""Steve, if the Court recollects herself, then you come up with the spondulicks, and Bill Bresse tuck down Lem's pile."" Louisa May Alcott's Eight Cousins (1875)  has a variant spelling in Charlie's statement that, ""we have plenty of 'spondulics,' so we can rather lord it over the other fellows and do as we like.""
""Spondulix"" is used by 19th-century American author Bret Harte in his 1891 story ""A Sappho of Green Springs"": ""MR. EDITOR, — I see you have got my poetry in.  But I don't see the spondulix that oughter follow.""; in Chapter XIII of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the riverboat captain tells Huck that he wouldn't forsake a sailor's life ""for all [old Jim Hornback's] spondulicks and as much more..."" It is also mentioned in the short story ""Ivy Day in the Committee Room"" from the collection Dubliners (1914) by Irish novelist James Joyce. In the 1916 Charlie Chaplin silent film The Floorwalker, a title card proclaims ""Spondulicks Forever!"" after Chaplin appears to rejoice upon recovering a suitcase full of greenbacks.

Money,"Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. The primary functions which distinguish money are: medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.
Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possessed intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use value. Its value is consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for ""all debts, public and private"", in the case of the United States dollar.
The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation (banknotes and coins currently issued) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.


== Etymology ==
The word money derives from the Latin word moneta with the meaning ""coin"" via French monnaie. The Latin word is believed to originate from a temple of Juno, on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the ancient world, Juno was often associated with money. The temple of Juno Moneta at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located. The name ""Juno"" may have derived from the Etruscan goddess Uni and ""Moneta"" either from the Latin word ""monere"" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word ""moneres"" (alone, unique).
In the Western world a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie, stemming from Latin in specie, meaning ""in kind"".


== History ==

The use of barter-like methods may date back to at least 100,000 years ago, though there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter. Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of gift economy and debt. When barter did in fact occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies.
Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of commodity money. The Mesopotamian shekel was a unit of weight, and relied on the mass of something like 160 grains of barley. The first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. Societies in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used shell money—often, the shells of the cowry (Cypraea moneta L. or C. annulus L.). According to Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coins. It is thought by modern scholars that these first stamped coins were minted around 650 to 600 BC.

The system of commodity money eventually evolved into a system of representative money. This occurred because gold and silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors, redeemable for the commodity money deposited. Eventually, these receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used as money. Paper money or banknotes were first used in China during the Song dynasty. These banknotes, known as ""jiaozi"", evolved from promissory notes that had been used since the 7th century. However, they did not displace commodity money and were used alongside coins. In the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the accounts of travellers, such as Marco Polo and William of Rubruck. Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled ""How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country."" Banknotes were first issued in Europe by Stockholms Banco in 1661 and were again also used alongside coins. The gold standard, a monetary system where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the 17th–19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made legal tender, and redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century, almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.
After World War II and the Bretton Woods Conference, most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar was in turn fixed to gold. In 1971 the U.S. government suspended the convertibility of the dollar to gold. After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments' fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods via payment. According to proponents of modern money theory, fiat money is also backed by taxes. By imposing taxes, states create demand for the currency they issue.


== Functions ==

In Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Stanley Jevons famously analyzed money in terms of four functions: a medium of exchange, a common measure of value (or unit of account), a standard of value (or standard of deferred payment), and a store of value. By 1919, Jevons's four functions of money were summarized in the couplet:

Money's a matter of functions four,
A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.
This couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics textbooks. Most modern textbooks now list only three functions, that of medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, not considering a standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the others.
There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange conflicts with its role as a store of value: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate. Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time. The term ""financial capital"" is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniformly recognized tender.


=== Medium of exchange ===

When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a medium of exchange. It thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the inability to permanently ensure ""coincidence of wants"". For example, between two parties in a barter system, one party may not have or make the item that the other wants, indicating the non-existence of the coincidence of wants. Having a medium of exchange can alleviate this issue because the former can have the freedom to spend time on other items, instead of being burdened to only serve the needs of the latter. Meanwhile, the latter can use the medium of exchange to seek for a party that can provide them with the item they want.


=== Measure of value ===

A unit of account (in economics) is a standard numerical monetary unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a ""measure"" or ""standard"" of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt.
Money acts as a standard measure and a common denomination of trade. It is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices. It is necessary for developing efficient accounting systems like double-entry bookkeeping.


=== Standard of deferred payment ===

While standard of deferred payment is distinguished by some texts, particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other functions. A ""standard of deferred payment"" is an accepted way to settle a debt—a unit in which debts are denominated, and the status of money as legal tender, in those jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real value of debts may change due to inflation and deflation, and for sovereign and international debts via debasement and devaluation.


=== Store of value ===

To act as a store of value, money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved—and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value.


== Properties ==
The functions of money are that it is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. To fulfill these various functions, money must be:

Fungible: its individual units must be capable of mutual substitution (i.e., interchangeability).
Durable: able to withstand repeated use.
Divisible: divisible to small units.
Portable: easily carried and transported.
Acceptable: most people must accept the money as payment
Scarce: its supply in circulation must be limited.


== Money supply ==

In economics, money is any financial instrument that can fulfill the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively referred to as the money supply of an economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments (usually currency, demand deposits, and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a monetary aggregate.
Economists employ different ways to measure the stock of money or money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system that focuses on the liquidity of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2, and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2, etc. may be different in different countries.
Another measure of money, M0, is also used. M0 is base money, or the amount of money actually issued by the central bank of a country. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the reserve requirements of commercial banks.


=== Creation of money ===

In current economic systems, money is created by two procedures:
Legal tender, or narrow money (M0) is the cash created by a Central Bank by minting coins and printing banknotes.
Bank money, or broad money (M1/M2) is the money created by private banks through the recording of loans as deposits of borrowing clients, with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, bank money is created as electronic money.
Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.
In most countries, the majority of money is mostly created as M1/M2 by commercial banks making loans. Contrary to some popular misconceptions, banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and do not depend on central bank money (M0) to create new loans and deposits.


=== Market liquidity ===

""Market liquidity"" describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognized and accepted as a common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the freedom to trade goods and services easily without having to barter.
Liquid financial instruments are easily tradable and have low transaction costs. There should be no (or minimal) spread between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.


== Types ==


=== Commodity ===

Many items have been used as commodity money such as naturally scarce precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads, etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity. Examples of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction with one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. The use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic unit of account for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content. American Eagles are imprinted with their gold content and legal tender face value.


=== Representative ===

In 1875, the British economist William Stanley Jevons described the money used at the time as ""representative money"". Representative money is money that consists of token coins, paper money or other physical tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed quantity of a commodity such as gold or silver. The value of representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.


=== Fiat ===

Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve System in the U.S.) to be legal tender, making it unlawful not to accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.
Some bullion coins such as the Australian Gold Nugget and American Eagle are legal tender, however, they trade based on the market price of the metal content as a commodity, rather than their legal tender face value (which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion value).
Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins), can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the same laws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed. By contrast, commodity money that has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.


=== Coinage ===

These factors led to the shift of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, and at one point there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of the metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics).
In most major economies using coinage, copper, silver, and gold formed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the military, and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of account for taxes, dues, contracts, and fealty, while copper coins represented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient India since the time of the Mahajanapadas. In Europe, this system worked through the medieval period because there was virtually no new gold, silver, or copper introduced through mining or conquest. Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.


=== Paper ===

In premodern China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led to the introduction of paper money. This economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late Tang dynasty (618–907) into the Song dynasty (960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as promissory notes from shops of wholesalers, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the Song dynasty government began circulating these notes amongst the traders in their monopolized salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; it was not until the mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of woodblock printing and then Pi Sheng's movable type printing by the 11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern China.

At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by economists, traders and merchants of the Muslim world include the earliest uses of credit, cheques, savings accounts, transactional accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt, and banking institutions for loans and deposits.
In Europe, paper money was first introduced in Sweden in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made. The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the risks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier since the specie (gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of stock in joint stock companies, and the redemption of those shares in the paper.
However, these advantages are held within their disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.
At this time both silver and gold were considered legal tender, and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the instability in the ratio between the two grew over the 19th century, with the increase both in the supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called bimetallism and the attempt to create a bimetallic standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of inflationists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States greenback, to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.

By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of a gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private banks and governments across the world followed Gresham's law: keeping gold and silver paid but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971.
No country anywhere in the world today has an enforceable gold standard or silver standard currency system.


=== Commercial bank ===

Commercial bank money or demand deposits are claims against financial institutions that can be used for the purchase of goods and services. A demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving the bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the legal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or through online banking.
Commercial bank money is created by commercial banks whose reserves (held as cash and other highly liquid assets) typically constitute only a fraction of their deposits, while the banks maintain an obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand - a practise known as fractional-reserve banking. Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent.
The money multiplier theory presents the process of creating commercial bank money as a multiple (greater than 1) of the amount of base money created by the country's central bank, the multiple itself being a function of the legal regulation of banks imposed by financial regulators (e.g., potential reserve requirements) beside the business policies of commercial banks and the preferences of households - factors which the central bank can influence, but not control completely. Contemporary central banks generally do not control the creation of money, nor do they try to, though their interest rate-setting monetary policies naturally affect the amount of loans and deposits that commercial banks create.


=== Digital or electronic ===

The development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990, in the United States all money transferred between its central bank and commercial banks was in electronic form. By the 2000s most money existed as digital currency in bank databases. In 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic (dependent on country).
Anonymous digital currencies were developed in the early 2000s. Early examples include Ecash, bit gold, RPOW, and b-money. Not much innovation occurred until the conception of Bitcoin in 2008, which introduced the concept of a decentralised currency that requires no trusted third party.


== Monetary policy ==

When gold and silver were used as money, the money supply could grow only if the supply of these metals was increased by mining. This rate of increase would accelerate during periods of gold rushes and discoveries, such as when Columbus traveled to the New World and brought back gold and silver to Spain, or when gold was discovered in California in 1848. This caused inflation, as the value of gold went down. However, if the rate of gold mining could not keep up with the growth of the economy, gold became relatively more valuable, and prices (denominated in gold) would drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the more typical situation for over a century when gold and paper money backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Modern-day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer tied to the value of gold. The amount of money in the economy is influenced by monetary policy, which is the process by which a central bank influences the economy to achieve specific goals. Often, the goal of monetary policy is to maintain low and stable inflation, directly via an inflation targeting strategy, or indirectly via a fixed exchange rate system against a major currency with a stable inflation rate. In some cases, the central bank may pursue various supplementary goals. For example, it is clearly stated in the Federal Reserve Act that the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee should seek ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""
A failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an economy and the society that depends on it. These include hyperinflation, stagflation, recession, high unemployment, shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption of a much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Monetary policy strategies have changed over time. Some of the tools used to conduct contemporary monetary policy include:

changing the interest rate at which the central bank loans money to (or borrows money from) the commercial banks
open market operations including currency purchases or sales
forward guidance, i.e. publishing forecasts to communicate the likely future course of monetary policy
raising or lowering bank reserve requirements
In the U.S., the Federal Reserve is responsible for conducting monetary policy, while in the eurozone the respective institution is the European Central Bank. Other central banks with a significant impact on global finances are the Bank of Japan, People's Bank of China and the Bank of England.
During the 1970s and 1980s monetary policy in several countries was influenced by an economic theory known as monetarism. Monetarism argued that management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s was a key finding of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz supported by the work of David Laidler, and many others. It turned out, however, that maintaining a monetary policy strategy of targeting the money supply did not work very well: The relation between money growth and inflation was not as tight as expected by monetarist theory, and the short-run relation between the money supply and the interest rate, which is the chief instrument through which the cental bank can influence output and inflation, was unreliable. Both problems were due to unpredictable shifts in the demand for money. Consequently, starting in the early 1990s a fundamental reorientation took place in most major central banks, starting to target inflation directly instead of the money supply and using the interest rate as their main instrument.


== Locality ==

The definition of money says it is money only ""in a particular country or socio-economic context"". In general, communities only use a single measure of value, which can be identified in the prices of goods listed for sale. There might be multiple media of exchange, which can be observed by what is given to purchase goods (""medium of exchange""), etc. In most countries, the government acts to encourage a particular forms of money, such as requiring it for taxes and punishing fraud.
Some places do maintain two or more currencies, particularly in border towns or high-travel areas. Shops in these locations might list prices and accept payment in multiple currencies. Otherwise, foreign currency is treated as a financial asset in the local market. Foreign currency is commonly bought or sold on foreign exchange markets by travelers and traders.
Communities can change the money they use, which is known as currency substitution. This can happen intentionally, when a government issues a new currency. For example, when Brazil moved from the Brazilian cruzeiro to the Brazilian real. It can also happen spontaneously, when the people refuse to accept a currency experiencing hyperinflation (even if its use is encouraged by the government).
The money used by a community can change on a smaller scale. This can come through innovation, such as the adoption of cheques (checks). Gresham's law says that ""bad money drives out good"". That is, when buying a good, a person is more likely to pass on less-desirable items that qualify as ""money"" and hold on to more valuable ones. For example, coins with less silver in them (but which are still valid coins) are more likely to circulate in the community. This may effectively change the money used by a community.
The money used by a community does not have to be a currency issued by a government. A famous example of community adopting a new form of money is prisoners-of-war using cigarettes to trade.


== Financial crimes ==


=== Counterfeiting ===

Counterfeit money is imitation currency produced without the legal sanction of the state or government. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as money itself. Plated copies (known as Fourrées) have been found of Lydian coins which are thought to be among the first western coins. Historically, objects that were difficult to counterfeit (e.g. shells, rare stones, precious metals) were often chosen as money. Before the introduction of paper money, the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver. A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During World War II, the Nazis forged British pounds and American dollars. Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called Superdollars because of their high quality and likeness to the real U.S. dollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of Euro banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than for the U.S. dollar.


=== Money laundering ===

Money laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets. However, in several legal and regulatory systems the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial crime, and sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing, tax evasion, and evading of international sanctions.

Ontotheology,"Ontotheology means the ontology of God and/or the theology of being. While the term was first used by Immanuel Kant, it has only come into broader philosophical parlance with the significance it took for Martin Heidegger's later thought. While, for Heidegger, the term is used to critique the whole tradition of 'Western metaphysics', much recent scholarship has sought to question whether 'ontotheology' developed at a certain point in the metaphysical tradition, with many seeking to equate the development of 'ontotheological' thinking with the development of modernity, and Duns Scotus often being cited as the first 'ontotheologian'.


== History and usage of the term ==


=== Kant ===
The term ""ontotheology"" was coined by Immanuel Kant in contradistinction to the term cosmotheology, ""in order to distinguish between two competing types of 'transcendental theology'."" The word's origin is often mistakenly attributed to Heidegger, who used it frequently.
At the broadest level Kant had distinguished two general types of theology: that which comes from reason and that of revelation. Within the category of reasoned theology he distinguished two further types, ""natural theology"" and ""transcendental theology"". Within natural theology, Kant differentiated between ""physico-theology"" and an ethical or moral theology.  Transcendental theology or reasoned-based theology, he divided into ontotheology and cosmotheology.
Ontotheology, according to Kant (as interpreted by Iain Thomson), ""was the type of transcendental theology characteristic of Anselm of Canterbury's ontological argument which believes it can know the existence of an original being [Urwesen], through mere concepts, without the help of any experience whatsoever"". Kant himself defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: ""Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology.""
Kant thus distinguishes between rationally-oriented (ontotheological) and empirically-oriented (cosmotheological) discussion.  Consistently with Kant's definition, philosophical and theological writers sometimes use the words ""ontotheology"" or ""ontotheological"" to refer to the metaphysical or theological views characteristic of many rationalist philosophers.  Heidegger, discussed below, later argued for a broader definition of the word ontotheology.


=== Heidegger ===
For Martin Heidegger, ontotheology took on quite a different meaning; for him, ontotheology is fundamentally the same as all metaphysics of presence. This he argues in Being and Time, his later essay on ""The End of Metaphysics"", in his Introduction of 1949 to his Was ist Metaphysik?, and in his most systematic treatment of the problem of ontotheology, Identity and Difference, (1957).
For Heidegger ontotheology contributes to the oblivion or forgetfulness of Being. Indeed, ""metaphysics is onto-theo-logy,"" and Western metaphysics ""since the beginning with the Greeks has eminently been both ontology and theology."" The problem with this intermixing of ontology and theology according to Heidegger's analysis, and the reason why Heidegger and his successors sought to overcome it, is at least twofold.
First, by linking the philosophical with the theological, and vice versa, the distinctiveness of each respective discourse is clouded over.  As such, the nature of philosophy as a factually unknown and structurally unknowable path of thought is restricted by an economy of faith.  Likewise with theology, as the science of faith, theology at its best testifies to the irreducible mystery of its source in revelation and to the unapproachable and incomprehensible aim of its desire in God. However, once theology becomes onto-theological that mysterious source and incomprehensible aim are reduced to the order of beings. Hence ontotheology is said to undermine both the philosophical and the theological projects.
Second, and more fundamentally, the ontotheological problem is one aspect of the degeneration of Western thought and the consequent troubles of Western technological culture. Ontotheology contributes to the human desire for mastery by presuming knowledge regarding the ""first cause"" of philosophy and the ""highest being"" of theology. The ""god of the philosophers"" in ontotheology, whom Heidegger referred to as the causa sui ('self-caused') or the ens realissimum ('ultimate reality'), is an idol created by human thought and used for man's own purposes. This is different from the ontotheological structure of the principle that Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz proposed. Heidegger cited that, in Leibniz's view, God, as the first existing cause of all being, is called reason and ""what is to be posited as the ultima ratio of Natura, as the furthest, highest - and that means the first - existing reason for the nature of things, is what one usually calls God."" 
Heidegger uses the expanded expression ""onto-theo-ego-logic"" (""onto-theo-ego-logisch"") in his lectures on Hegel in the Winter semester 1930/31 (GA 32:193).


=== Contemporary writers ===
Contemporary scholarship on ontotheology is divided between those who accept Heidegger’s analysis of the problem of ontotheology and continue his efforts at “overcoming ontotheology,” and those who are rethinking Heidegger's view and thus re-imagining the relationship between philosophy and theology and reconfiguring the conditions for philosophical theology.
The latter project takes its cue from Jacques Derrida's observation, ""With or without the word being, Heidegger wrote a theology with and without God.  He did what he said it would be necessary to avoid doing.  He said, wrote, and allowed to be written exactly what he said he wanted to avoid.""
Heidegger was careful to claim that his work was philosophical and not theological, and argued that a Christian philosophy or a phenomenological theology was an absurdity likened to a Protestant mathematics.  However, Heidegger's sustained and comprehensive critique or ""destructuring"" of the Western philosophical tradition has theological implications, as Derrida's reading of Heidegger's philosophy revealed.
Seen from this perspective ontotheology is not so much a problem to be overcome as an inevitability of thought that cannot be avoided and that conditions all human inquiry, whether theological or philosophical in nature, or whether religious or secular in orientation.  Yet Derrida claims in his essay Différance that différance both exceeds and inscribes ontotheology.
With regard to theology, a number of Christian theologians, such as Brian Ingraffia, Bruce Ellis Benson, Merold Westphal, and Jean-Luc Marion have argued that a genuine biblical theology of revelation escapes the problem of ontotheology by giving priority to a specifically theological language as disclosed through scripture and as passed down through tradition.  According to this perspective, the God of the Bible is fundamentally different from the God of philosophy, and thus, while the ontotheological problem sometimes eventuates in the pronouncement of the death of the moral-metaphysical God, this means little or nothing to the biblical portrait of the God of history who inspires and empowers the community of the faithful.
Thus many concepts have been considered to be the ultimate or absolute entity beneath all reality: Form, substance, essence, soul, geist or spirit/mind, extension, God, monads and can also be considered in some way as ontotheological in their reliance upon the metaphysics of presence.

One can delimit such a closure [of metaphysics] today only by soliciting the value of presence that Heidegger has shown to be the ontotheological determination of Being;...Derrida

Tourism 4.0,"The term Tourism 4.0 originates from the modern paradigm in industry, known as Industry 4.0 and aims to improve the added value to tourism through innovation, knowledge, technology and creativity. Therefore, the aim of Tourism 4.0 is to develop a model of collaboration that minimizes the negative impact of tourism, while at the same time improving the overall experience.


== Background ==
The Tourism 4.0 initiative was launched in 2017 by the Slovenian company Arctur after identifying the lack of readiness level to embrace the use of the key enabling technologies from Industry 4.0 (Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, etc.), especially by small and medium enterprises in the tourism sector. As a consequence, the Tourism 4.0 Partnership has been established to enable collaboration of any stakeholder in the world to participate in research or development of tourism of the future. Its aim is to boost the R&D spirit in tourism sector. It brings together a consortium of highly relevant industrial organizations, top research organizations in tourism, information technology and other sectors.

Tourism 4.0 builds on two fundamental ideas in which technology serves only as a mean. First idea is that the preservation of the quality of life of local residents, is in the center and all other stakeholder around them. Whatever solution is developed within this frame, should respect this. Second, tourism should build on data-driven strategic planning aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals with data collected on local level.


== Tourism 4.0 Ecosystem ==

The Collaboration Platform connects the T4.0 Core APIs with the technology pillars (TIM, FLOWS, CIT and DOTI) into a comprehensive business innovation ecosystem Tourism 4.0. Key enabling technologies from Industry 4.0 support transparent and secure data exchange between technology pillars and applications to co-create a new sustainable model of collaborative tourism.


=== Tourism Impact Model - TIM ===
The first pillar, Tourism Impact Model (TIM) is a tool that uses real data to create an objective picture of the impact of tourism in a certain micro-location. It analyses different societal aspects: from environment, economy and culture to collaboration. By modelling the impact with the use of different scenarios, it acts also as a digital twin of a tourist destination and allows data-driven strategic planning aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
TIM has been awarded as the Best Innovation in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics at the Tourism Innovation Summit 2020 in Spain and with Golden plaquette for best innovation of North Primorska by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia.


=== Tourist Flows ===
The second pillar supports tourist destination managers, service providers or researchers who want to better understand tourist flows: what impact traffic flows have, when occur traffic peaks, what are the seasonal effects, which areas are more / less congested with tourists, how the weather, holidays and other events affect.
FLOWS enable GDPR compliant advanced analyses and forecasts of tourist movements based on anonymised data from a multitude of different sources (traffic counters, data from mobile operators, freely accessible Wi-Fi networks, tourist tax, vignettes sold, water and energy consumption, waste, social media posts, etc.).


=== Collaboration Impact Token - CIT ===
Collaboration Impact Token is a digital voucher that changes its value according to location and time. It is an innovative tool that establishes a comprehensive system of rewarding and promoting the positive behaviour of all stakeholders of tourism ecosystem and improving the positive effects of tourism. CIT is based on a private blockchain network and cannot be traded. The obtained CIT tokens are stored by the user in the DOTI digital personal wallet, while part of the anonymised data related to transactions and the use of CIT is stored and processed in T4.0 Core.


=== Digital Online Tourist Identity - DOTI ===
DOTI is a personal digital passport that allows the individual (tourist) to maintain the ownership and full control of own data. Moreover, the DOTI mobile application is a secure space for storage of personal data and preferences and a tool for completely anonymous communication with tourist providers.


== Heritage+ ==
Heritage+ is a sub-programme of Tourism 4.0 programme, specialised in digital interpretation solution for cultural heritage field and GLAM field, often called ""digital innovation of cultural heritage"". Main activities within the sub-programme are creation of new enriched tourist experiences based on cultural heritage. It uses advanced technologies for digital capture (photogrammetry, laser scanning, 360° photo and video), simulated reconstruction (3D modelling) and presentation (Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Holographic projections, touch-screen) of cultural heritage, combined with hybrid skills of digital interpretation, digital storytelling, digital business model development, and strategic planning of digital transformation. Beside interpretation and presentation purposes, results are often used in research, documentation and conservation of cultural heritage.
Heritage+ works with both movable and immovable cultural heritage, combining them with audio and video materials and production on intangible cultural heritage. One of the main rationales behind the Heritage+ sub-programme is that digitally enriched cultural heritage can be a catalyst for quality of life and neighbourhoods, uniqueness of places, direct and indirect jobs in tourism, crafts, creative industries and commerce, source of tourist narratives and stories, creativity and innovation, it increases property value, stimulates education and learning, and creates a feeling of belonging and identity. In 2019, Heritage+ has initiated the development of ""T4.0 Technical guidelines: Digitisation of cultural heritage"" that represent the basic technical standards in the process of digitisation of cultural heritage and have been widely adopted in Slovenia.  In 2019, Heritage+ was awarded Silver Prize for Innovation at the annual ceremony by the Northern Primorska Chamber of Commerce and Industry.


== Research and development projects ==
Several national and international research and development projects related to the topic have been running since the launch of the Tourism 4.0 initiative.

Wallet,"A wallet is a small flat container, mostly of leather or fabric, that a person uses to hold cash, credit cards, identification cards, etc. Most men usually keep their wallets in their pockets, while women usually keep them in larger bags called purses.
Wallets, particularly in Europe, where larger coins are prevalent, contain also a coin purse compartments. Some wallets have built-in clasps or bands to keep them closed. 
As European banknotes, such as Euros and Pounds, are typically larger than American banknotes in size, they do not fit in some smaller American wallets.
A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, program, or service that stores public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function, a cryptocurrency wallet most often also offers provides encryption and/or the use of a digital signature.

File system,"A File system (or filesystem) is a way of storing all data on a data storage device. The data is usually organized in computer files in directories. Below the file system there is usually a physical device where the files are stored.  This might be a hard disk, USB flash drive, compact disc, or DVD. The file system might also talk to a remote server over a network where the file is stored. The file system might also only use RAM to store the files. 
The underlying storage mechanism usually has no concept of a file. A hard disk knows of disk blocks, which are numbered in a certain way. These disk blocks contain binary data (usually: large numbers). 
The file system does the translation between the large numbers, and the view the users see, that is that of files, organized in a certain way.
More recently, concepts from databases have been used to develop file systems. That way, there are two different kinds of data:

Data that holds the files
Data that is used to describe what state the files are in. This is called metadata.
It then becomes possible to always keep the file system in a consistent state. With databases, this is known as ACID. That way, an operation on a file is either done, or it is not done. There are however, no states in between. The file being written to the filesystem is no longer visible. This is usually done using transactions. But with filesystems, it is called journaling.

Collimated light,"Collimated light is light whose rays are parallel. This light spreads slowly as it travels. The word collimated is related to collinear, because all the rays in collimated light line up with each other.  
Perfectly collimated light would not spread out with distance at all. No real light is perfectly collimated. Real light will spread a little as it travels. Diffraction prevents anyone from creating a perfectly collimated beam. 
Light can be roughly collimated by using a collimator – a device which narrows a beam of particles or waves. 


== Etymology ==
The word ""collimate"" comes from the Latin verb collimare, which originated in a misreading of collineare, ""to direct in a straight line"".


== Sources ==


=== Lasers ===
Laser light from crystal and some gas lasers is highly collimated because it is formed in an optical cavity between two parallel mirrors, in addition to being coherent. The divergence of high-quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 milliradian, and can be much less for large-diameter beams. Laser diodes emit less collimated light due to their short cavity, and therefore higher collimation requires a collimating lens.


=== Synchrotron light ===
Synchrotron light is very collimated. It is produced by bending relativistic electrons around a circular track.


=== Distant sources ===
The light from stars (other than the Sun) can be considered collimated for almost any purpose, because they are so far away they have almost no angular size.


=== Lenses and mirrors ===

A perfect parabolic mirror will bring parallel rays to a focus at a single point. Conversely, a point source at the focus of a parabolic mirror will produce a beam of collimated light. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. Spherical mirrors are easier to make than parabolic mirrors and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light. Many types of lenses can also produce collimated light from point-like sources.

Art world,"The art world comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, preserving, promoting, chronicling, criticizing, buying and selling fine art. It is recognized that there are many art worlds, defined either by location or alternative definitions of fine art. Some may use the singular art world to refer only to the elite level of globalized fine art. The art world(s) are continually changing in response both to the creativity of those that create art and in response to social change.


== History ==
Rather than being a term coined in the 20th century, art world can be found in publications from the 19th century. The emergence of many of the elements, such as galleries, critics, and museums; as well as the term fine arts (Beaux Arts) date from the 18th century.


== Sociological definition ==
An art world, as with any segment of society, is defined in terms of mutually understood conventions (social norms, roles, and institutions) that are the basis for cooperative activity between members of a group who may not interact directly.: 46 
Howard S. Becker describes an art world as ""the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produces the kind of art works that art world is noted for."" Becker admits this definition is tautological, but is useful in understanding how works of art are produced and consumed.: xxiv 
Sarah Thornton, also a sociologist, describes the art  world as ""a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art"". They span the globe but cluster in art capitals such as New York City,  London, Los Angeles, and Berlin.


== Roles in the art world ==


=== Production ===

There are a number of roles for those actively involved in the creation of new works of fine art, but the exemplar remains the lone artist or a close collaboration. Historically, art was produced by the members of a workshop, often a master and a number of journeymen and apprentices. Contemporary artists allude to this group practice in their establishment of studio workshops or ""factories"", or by having works fabricated by industrial methods according to their plans and specifications.: 183–217  Some works, being of monumental scale, cannot be executed in any other way. In most of these group practices, the authenticity associated with fine art is maintained by the artist either doing the essential work, closely supervising others, and giving final approval to the finished piece by signing it.
Artwork by women was largely excluded from the highest levels of the art world until the feminist movement of the 1970s.
The primary socialization of individuals into the role of artists is by attendance at art school.: 46  The value of contemporary art depends upon the reputation of the artist, which most often begins with earning an MFA from a select number of art school programs.: 45–46  Some self-taught or outsider artists may gain recognition by being discovered by a dealer, while others are denied inclusion.


=== Distribution ===

The production of art depends upon its distribution to others in order to provide the economic support of that production. In the past, this was done through patronage or commissions from collectors. Artists may also do this themselves either by direct sales or through cooperative efforts. Contemporary art is most often distributed though intermediaries.: 93–107 
An art dealer is the intermediary between artists, private collectors and institutional buyers. While some dealers may be consultant advising individual clients, dealers usually own or operate art galleries. Hosting public exhibitions and opening celebrations became part of the social function of the art world in addition to their marketing functions.
The international art fair, occurring typically every two years, has become a major force in the marketing of contemporary fine art. Commercial art fairs are essentially temporary galleries that benefit from the attraction of public interest and competition between collectors. One of the most successful, Art Basel originated in Switzerland in the 1970s, expanded to Miami in 2000 and Hong Kong in 2010. Art Basel built on the model of Art Cologne, the first fair sponsored by and for commercial galleries; in contrast to the government sponsored world's fairs that began in the Victorian era. One of the latter, the Venice Biennale founded in 1895, continues to operate as a public foundation with national pavilions.
The tradition of auctioning works of art grew from the difficulty of determining the price of rare and unique objects. While estimates of market value are made for other purposes, such as taxation, charitable donations, and estates; in recent years prices paid at auctions have exceeded such estimates.


=== Evaluation ===


==== Art critics ====

In 1964 critic and philosopher Arthur Danto published an essay defining ""The Artworld,"" in terms of artistic theory. Danto writes: ""these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible"". In ""The Painted Word"" Tom Wolfe went further in saying that without a theory, the viewer cannot see a modern work of art. Theory is needed due to the absence of narrative meaning in abstract art that was once provided by realistic art. At the beginning of the 21st century, Danto stated that contemporary art does not speak for itself, but has meaning only in reference to art-world discourse.
Becker however notes that new theories of art may arise in order to account for the acceptance by the art world of works not fitting into older theories. An example is the failure of imitation theories, in which art was judged solely by it faithful representation of nature, to account for works which used form and color to express emotions, giving rise to formalism.: 145–146 
Danto had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and especially upon George Dickie's institutional theory of art. Dickie defines an art work as an artifact ""which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld).""


== Change ==
The notion of the singular art world is problematic, since Becker and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no ""center"" to the art world any more.
The art world, along with the definition of fine art, is constantly changing as works of art previously excluded move into the ""avant garde"" and then into mainstream culture.

Shorea,"Shorea is a genus of about 196 species of mainly rainforest trees in the family Dipterocarpaceae. The genus is named after Sir John Shore, the governor-general of the British East India Company, 1793–1798. The timber of trees of the genus is sold under the common names lauan, luan, lawaan, meranti, seraya, balau, bangkirai, and Philippine mahogany.


== Taxonomy ==
Shorea fossils (linked with the modern sal, S. robusta, which is still a dominant tree species in Indian forests) are known from as early as the Eocene of Gujarat, India. They are identifiable by the amber fossils formed by their dammar resin. Other fossils include a Miocene-aged fossilized fruit from the same region; this fruit most closely resembles the extant S. macroptera of the Malay Peninsula.


== Description ==
Shorea spp. are native to Southeast Asia, from northern India to Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In west Malesia and the Philippines, this genus dominates the skyline of the tropical forests. The tallest documented tropical angiosperm is a 100.8 m (331 ft) Shorea faguetiana found in the Danum Valley Conservation Area, in Sabah, Malaysia (Borneo). And in the Tawau Hills National Park, in Sabah on the island of Borneo at least five other species of the genus have been measured to be over 80 m tall: S. argentifolia, S. gibbosa, S. johorensis, S. smithiana, and S. superba. Borneo is also the hotspot of Shorea diversity with 138 species, of which 91 are endemic to the island.

== Reproductive biology ==
The majority of Shorea spp. are general flowering species, which is an event that occurs at irregular intervals of 3–10 yr, in which nearly all dipterocarp species together with species of other families bloom heavily. General flowering is thought to have evolved to satiate seed predators and/or to facilitate pollination. Both explanations apparently hold merit. Flowering is thought to be triggered by droughts that occur during transition periods from La Niña to El Niño. The magnitude of a flowering event is suggested to be dependent on the timing of the droughts associated with the El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) cycle, with the largest events occurring after an interval of several years with no flowering.
Shorea spp. are insect pollinated. A variety of insects have been identified as pollinators, with species within the sections of Shorea sharing the same insect pollinators. Flowering within a section is sequential within one habitat and species association to prevent competition for pollinators.
Seed predation and mortality have an impact on the reproduction process of dipterocarps such as Shorea. In Singapore, crab-eating macaque and moth larvae are known seed predators.


== Uses ==
Many economically important timber trees belong to Shorea. They are sold under various trade names including ""lauan"", ""lawaan"", ""meranti"", ""seraya"", ""balau"", ""bangkirai"", and ""Philippine mahogany"". (For a list of species associated with each name, see the article on Dipterocarp timber classification.) The ""Philippine mahogany"" sold in North America is not a true mahogany at all, but a mixture of woods from the genus Shorea.
Other products from Shorea spp. include dammar and illipe. Dammar is a resin collected from a variety of species. It varies in colour among the different taxonomic groups. Shorea wiesneri is listed in many websites as an important source of dammar; however, this appears to be either a trade name or a synonym.
Borneo tallow nut oil is extracted from the egg-shaped, winged fruit of Shorea species.

Of the 148 species of Shorea currently listed on the IUCN Redlist, most are listed as being critically endangered. Some concerns exist regarding the IUCN's listing of dipterocarps, as the criteria used to assess the level of threat are based mainly on animal population characteristics. This is thought to overstate the threat assessment, when applied to long-lived, habitat-specific organisms such as trees.  The Shorea species page gives threat classifications.

Adware,"Adware is an advertising computer program that can be put there by other people on someone's computer, sometimes without their permission. It is controversial because sometimes businesses put the program there so they can see what people are doing or what web pages they are browsing. They then put an advertisement that is of the same subject as the web-page the person is looking at. This can be good if the person is trying to buy something, but many people do not want advertisements. Many people also do not want other people to find out what they are doing or what web pages they are looking at. An example is in the popular peer-to-peer file sharing program, Kazaa. When someone downloads it, it installs adware on their computer that then sends advertisements to the computer. Some people do not like this so they use an illegally changed version of this program called Kazaa Lite.


== Removal tools ==
Removal tools have been developed to assist users in clearing out these unwanted programs.
Like many programs that people use for security, the program must be changed often. Updating allows the removal tool to recognize new types of adware. This can be done by downloading files over the internet using the 'update' option in the program.",0
Provenance,"Provenance is the history of ownership, or the position of a historical object. It comes from the French provenir, meaning ""to come from"".
The term was originally used in relation to works of art. It is now used in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, and science and computing. The main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery. This has a special value to help authenticate objects, to prove what they are. Provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.
In archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to provenance. Archaeological researchers use provenience to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, whereas provenance covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience or find spot is recorded (even videoed) with great precision, but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. An object may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). In some cases, especially where there is an inscription, the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground, as well as its history after rediscovery.

Radio Galaxy Zoo,"Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) is an internet crowdsourced citizen science project that seeks to locate supermassive black holes in distant galaxies. It is hosted by the web portal Zooniverse. The scientific team want to identify black hole/jet pairs and associate them with the host galaxies. Using a large number of classifications provided by citizen scientists they hope to build a more complete picture of black holes at various stages and their origin. It was initiated in 2010 by Ray Norris in collaboration with the Zooniverse team, and was driven by the need to cross-identify the millions of extragalactic radio sources that will be discovered by the forthcoming Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey.  RGZ is now led by scientists Julie Banfield and Ivy Wong. RGZ started operations on 17 December 2013, and ceased collecting new classifications on 1 May 2019.


== RGZ Data Sources ==

The project's scientific team are drawn mostly from Australia, with support from Zooniverse developers and other institutions. They use data taken by the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey which was observed at the Very Large Array between 1993 and 2011. Also used was data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS), taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in rural New South Wales. The infrared astronomy used was observed by Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Spitzer Space Telescope.


== RGZ Publications ==

RGZ has published five scientific studies (May 2018).
i) Radio Galaxy Zoo: host galaxies and radio morphologies derived from visual inspection. (November 2015)
The abstract begins: ""We present results from the first twelve months of operation of Radio Galaxy Zoo, which upon completion will enable visual inspection of over 170,000 radio sources to determine the host galaxy of the radio emission and the radio morphology."" It then explains that RGZ ""uses 1.4GHz radio images from both the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) in combination with mid-infrared images at 3.4μm from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and at 3.6μm from the Spitzer Space Telescope."" Its aims are that when complete, RGZ will measure the relative populations and properties of host galaxies; processes that might also provide an avenue for finding radio structures that are rare and extreme.
On the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) website, an article from September 2015 named ""Volunteer black hole hunters as good as the experts"" explains how citizen scientists are as good as professionals at RGZ's tasks. The research team tested trained citizen scientists and ten professional astronomers using a hundred images to help quantify the quality of the data gathered. As the initial results were published, facts and figures from RGZ became available. More than 1.2 million radio images have been looked at, which enabled 60,000 radio sources to be matched to their host galaxies: ""A feat that would have taken a single astronomer working 40 hours a week roughly 50 years to complete.""

ii) Radio Galaxy Zoo: discovery of a poor cluster through a giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy. (May 2016)
The abstract begins: ""We have discovered a previously unreported poor cluster of galaxies (RGZ-CL J0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy found in the Radio Galaxy Zoo project."" It continues to explain that the analysis of 2MASX J08231289+0333016's surrounding environment indicates that it is within a poor cluster. Radio morphology suggests that, firstly, ""the host galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with respect to an ambient medium like that of at least a poor cluster"" and secondly that ""the source may have had two ignition events of the active galactic nucleus with 10^7yrs in between."" These suggestions reinforce the idea that there is an association between RGZ J082312.9+033301 and the newly discovered poor cluster.
On The Conversation website in an article ""How citizen scientists discovered a giant cluster of galaxies"", Ray Norris writes about the above study. He explains that two Russian citizen scientists (CSs), Ivan Terentev and Tim Matorny, were participating in RGZ when they noticed something odd with one of the radio sources. It became clear that the radio source the two CSs had found ""was just one of a line of radio blobs that delineate a C-shaped “wide angle tail galaxy” (WATG)."" Lead scientist Julie Banfield explained that this was ""something that none of us had even thought would be possible.""
WATGs are rare objects that are formed when jets of electrons from black holes, usually seen to be straight, are bent into a C shape by intergalactic gas. This characteristic shape is ""a sure sign that there is intergalactic gas, signifying a cluster of galaxies, the largest known objects in the universe."" The WATG discovered by Terentev and Matorny is one of the largest known and has led to the cluster being named after them. ""This cluster, more than a billion light years away, contains at least 40 galaxies, marking an intersection of the sheets and filaments of the cosmic web that make up our universe."" Clusters, despite their importance, are hard to find but the use of WATGs might be a way of finding more: However WATGs are rare.
On the National Radio Astronomy Observatory website, Matorny and Terentev commented on their discovery. “I am still amazed and feel more motivated to look for stunning new radio galaxies,” Matorny said. Terentev added, “I got a chance to see the whole process of science … and I have been a part of it!”
iii) Radio Galaxy Zoo: A Search for Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies. (December 2017)
The abstract begins: ""Hybrid morphology radio sources are a rare type of radio galaxy that display different Fanaroff-Riley classes on opposite sides of their nuclei."" The authors explain that RGZ has enabled them to discover 25 new candidate hybrid morphology radio galaxies (HyMoRS). These HyMoRS are at distances between redshifts z=0.14 and 1.0. Nine of the host galaxies have previous spectra and include quasars and  a rare Green bean galaxy. It states: ""Although the origin of the hybrid morphology radio galaxies is still unclear, this type of radio source starts depicting itself as a rather diverse class."" The abstract ends:""While high angular resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm our candidates, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Radio Galaxy Zoo in the pre-selection of these sources from all-sky radio surveys, and report the reliability of citizen scientists in identifying and classifying complex radio sources.""
In an article on the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics CAASTRO website named ""Citizen scientists bag a bunch of 'two-faced' galaxies"", the author explains the findings of the above study. The lead scientist is Anna Kapinska with CS Ivan Terentev named second. Kapinska's team have been looking for rare types of galaxies named Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies (HyMoRS). These show galaxy characteristics that are combined, rather than distinct. The article states: ""Finding more HyMoRS helps us understand what kind of galaxy can turn out this way, and what gives them their unusual properties. Knowing that, in turn, helps us better understand how all galaxies evolve.""
The first recognised HyMoRS was discovered in 2002 and since then 30 more. RGZ near doubled the discoveries by adding 25 more. Galaxies with black holes that produce jets are often ""divided into two classes, Fanaroff-Riley I and Fanaroff-Riley II (or FR I and II). FR I galaxies have jets that fade away as they extend outwards, while FR II galaxies have jets that end in a bright, strongly-emitting region (a ‘hotspot’)."" Explanations include the behaviour of the central black hole, different densities of matter in the surrounding environment or simply illusions because of different distances.
iv) Radio Galaxy Zoo: Cosmological Alignment of Radio Sources (November 2017)

In November 2017, a team led by Omar Contigiani published a paper in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society studying the mutual alignment of radio sources. Using data drawn from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS), they investigate the most powerful radio sources, namely the largest elliptical galaxies emitting plasma-filled jets. The abstract begins: ""We study the mutual alignment of radio sources within two surveys, FIRST and TGSS. This is done by producing two position angle catalogues containing the preferential directions of respectively 30059 and 11674 extended sources distributed over more than 7000 and 17000 square degrees."" The FIRST sample sources were identified by participants in RGZ, while the TGSS sample was the result of an automated process. Marginal evidence of local alignment is found in the FIRST sample, which has a 2% probability of being by chance. This supports other recent research by scientists using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The abstract ends: ""The TGSS sample is found to be too sparsely populated to manifest a similar signal."" Results suggest that there is a relative alignment present at cosmological distances.
v) Radio Galaxy Zoo: Compact and extended radio source classification with deep learning (May 2018).
In May 2018, Lukic and team published a study in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society concerning machine learning techniques. The abstract begins: ""Machine learning techniques have been increasingly useful in astronomical applications over the last few years, for example in the morphological classification of galaxies.""


== Gems of the Galaxy Zoos (ZooGems) ==
During the next two years, up to 105 RGZ objects will be observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a result of Program 15445, whose P.I. is William Keel. The program's abstract begins: ""The classic Galaxy Zoo project and its successors have been rich sources of interesting astrophysics beyond their initial goals. Green Pea starbursts, AGN ionization echoes, dust in backlit spirals, AGN in pseudobulges, have all seen HST followup programs."" As a result of NASA 'gap fillers' initiative, it is hoped that significant scientific progress can be made by HST observations of a total of 304 objects, which have been chosen by voters using a Zooniverse custom-made interface. Keel stated: ""Each one of them might not be enough for an individual study, but when you put them all together it adds up to an interesting study.""

Death by burning,"Death by burning is an execution, murder, or suicide method involving combustion or exposure to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of public capital punishment, and many societies have employed it as a punishment for and warning against crimes such as treason, heresy, and witchcraft. The best-known execution of this type is burning at the stake, where the condemned is bound to a large wooden stake and a fire lit beneath. A holocaust is a religious animal sacrifice that is completely consumed by fire, also known as a burnt offering. The word derives from the ancient Greek holokaustos, the form of sacrifice in which the victim was reduced to ash, as distinguished from an animal sacrifice that resulted in a communal meal.


== Effects ==
In the process of being burned to death, a body experiences burns to tissue, changes in content and distribution of body fluid, fixation of tissue, and shrinkage (especially of the skin). Internal organs may be shrunken due to fluid loss. Shrinkage and contraction of the muscles may cause joints to flex and the body to adopt the ""pugilistic stance"" (boxer stance), with the elbows and knees flexed and the fists clenched. Shrinkage of the skin around the neck may be severe enough to strangle a victim. Fluid shifts, especially in the skull and in the hollow organs of the abdomen, can cause pseudo-hemorrhages in the form of heat hematomas. The organic matter of the body may be consumed as fuel by a fire. The cause of death is frequently determined by the respiratory tract, where edema or bleeding of mucous membranes and patchy or vesicular detachment of the mucosa may be indicative of inhalation of hot gases. Complete cremation is only achieved under extreme circumstances.
The amount of pain experienced is greatest at the beginning of the burning process before the flame burns the nerves, after which the skin does not hurt. Many victims die quickly from suffocation as hot gases damage the respiratory tract. Those who survive the burning frequently die within days as the lungs' alveoli fill with fluid and the victim dies of pulmonary edema. 


== Historical use ==


=== Antiquity ===


==== Ancient Near East ====


==== Old Babylonia ====
The 18th-century BCE law code promulgated by Babylonian King Hammurabi specifies several crimes in which death by burning was thought appropriate. Looters of houses on fire could be cast into the flames, and priestesses who abandoned cloisters and began frequenting inns and taverns could also be punished by being burnt alive. Furthermore, a man who began committing incest with his mother after the death of his father could be ordered to be burned alive.


==== Ancient Egypt ====
In Ancient Egypt, several incidents of burning alive perceived rebels are attested to. Senusret I (r. 1971–1926 BC) is said to have rounded up the rebels in campaign, and burnt them as human torches. Under the civil war flaring under Takelot II more than a thousand years later, the Crown Prince Osorkon showed no mercy, and burned several rebels alive. On the statute books, at least, women committing adultery might be burned to death. Jon Manchip White, however, did not think capital judicial punishments were often carried out, pointing to the fact that the pharaoh had to personally ratify each verdict. Professor Susan Redford speculates that after the harem conspiracy in which pharaoh Ramesses III was assassinated, the non-nobles who had participated in the plot were burned alive, because the Egyptians believed that without a physical body, one could not enter the afterlife. This would explain why Pentawere, the prince whose mother instigated the would-be coup, was most likely strangled or hanged himself; as a royal, he would have been spared this ultimate fate.


==== Assyria ====
In the Middle Assyrian period, paragraph 40 in a preserved law text concerns the obligatory unveiled face for the professional prostitute, and the concomitant punishment if she violated that by veiling herself (the way wives were to dress in public):

A prostitute shall not be veiled. Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her ... and bring her to the palace entrance. ... they shall pour hot pitch over her head.
For the Neo-Assyrians, mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience, but also as proof of their might. Neo-Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) was evidently proud enough of his executions that he committed them to monument as follows:I cut off their hands, I burned them with fire, a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up, men I impaled on stakes, the city I destroyed and devastated, I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps, the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned.


==== Hebraic tradition ====
In Genesis 38, Judah orders Tamar—the widow of his son, living in her father's household—to be burned when she is believed to have become pregnant via extramarital sexual relations. Tamar saves herself by proving that Judah is himself the father of her child. In the Book of Jubilees, the same story is told, with some differences. In Genesis, Judah is exercising his patriarchal power at a distance, whereas he and the relatives seem more actively involved in Tamar's impending execution.
In Hebraic law, death by burning was prescribed for ten forms of sexual crimes: the imputed crime of Tamar, namely that a married daughter of a priest commits adultery, and nine versions of relationships considered as incestuous, such as having sex with one's own daughter, or granddaughter, but also having sex with one's mother-in-law or with one's wife's daughter.
In the Mishnah, the following manner of burning the criminal is described:

The obligatory procedure for execution by burning: They immersed him in dung up to his knees, rolled a rough cloth into a soft one and wound it about his neck. One pulled it one way, one the other until he opened his mouth. Thereupon one ignites the (lead) wick and throws it in his mouth, and it descends to his bowels and sears his bowels.
That is, the person dies from being fed molten lead.


==== Ancient Rome ====

According to Christian legend, Roman authorities executed many of the early Christian martyrs by burning, including the warrior saint Theodore and Polycarp, the earliest recorded martyr. Sometimes Roman immolation was carried out using the tunica molesta, a flammable tunic:

... the Christian, stripped naked, was forced to put on a garment called the tunica molesta, made of papyrus, smeared on both sides with wax, and was then fastened to a high pole, from the top of which they continued to pour down burning pitch and lard, a spike fastened under the chin preventing the excruciated victim from turning the head to either side, so as to escape the liquid fire, until the whole body, and every part of it, was literally clad and cased in flame.
In 326, Constantine the Great promulgated a law that increased the penalties for parentally non-sanctioned ""abduction"" of their girls, and concomitant sexual intercourse/rape. The man would be burnt alive without the possibility of appeal, and the girl would receive the same treatment if she had participated willingly. Nurses who had corrupted their female wards and led them to sexual encounters would have molten lead poured down their throats. In the same year, Constantine also passed a law that said if a woman had sexual relations with her own slave, both would be subjected to capital punishment, the slave by burning (if the slave himself reported the offense—presumably having been raped—he was to be set free). In 390 AD, Emperor Theodosius issued an edict against male prostitutes and brothels offering such services; those found guilty should be burned alive.
In the 6th-century collection of the sayings and rulings of the pre-eminent jurists from earlier ages, the Digest, a number of crimes are regarded as punishable by death by burning. The 3rd-century jurist Ulpian said that enemies of the state and deserters to the enemy were to be burned alive. His rough contemporary, the juristical writer Callistratus, mentions that arsonists are typically burnt, as well as slaves who have conspired against the well-being of their masters (this last also, on occasion, being meted out to free persons of ""low rank""). The punishment of burning alive arsonists (and traitors) seems to have been particularly ancient; it was included in the Twelve Tables, a mid-5th-century BC law code, that is, about 700 years prior to the times of Ulpian and Callistratus.


==== Ritual child sacrifice in Carthage ====

Beginning in the early 3rd century BC, Greek and Roman writers commented on the purported institutionalized child sacrifice the North African Carthaginians are said to have performed in honour of the gods Baal Hammon and Tanit. The earliest writer, Cleitarchus, is among the most explicit. He says live infants were placed in the arms of a bronze statue, the statue's hands over a brazier, so that the infant slowly rolled into the fire. As it did so, the limbs of the infant contracted and the face was distorted into a sort of laughing grimace, hence called ""the act of laughing"". Other, later authors such as Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch say the throats of the infants were generally cut before they were placed in the statue's embrace In the vicinity of ancient Carthage, large scale graveyards containing the incinerated remains of infants, typically up to the age of 3, have been found; such graves are called ""tophets"". However, some scholars have argued that these findings are not evidence of systematic child sacrifice, and that estimated figures of ancient natural infant mortality (with cremation afterwards and reverent separate burial) might be the real historical basis behind the hostile reporting from non-Carthaginians. A late charge of the imputed sacrifice is found by the North African bishop Tertullian, who says that child sacrifices were still carried out, in secret, in the countryside at his time, 3rd century AD.


==== Celtic traditions ====

According to Julius Caesar, the ancient Celts practised the burning alive of humans in a number of settings. In Book 6, chapter 16, he writes of the Druidic sacrifice of criminals within huge wicker frames shaped as men:

Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offence, is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent.
Slightly later, in Book 6, chapter 19, Caesar also says the Celts perform, on the occasion of death of great men, the funeral sacrifice on the pyre of living slaves and dependents ascertained to have been ""beloved by them"". Earlier on, in Book 1, chapter 4, he relates of the conspiracy of the nobleman Orgetorix, charged by the Celts for having planned a coup d'état, for which the customary penalty would be burning to death. It is said Orgetorix committed suicide to avoid that fate.


==== Baltic ====
Throughout the 12th–14th centuries, a number of non-Christian peoples living around the Eastern Baltic Sea, such as Old Prussians and Lithuanians, were charged by Christian writers with performing human sacrifice. Pope Gregory IX issued a papal bull denouncing an alleged practice among the Prussians, that girls were dressed in fresh flowers and wreaths and were then burned alive as offerings to evil spirits.


=== Christian states ===


==== Eastern Roman Empire ====
Under 6th-century Emperor Justinian I, the death penalty had been decreed for impenitent Manicheans, but a specific punishment was not made explicit. By the 7th century, however, those found guilty of ""dualist heresy"" could risk being burned at the stake. Those found guilty of performing magical rites, and corrupting sacred objects in the process, might face death by burning, as evidenced in a 7th-century case. In the 10th century AD, the Byzantines instituted death by burning for parricides, i.e. those who had killed their own relatives, replacing the older punishment of poena cullei, the stuffing of the convict into a leather sack, along with a rooster, a viper, a dog and a monkey, and then throwing the sack into the sea.


==== Medieval Inquisition and the burning of heretics ====

The first recorded case of heretics being burnt in Western Europe in the Middle Ages occurred in 1022 at Orléans. Civil authorities burned persons judged to be heretics under the medieval Inquisition. Burning heretics had become customary practice in the latter half of the twelfth century in continental Europe, and death by burning became statutory punishment from the early 13th century. Death by burning for heretics was made positive law by Pedro II of Aragon in 1197. In 1224, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, made burning a legal alternative, and in 1238, it became the principal punishment in the Empire. In Sicily, the punishment was made law in 1231.
In England at the start of the 15th century, the teachings of John Wycliffe and the Lollards began to be seen as a threat to the establishment, and draconic punishments were enacted. In 1401, Parliament passed the De heretico comburendo act, which can be loosely translated as ""Regarding the burning of heretics."" Lollard persecution would continue for over a hundred years in England. The Fire and Faggot Parliament met in May 1414 at Grey Friars Priory in Leicester to lay out the notorious Suppression of Heresy Act 1414, enabling the burning of heretics by making the crime enforceable by the justices of the peace. John Oldcastle, a prominent Lollard leader, was not saved from the gallows by his old friend King Henry V. Oldcastle was hanged and his gallows burned in 1417. Jan Hus was burned at the stake after being accused at the Roman Catholic Council of Constance (1414–18) of heresy. The council also decreed that the remains of John Wycliffe, dead for 30 years, should be exhumed and burned. This posthumous execution was carried out in 1428.


==== Burnings of Jews ====

Several incidents are recorded of massacres on Jews from the 12th through 16th centuries in which they were burned alive, often on account of the blood libel. In 1171 in Blois, 51 Jews were burned alive (the entire adult community). In 1191, King Philip Augustus ordered around 100 Jews burnt alive. That Jews purportedly performed host desecration also led to mass burnings; In 1243 in Beelitz, the entire Jewish community was burnt alive, and in 1510 in Berlin, 26 Jews were burnt alive for the same crime. During the ""Black Death"" in the mid-14th century a spate of large-scale massacres occurred. One libel was that the Jews had poisoned the wells. In 1349, as panic grew along with the increasing death toll from the plague, general massacres, but also specifically mass burnings, began to occur. Six hundred Jews were burnt alive in Basel alone. A large mass burning occurred in Strasbourg, where several hundred Jews were burnt alive in what became known as the Strasbourg massacre.
A Jewish man, Johannes Pfefferkorn, met a particularly gruesome death in 1514 in Halle. He had been accused of having impersonated a priest for twenty years, performing host desecration, stealing Christian children to be tortured and killed by other Jews, poisoning 13 people and poisoning wells. He was lashed to a pillar in such a way that he could run about it. Then, a ring of glowing coal was made around him, and gradually pushed ever closer to him, until he was roasted to death.


==== Lepers' Plot of 1321 ====
Not only Jews could be victims of mass hysteria. The charge of well-poisoning was the basis for a large-scale hunt of lepers in 1321 France. In the spring of 1321, in Périgueux, people became convinced that the local lepers had poisoned the wells, causing ill-health among the normal populace. The lepers were rounded up and burned alive. The action against the lepers had repercussions throughout France, not least because King Philip V issued an order to arrest all lepers, those found guilty to be burnt alive. Jews became tangentially included as well; at Chinon alone, 160 Jews were burnt alive. All in all, around 5,000 lepers and Jews are recorded in one tradition to have been killed during the Lepers' Plot hysteria.
The charge of the lepers' plot was not wholly confined to France; extant records from England show that on Jersey the same year, at least one family of lepers was burnt alive for having poisoned others.


==== Spanish Inquisition ====

The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478, with the aim of preserving Catholic orthodoxy; some of its principal targets were ""Marranos"", formally converted Jews thought to have relapsed into Judaism, or the Moriscos, formally converted Muslims thought to have relapsed into Islam. The public executions of the Spanish Inquisition were called autos-da-fé; convicts were ""released"" (handed over) to secular authorities in order to be burnt.
Estimates of how many were executed on behest of the Spanish Inquisition have been offered from early on; historian Hernando del Pulgar (1436–c. 1492) estimated that 2,000 people were burned at the stake between 1478 and 1490. Estimates ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 burnt at the stake (alive or not) at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition during its 300 years of activity have previously been given and are still to be found in popular books.
In February 1481, in what is said to be the first auto-da-fé, six Marranos were burnt alive in Seville. In November 1481, 298 Marranos were burnt publicly at the same place, their property confiscated by the Church. Not all Marranos executed by being burnt at the stake seem to have been burnt alive. If the Jew confessed his heresy, the Church would show mercy, and he would be strangled prior to the burning. Autos-da-fé against Marranos extended beyond the Spanish heartland. In Sicily, in 1511–15, 79 were burnt at the stake, while from 1511 to 1560, 441 Marranos were condemned to be burned alive. In Spanish American colonies, autos-da-fé were held as well. In 1664, a man and his wife were burned alive in Río de la Plata, and in 1699, a Jew was burnt alive in Mexico City.
In 1535, five Moriscos were burned at the stake on Majorca; the images of a further four were also burnt in effigy, since the actual individuals had managed to flee. During the 1540s, some 232 Moriscos were paraded in autos-da-fé in Zaragoza; five of those were burnt at the stake. The claim that out of 917 Moriscos appearing in autos of the Inquisition in Granada between 1550 and 1595, just 20 were executed seems at odds with the English government's state papers which claim that, while at war with Spain, they received a report from Seville of 17 June 1593 that over 70 of the richest men of Granada were burnt. As late as 1728 as many as 45 Moriscos were recorded as having been burned for heresy. In the May 1691 ""bonfire of the Jews"", Rafael Valls, Rafael Benito Terongi and Catalina Terongi were burned alive.


==== Portuguese Inquisition at Goa ====
In 1560, the Portuguese Inquisition opened offices in the Indian colony Goa, known as Goa Inquisition. Its aim was to protect Catholic orthodoxy among new converts to Christianity, and retain its hold on the old, particularly against ""Judaizing"" deviancy. From the 17th century, Europeans were shocked at the tales of how brutal and extensive the activities of the Inquisition were. Modern scholars have established that some 4,046 individuals in the time 1560–1773 received some sort of punishment from the Portuguese Inquisition, of whom 121 persons were condemned to be burned alive; 57 actually suffered that fate, while the rest escaped it, and were burnt in effigy instead. For the Portuguese Inquisition in total, not just at Goa, modern estimates of persons actually executed on its behest is about 1,200, whether burnt alive or not.


==== ""Crimes against nature"" ====

From the 12th to the 18th centuries, various European authorities legislated (and held judicial proceedings) against sexual crimes such as sodomy or bestiality; often, the prescribed punishment was that of death by burning. Many scholars think that the first time death by burning appeared within explicit codes of law for the crime of sodomy was at the ecclesiastical 1120 Council of Nablus in the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. Here, if public repentance were done, the death penalty might be avoided. In Spain, the earliest records for executions for the crime of sodomy are from the 13th to 14th centuries, and it is noted there that the preferred mode of execution was death by burning. The Partidas of King Alfonso ""El Sabio"" condemned sodomites to be castrated and hung upside down to die from the bleeding, following the Old Testament phrase ""their blood shall be upon them"". At Geneva, the first recorded burning of sodomites occurred in 1555, and up to 1678, some two dozen met the same fate. In Venice, the first burning took place in 1492, and a monk was burnt as late as 1771. The last case in France where two men were condemned by court to be burned alive for engaging in consensual homosexual sex was in 1750 (although, it seems, they were actually strangled prior to being burned). The last case in France where a man was condemned to be burned for a murderous rape of a boy occurred in 1784.

Crackdowns and the public burning of a homosexual couple sometimes led others to flee out of fear of a similar fate. The traveller William Lithgow witnessed such a dynamic when he visited Malta in 1616 :The fifth day of my staying here, I saw a Spanish soldier and a Maltezen boy burnt in ashes, for the public profession of sodomy; and long before night, there were above an hundred bardassoes, whorish boys, that fled away to Sicily in a galliot, for fear of fire; but never one bugeron stirred, being few or none there free of it.
In 1409 and 1532 in Augsburg two pederasts were burned alive for their offenses.


==== Penal code of Charles V ====
In 1532, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V promulgated his penal code Constitutio Criminalis Carolina. A number of crimes were punishable with death by burning, such as coin forgery, arson, and sexual acts ""contrary to nature"". Also, those guilty of aggravated theft of sacred objects from a church could be condemned to be burnt alive. Only those found guilty of malevolent witchcraft could be punished by death by fire.


==== Witches and heretics ====

Burning was used during the witch-hunts of Europe, although hanging was the preferred style of execution in England and Wales. The penal code known as the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (1532) decreed that sorcery throughout the Holy Roman Empire should be treated as a criminal offence, and if it purported to inflict injury upon any person the witch was to be burnt at the stake. In 1572, Augustus, Elector of Saxony imposed the penalty of burning for witchcraft of every kind, including simple fortunetelling. From the latter half of the 18th century, the number of ""nine million witches burned in Europe"" has been bandied about in popular accounts and media, but has never had a following among specialist researchers. Today, based on meticulous study of trial records, ecclesiastical and inquisitorial registers and so on, as well as on the utilization of modern statistical methods, the specialist research community on witchcraft has reached an agreement for roughly 40,000–50,000 people executed for witchcraft in Europe in total, and by no means all of them executed by being burned alive. Furthermore, it is solidly established that the peak period of witch-hunts was the century 1550–1650, with a slow increase preceding it, from the 15th century onward, as well as a sharp drop following it, with ""witch-hunts"" having basically fizzled out by the first half of the 18th century.

Notable individuals executed by burning include Jacques de Molay (1314), Jan Hus (1415), Joan of Arc (1431), Girolamo Savonarola (1498), Patrick Hamilton (1528), John Frith (1533), William Tyndale (1536), Michael Servetus (1553), Giordano Bruno (1600), Urbain Grandier (1634), and Avvakum (1682). Anglican martyrs John Rogers, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley were burned at the stake in 1555. Thomas Cranmer followed the next year (1556).


==== Denmark ====
In Denmark, after the 1536 Reformation, Christian IV of Denmark (r. 1588–1648) encouraged the practice of burning witches, in particular by the law against witchcraft in 1617. In Jutland, the mainland part of Denmark, more than half the recorded cases of witchcraft in the 16th and 17th centuries occurred after 1617. Rough estimates says about a thousand persons were executed due to convictions for witchcraft in the 1500–1600s, but it is not wholly clear if all of the transgressors were burned to death.


==== England ====
Mary I ordered hundreds of Protestants burnt at the stake during her reign (1553–58) in what would be known as the ""Marian Persecutions"" earning her the epithet of ""Bloody"" Mary. Many of those executed by Mary are listed in Actes and Monuments, written by Foxe in 1563 and 1570.
Edward Wightman, a radical Anabaptist from Burton on Trent, who publicly denied the Trinity and the divinity of Christ was the last person burned at the stake for heresy in England in Lichfield, Staffordshire on 11 April 1612. Although cases can be found of burning heretics in the 16th and 17th centuries in England, that penalty for heretics was historically relatively new. It did not exist in 14th-century England, and when the bishops in England petitioned King Richard II to institute death by burning for heretics in 1397, he flatly refused, and no one was burnt for heresy during his reign. Just one year after his death, however, in 1401, William Sawtrey was burnt alive for heresy. Death by burning for heresy was formally abolished by Parliament during the reign of King Charles II in 1676.
The traditional punishment for women found guilty of treason was to be burned at the stake, where they did not need to be publicly displayed naked, whereas men were hanged, drawn and quartered. The jurist William Blackstone argued as follows for the different punishments for females and males:

For as the decency due to sex forbids the exposing and public mangling of their bodies, their sentence (which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the other) is to be drawn to the gallows and there be burned alive
However, as described in Camille Naish's ""Death Comes to the Maiden"", in practice, the woman's clothing would burn away at the beginning, and she would be left naked anyway. There were two types of treason: high treason, for crimes against the sovereign; and petty treason, for the murder of one's lawful superior, including that of a husband by his wife. Commenting on the 18th-century execution practice, Frank McLynn says that most convicts condemned to burning were not burnt alive, and that the executioners made sure the women were dead before consigning them to the flames.

The last person condemned to death for ""petty treason"" was Mary Bailey, whose body was burned in 1784. The last woman to be convicted for ""high treason"", and have her body burnt, in this case for the crime of coin forgery, was Catherine Murphy in 1789. The last case where a woman was actually burnt alive in England is that of Catherine Hayes in 1726, for the murder of her husband. In this case, one account says this happened because the executioner accidentally set fire to the pyre before he had hanged Hayes properly. The historian Rictor Norton has assembled a number of contemporary newspaper reports on the actual death of Mrs. Hayes, internally somewhat divergent. The following excerpt is one example: The fuel being placed round her, and lighted with a torch, she begg'd for the sake of Jesus, to be strangled first: whereupon the Executioner drew tight the halter, but the flame coming to his hand in the space of a second, he let it go, when she gave three dreadful shrieks; but the flames taking her on all sides, she was heard no more; and the Executioner throwing a piece of timber into the Fire, it broke her skull, when her brains came plentifully out; and in about an hour more she was entirely reduced to ashes.


==== Scotland ====
James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials. This special interest of the king resulted in the North Berwick witch trials, which led more than seventy people to be accused of witchcraft. James sailed in 1590 to Denmark to meet his betrothed, Anne of Denmark, who, ironically, is believed by some to have secretly converted to Roman Catholicism herself from Lutheranism around 1598, although historians are divided on whether she ever was received into the Roman Catholic faith.
The last to be executed as a witch in Scotland was Janet Horne in 1727, condemned to death for using her own daughter as a flying horse in order to travel. Horne was burnt alive in a tar barrel.


==== Ireland ====
Petronilla de Meath (c. 1300–1324) was the maidservant of Dame Alice Kyteler, a 14th-century Hiberno-Norman noblewoman. After the death of Kyteler's fourth husband, the widow was accused of practicing witchcraft and Petronilla of being her accomplice. Petronilla was tortured and forced to proclaim that she and Kyteler were guilty of witchcraft. Petronilla was then flogged and eventually burnt at the stake on 3 November 1324, in Kilkenny, Ireland. Hers was the first known case in the history of the British Isles of death by fire for the crime of heresy. Kyteler was charged by the Bishop of Ossory, Richard de Ledrede, with a wide slate of crimes, from sorcery and demonism to the murders of several husbands. She was accused of having illegally acquired her wealth through witchcraft, which accusations came principally from her stepchildren, the children of her late husbands by their previous marriages. The trial predated any formal witchcraft statute in Ireland, thus relying on ecclesiastical law (which treated witchcraft as heresy) rather than common law (which treated it as a felony). Under torture, Petronilla claimed she and her mistress applied a magical ointment to a wooden beam, which enabled both women to fly. She was then forced to proclaim publicly that Lady Alice and her followers were guilty of witchcraft. Some were convicted and whipped, but others, Petronilla included, were burnt at the stake. With the help of relatives, Alice Kyteler fled, taking with her Petronilla's daughter, Basilia.
In 1327 or 1328, Adam Duff O'Toole was burned at the stake in Dublin for heresy after branding Christian scripture a fable and denying the resurrection of Jesus.
The brothel madam Darkey Kelly was convicted of murdering shoemaker John Dowling in 1760 and burned at the stake in Dublin on 7 January 1761. Later legends claimed that she was a serial killer and/or witch.
In 1895, Bridget Cleary (née Boland), a County Tipperary woman, was burnt by her husband and others, the stated motive for the crime being the belief that the real Bridget had been abducted by fairies with a changeling left in her place. Her husband claimed to have slain only the changeling. The gruesome nature of the case prompted extensive press coverage. The trial was closely followed by newspapers in both Ireland and Britain. As one reviewer commented, nobody, with the possible exception of the presiding judge, thought it was an ordinary murder case.


==== Greece ====
The Greek War of Independence in the 1820s contained several instances of death by burning. When the Greeks in April 1821 captured a corvette near Hydra, the Greeks chose to roast to death the 57 Ottoman crew members. After the fall of Tripolitsa in September 1821, European officers were horrified to note that not only were Muslims suspected of hiding money being slowly roasted after having had their arms and legs cut off but also, in one instance, three Muslim children were roasted over a fire while their parents were forced to watch. On their part, the Ottomans committed many similar acts. In retaliation they gathered up Greeks in Constantinople, throwing several of them into huge ovens, baking them to death.


==== Last judicial burnings ====
According to the jurist Eduard Osenbrüggen, the last case he knew of where a person had been judicially burned alive on account of arson in Germany happened in 1804, in Hötzelsroda, close by Eisenach. The manner in which Johannes Thomas was executed on 13 July that year is described as follows: Some feet above t",1
Cold wave,"Cold waves are weather incidents that involve cooling of temperatures and air. Cold waves can cause death and injury for animals, people and livestock. Extreme winter cold causes freezing of water pipelines if they are poorly insulated. Motor vehicles often fail if the motor oil freezes or the antifreeze fails.
Examples of cold incidents in the United States are 1994, during January of which almost 70 percent of the country, along with southern Canada saw intense cold spells. The 2014 North American polar vortex created extremely cold temperatures across almost the whole United States and across Canada. The 2014 spell took close to two dozen human lives.

Dalbergia melanoxylon,"Dalbergia melanoxylon (African blackwood, grenadilla, or mpingo) in french  Granadille d'Afrique is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, native to seasonally dry regions of Africa from Senegal east to Eritrea, to southern regions of Tanzania to Mozambique and south to the north-eastern parts of South Africa. The tree is an important timber species in its native areas; it is used in the manufacture of musical instruments, sculptures vinyago in Swahili language and fine furnitures. Populations and genomic resources for genetic biodiversity maintenance in parts of its native range are threatened by overharvesting due to poor or absent conservation planning and by the species' low germination rates.
African blackwood is a small tree, reaching 4–15 m tall, with grey bark and spiny shoots. The leaves are deciduous in the dry season, alternate, 6–22 cm long, pinnately compound, with 6–9 alternately arranged leaflets. The flowers are white and produced in dense clusters. The fruit is a pod 3–7 cm long, containing one to two seeds. It is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world.


== Uses ==

The dense, lustrous wood ranges in colour from reddish to pure black. It is generally cut into small billets or logs with its sharply demarcated bright yellow-white sapwood left on to assist in the slow drying so as to prevent cracks developing. Good quality  ""A"" grade African blackwood commands high prices on the commercial timber market. The timber is used mainly because of its machinability, density, dimensional stability, and moisture repellence. Those properties are particularly valued when used in woodwind instruments, principally clarinets, oboes, transverse flutes, piccolos, recorders, Highland pipes, and Northumbrian pipes. The Deering Banjo Company uses blackwood (""grenadilla"") to construct the tone ring in its John Hartford-model banjo because it weighs less than brass or bronze tone rings, and that the wood ""plays in"" (improves in tone) with use. Furniture makers from ancient Egypt on have valued this timber. A story states that it has even been used as ballast in trading ships and that some enterprising Northumbrian pipe makers used old discarded blackwood ballast to great effect. The German knife companies Wüsthof, Böker and J. A. Henckels sell knives with blackwood handles due to the wood's moisture repellent qualities.
Due to overuse, the mpingo tree is severely threatened in Kenya and is needing attention in Tanzania and Mozambique.  The trees are being harvested at an unsustainable rate, partly because of illegal smuggling of the wood into Kenya, but also because the tree takes upwards of 60 years to mature.
African blackwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with sandalwood, pink ivory, agarwood and ebony.


=== Relation to other woods ===
African blackwood is no longer regarded as ebony, a name now reserved for a limited number of timbers yielded by the genus Diospyros; these are more of a matte appearance and are more brittle.
The genus Dalbergia yields other notable timbers, widely known as palisanders (true rosewoods), such as Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra), Dalbergia cearensis, cocobolo (Dalbergia retusa) and several others.


== Names ==
Other names by which the tree is known include babanus and grenadilla, which appear as loanwords in various local English dialects.


== Conservation ==
There are multiple organisations involved in the conservation of African blackwood: the Mpingo Conservation & Development Initiative, the African Blackwood Conservation Project, and Daraja Music Initiative (formerly Clarinets for Conservation).
The Mpingo Conservation & Development Initiative (MCDI, formerly the Mpingo Conservation Project) is involved in research, awareness raising and practical conservation of African blackwood. Conservation of mpingo and its natural habitat can be achieved by ensuring that local people living in mpingo harvesting areas receive a fair share of the revenue created, thus providing them with an incentive to manage the habitat in an environmentally friendly manner. In order to achieve this, the MCDI is helping communities to get Forest Stewardship Certification.
The African blackwood Conservation Project works around Mount Kilimanjaro replanting African blackwood trees, and in conservation education. It also works with adult and women's groups in the promotion of environmentally sound land uses.
Daraja Music Initiative (formerly Clarinets for Conservation) is a U.S.-based non-profit that aims to raise awareness and promote conservation of mpingo through music education in Tanzania. Students participate in an interdisciplinary program during the summer months that raises awareness of the value of mpingo through musical performances, classroom instruction, and tree plantings at local secondary and primary schools.
Small growers in Naples, Florida have been successful in growing African blackwood there. Growth habit in Florida yields taller, larger trees, and the rich soil combined with ample nutrients and long growing season yields timber of superior quality at more sustainable rates.

Luchina,"A luchina (Russian: Лучина) is a long thin sliver/chip or plate of wood, most commonly used as a miniature torch for makeshift lighting of the interiors of buildings in the history of Russia.  Similar implements were used in other countries, e.g., Poland (called pl:Łuczywo), Ukraine (called uk:Скіпка or Лучина).


== Luchina lights ==
An early mention of the use of luchina for lighting in western sources may be found in Fletcter's Of the Russe Common Wealth (1591):

...their greater menne vſe much waxe for their lightes, poorer and meaner ſorte birch dried in their ſtoaues, and cut into long ſliuers, which they call Luchineos.
Luchinas are best used from luchina cuts of log; it was steam-heated in a Russian stove for easy splintering. Splintering was done with the help of a special large knife called luchinnik. or kosar. It may also be done with a special implement, similar to a carpenter's plane. 
For lighting, luchina is inserted in a crack in the wooden wall or in a special holder called svetets. A small metal svetets may be stuck in a wooden wall. A more elaborate svetets may be manufactured with a stand. A small basin with water is usually placed under the svetets, to collect ashes and coals.
In Poland, luczywo, known under various regional names, could also be placed in a special cavity in the stove or on a special hearth attached to the stove, or in hanging holders.

In Polesian huts luchinas were burned using svitach (Світач, Polish:Świtacz), an implement that consisted of wooden pipe leading through the roof, under which an iron grate was hanging, on which luchinas were burned.
A part of servicing of luchina/luczywo, usually done by children, was to remove the charred tips, for brighter light.
Usage of luchina/luczywo had a number of drawbacks enumerated in an 1828 article by a colonel Piotr Kołogriwow, which suggested to use burning of hemp stalks for lighting. He identified the following issues:

Waste of big amounts of good wood (because bad wood (crooked or knotty) is not used for luchinas), because in winter nearly all dark time is used by peasants for various chores and winter works.
Fires, due to carelessness
Time spent for preparation of wood for luchina
Injuries during luchina splintering
Smoke in the house is bad for eyes and breathing.
Kołogriwow argues all the above drawbacks are absent if hemp were to be used.
Russian archeologists posed a question when luchinas were started to be used for lighting in Russia. Possible indicators would have been finding of luchina holders (svetets), but this indicator is unreliable for the determination of the earliest date, because luchinas can be simply inserted into a crack of a wall. Another way is search for lucina's unburned tinder ends (and having a reliable way to distinguish them from other kinds of partially burned pieces of wood). Archeologists of Novgorod sought for luchina ends in various strata and found no remnants of those in strata dated between the 11th and first half of 13th centuries.


== Other uses of luchina ==
Luchanas were commonly used as kindling to start a fire and for making laths for lath and plaster works.
In Olonets Governorate (Karelia), pine luchina was commonly used for basket weaving, both for home usage and for sale.

Mythical theology,"Mythical theology (theologica mythica) is one of three types of theology defined by the Roman scholar Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC) in his lost work Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum. The other two are political theology (theologia civilis) and natural theology (theologia naturalis).
Mythical theology is practiced by story-tellers, especially poets, based on narratives (mythoi) pertaining to divine matters. Divine revelation was claimed or implied by some of these story-tellers, or their disciples.
Theologians of civil or political theology are administrators, defining how the gods relate to daily life and the state (see imperial cult). Theologians of natural theology are philosophers, inquiring into the nature of the gods,
as evidenced by nature and reason.
""Mythical theology"" should be distinguished from the theologia mystica of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.

Synodic day,"A synodic day (or synodic rotation period or solar day) is the period for a celestial object to rotate once in relation to the star it is orbiting, and is the basis of solar time.
The synodic day is distinguished from the sidereal day, which is one complete rotation in relation to distant stars and is the basis of sidereal time.
In the case of a tidally locked planet, the same side always faces its parent star, and its synodic day is infinite.  Its sidereal day, however, is equal to its orbital period.


== Earth ==

Earth's synodic day is the time it takes for the Sun to pass over the same meridian (a line of longitude) on consecutive days, whereas a sidereal day is the time it takes for a given distant star to pass over a meridian on consecutive days.  For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a synodic day could be measured as the time taken for the Sun to move from exactly true south (i.e. its highest declination) on one day to exactly south again on the next day (or exactly true north in the Southern Hemisphere).

For Earth, the synodic day is not constant, and changes over the course of the year due to the eccentricity of Earth's orbit around the Sun and the axial tilt of the Earth. The longest and shortest synodic days' durations differ by about 51 seconds. The mean length, however, is 24 hours (with fluctuations on the order of milliseconds), and is the basis of solar time. The difference between the mean and apparent solar time is the equation of time, which can also be seen in Earth's analemma. Because of the variation in the length of the synodic day, the days with the longest and shortest period of daylight do not coincide with the solstices near the equator.
As viewed from Earth during the year, the Sun appears to slowly drift along an imaginary path coplanar with Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic, on a spherical background of seemingly fixed stars. Each synodic day, this gradual motion is a little less than 1° eastward (360° per 365.25 days), in a manner known as prograde motion.
Certain spacecraft orbits, Sun-synchronous orbits, have orbital periods that are a fraction of a synodic day. Combined with a nodal precession, this allows them to always pass over a location on Earth's surface at the same mean solar time.


== The Moon ==

Due to tidal locking with Earth, the Moon's synodic day (the lunar day or synodic rotation period) is the same as its synodic period with Earth and the Sun (the period of the lunar phases, the synodic lunar month, which is the month of the lunar calendar).


== Venus ==

Due to the slow retrograde rotational speed of Venus, its synodic rotation period of 117 Earth days is about half the length of its sidereal rotational period (sidereal day) and even its orbital period.


== Mercury ==

Due to Mercury's slow rotational speed and fast orbit around the Sun, its synodic rotation period of 176 Earth days is three times longer than its sidereal rotational period (sidereal day) and twice as long as its orbital period.

Dew point,"The dew point is the temperature where water vapor condenses into liquid water.
All air holds different amounts of water vapor. The dew point shows the amount of moisture in the air. The higher the dew point is, the higher the level of moisture in the air at a given temperature. The dew point of humid air will be higher than the dew point of dry air.
Condensation of water vapor starts when the temperature of air is lowered to its dew point and beyond. The dew point, like other measures of humidity, can be found from measurement taken by a hygrometer.

Celestial coordinate system,"A celestial coordinate system is a coordinate system that helps astronomers specify the location of objects in the sky. These objects may be stars, planets or even satellites. There are several such coordinate systems listed below. All of them are spherical.
The fundamental plane divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the equator in the geographic coordinate system. The poles are located at ±90° from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates.


== Coordinate systems ==
These are common coordinate systems used by the astronomical community:


=== Horizontal system ===
The horizontal system is based on the position of the observer on Earth. It is a useful coordinate system for finding and tracking objects for observers on Earth. It is based on the position of stars relative to an observer's true or ideal horizon.


=== Equatorial system ===
The equatorial coordinates are based on the position of stars relative to the Earth's equator. Imagine the Earth's equator extended out to an infinite distance. The equatorial describes the sky as seen from the solar system. Modern star maps almost exclusively use equatorial coordinates.


=== Eclyptic system ===
The fundamental plane is the plane of the Earth's orbit, also called the ecliptic plane. There are two versions: the geocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the Earth, and heliocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the centre of mass of the solar system.
The geocentric ecliptic system was the principal coordinate system for ancient astronomy and is still useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.
The heliocentric ecliptic system describes the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and centres on the barycenter of the solar system. This is very close to the centre of the Sun). The system is mainly used for computing the positions of planets and other solar system bodies, and their orbits.


=== Galactic system ===
The galactic coordinate system uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane. The solar system is still the centre of the coordinate system, and the zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactic centre. 'Galactic latitude' means, roughly, the elevation above the galactic plane. 'Galactic longitude' is the direction relative to the centre of the galaxy.


=== Supergalactic system ===
The supergalactic coordinate system is a fundamental plane with a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.

Apache Hadoop,"Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software tools, that speeds up the processing of very large amounts of data by distributing it to multiple computers.
Its core consists of:

a storage part: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This abstracts away the distributed nature of storage so that data can be moved around the cluster of computers more easily.
a processing part: Hadoop MapReduce (Hadoop's implementation of MapReduce). This is used to distribute and program transformations within the intended data processing pipeline.
Map: The Map phase organises data into key:value pairs according to a user's pre-defined mapping, and
Shuffle: a process called Shuffle uses those keys to sort and redistribute the data to nodes in the cluster so that similar data is stored together. This is known as Data Locality.
Reduce: The Reduce phase then does the transformation on the values, perhaps just a mathematical operation like addition, now taking advantage of Data Locality to streamline that processing at each node, like specialisation in economics. It then brings that data back together and finally writes it back to HDFS.

The distributed nature of Hadoop means that processing:

can be done in parallel rather than only sequentially, waiting for one step to finish before another begins.
is far more fault tolerant and so the processing has higher availability.

HDFS is also used for other projects such as the Apache NoSQL Wide Column Store, Apache HBase.

Reading and writing to and from disk for each transformation means that Hadoop MapReduce is slower for most pipelines than Apache Spark which uses RAM rather than disk and also runs within the Hadoop ecosystem. Spark may cost more in terms of resources such as memory and CPU.
Available to work alongside HDFS and Hadoop MapReduce are other Apache tools in the Hadoop ecosystem, such as:

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) which does the distributing.
Hive: a data warehousing tool which also translates your SQL queries into MapReduce or Spark jobs.
Pig, which make writing MapReduce programs easier than writing them in Python, C++ or Java directly.

As of 2013, Hadoop adoption had become widespread: more than half of the Fortune 50 companies used Hadoop.",0

        1.0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq \eta _{th}\leq 1.0.}
  

When expressed as a percentage, the thermal efficiency must be between 0% and 100%. Due to inefficiencies such as friction, heat loss, and other factors, thermal efficiencies are typically much less than 100%. For example, a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25% thermal efficiency, and a large coal-fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 36%. In a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching 60%.


== Heat engines ==
When transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy, the thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of energy that is transformed into work. Thermal efficiency is defined as

  
    
      
        
          η

    {\displaystyle \eta _{th}\equiv {\frac {W_{out}}{Q_{in}}}}
  
,
or via the first law of thermodynamics to substitute waste heat rejection for the work produced,

  
    
      
        
          η
          
            t
            h
          
        
        =
        1

                o
                u
                t
              
            
            
              Q

                n
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta _{th}=1-{\frac {Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}}}
  
.
For example, when 1000 joules of thermal energy is transformed into 300 joules of mechanical energy (with the remaining 700 joules dissipated as waste heat), the thermal efficiency is 30%.


== Energy conversion ==
For an energy conversion device like a boiler or furnace, the thermal efficiency is

  
    
      
        
          η
          
            t
            h
          
        
        ≡
        
          
            
              Q
              
                o
                u
                t
              
            
            
              Q
              
                i
                n
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta _{th}\equiv {\frac {Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}}}
  
.
So, for a boiler that produces 210 kW (or 700,000 BTU/h) output for each 300 kW (or 1,000,000 BTU/h) heat-equivalent input, its thermal efficiency is 210/300 = 0.70, or 70%. This means that the 30% of the energy is lost to the environment.
An electric resistance heater has a thermal efficiency of at or very near 100%, so, for example, 1500W of heat are produced for 1500W of electrical input.  When comparing heating units, such as a 100% efficient electric resistance heater to an 80% efficient natural gas-fueled furnace, energy prices must be compared to find the lower cost.


== Heat pumps and Refrigerators ==
Heat pumps, refrigerators, and air conditioners, for example, move heat, rather than convert it, so other measures are needed to describe their thermal performance. The common measures are the coefficient-of-performance (COP), energy-efficiency ratio (EER), and seasonal-energy-efficiency ratio (SEER).
The Efficiency of a Heat pump (HP) and Refrigerators (R)*:

== Energy efficiency ==
The 'thermal efficiency' is sometimes called the energy efficiency. In the United States, in everyday usage the SEER is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices, as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode. For energy-conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated, e.g., 'this furnace is 90% efficient', but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE).

Leakage effect,"In the study of tourism, the leakage is the way in which revenue generated by tourism is lost to other countries' economies. Leakage may be so significant in some developing countries that it partially neutralizes the money generated by tourism.


== Methods ==
Leakage occurs through seven different mechanisms. It is an intrinsic component of international tourism and thus is present in every country, to widely varying degrees.


=== Goods and services ===
Many countries must purchase goods and services to satisfy their visitors. This includes the cost of raw materials used to make tourism-related goods, such as souvenirs. For starting tourism industries, this is a significant problem, as some countries must import as much as 50% of tourism-related products.


=== Infrastructure ===
Some less economically developed countries do not have the domestic ability to build tourism-related infrastructure (hotels, airports, etc.). The cost of such infrastructure is then leaked out of the country.


=== Foreign factors of production ===
Smaller countries often require foreign investment to start their tourism industry. Thus, profits from tourism may be lost to foreign investors. In addition, travel agents outside of the destination country remove money from that market as well.


=== Promotional expenditures ===
Many countries spend considerable sums of money for advertisements and publicity. Maintaining a presence abroad may increase the volume of tourists to a country but also represent a considerable loss of money to foreign markets.


=== Transfer pricing ===
Many foreign companies manipulate their pricing to reduce taxes and other duties. In smaller or less developed countries, where many tourism-related companies may be foreign owned, this can represent a substantial loss of income.


=== Tax exemptions ===
Countries with a small tourism industry may have to give tax exemptions or other offers to increase foreign investment. While this may enlarge the tourism industry there, it must be taken into account as an instrument of income loss. This will lead to lost in income to the host nation as various tax exemptions are provided.


=== Foreign workers ===
Often foreign workers are employed in tourism and especially on a temporary base. These workers typically stay a couple of months in the country, they live on the premises and take all the salary home when they return home after their assignment. Depending the portion of this type of foreign workers it can represent a substantial loss of income.


== Application ==
A study of tourism 'leakage' in Thailand estimated that 70% of all money spent by tourists ended up leaving Thailand (via foreign-owned tour operators, airlines, hotels, imported drinks and food, etc.). Estimates for other Third World countries range from 80% in the Caribbean to 40% in India.
Leakage is not restricted to less-developed countries. Australia experiences a significant leakage effect from Japanese tourists. Though they spend the most per capita of all tourists to Australia, much of what they spend is through Japanese travel companies, Japanese hotels, and other foreign-owned businesses. There is thus significant leakage to Japan's economy.
Leakage not only varies from country to country, but also from industry to industry. High-income tourism may well significantly increase leakage, as that industry likely involves importing more goods and services than usual. Ecological or adventure tourism may exhibit a very small degree of leakage, however, as they place value solely on what the host country has to offer.


== Effect ==
As a result of the leakage effect, tourism industries in developed countries often are much more profitable per dollar received than tourism in smaller countries. Islands, in particular, suffer from significant leakage. In countries such as Turkey and the United Kingdom, the benefit to the economy from tourism is twice the dollar amount spent by tourists. In smaller places, such as Micronesia and Polynesia, that benefit is half the dollar amount spent. Some locations have managed to nullify the leakage effect almost entirely - New York City claims to generate seven dollars for the local economy per dollar spent by tourists. Some estimates of the degree of leakage claim only 5% of money spent on tourism remains in a developing country's economy.


== Reducing leakage ==
For many countries, some sources of leakage are unavoidable. Foreign-owned hotels and airlines are necessary for all but the most established of tourism industries. However, encouragement of domestic involvement in a country's tourism industry may reduce leakage in the long run. Currently, the most popular measure is restrictions on spending. Countries may limit the use of foreign currency within their borders, reducing the effect of transfer pricing (see above). Many countries require visitors to have a certain amount of money before entering, as well.

= Real-Time DSP Implementation Techniques =
Real-time digital signal processing (DSP) refers to the use of DSP algorithms that operate within strict time constraints, ensuring that input data is processed and output is delivered within a specified time frame. Real-time processing is critical in applications where low-latency responses are required, such as telecommunications, audio processing, radar systems, and embedded control systems.


== Challenges in Real-Time DSP ==
Real-time DSP systems must handle significant computational loads while ensuring that the output is produced within the required time. Some common challenges include:
Latency : The time between receiving an input and producing the corresponding output. Minimizing latency is crucial for real-time systems.
Throughput : The rate at which data is processed, which needs to be sufficiently high to meet the demands of real-time applications.

Resource Constraints : Real-time DSP implementations often run on embedded systems with limited computational power, memory, and energy.


== Key Techniques for Real-Time DSP Implementation ==

To address these challenges, various techniques have been developed to optimize DSP algorithms and hardware implementations for real-time performance.


== 1. Fixed-Point Arithmetic ==
Fixed-point arithmetic is often used in place of floating-point arithmetic in real-time DSP systems, especially in embedded systems. Fixed-point operations are computationally less expensive and faster, making them suitable for environments where processor resources are limited. However, care must be taken to manage the reduced precision and dynamic range associated with fixed-point operations.


=== To perform fixed-point arithmetic in digital signal processing (DSP): ===


==== 1.Choose a Fixed-Point Format ====
Define the word length (total number of bits) : Fixed-point arithmetic involves representing numbers with a fixed number of bits, typically including an integer part and a fractional part. 
Specify the number of fractional bits (Q-format): The fractional part is defined by a Q-format, such as **Q15** or **Q31**, which determines how many bits are allocated for the fractional part. For example, in Q15, 15 bits represent the fractional part, and 1 bit is for the integer part (or sign bit).


==== 2. Scaling the Input Data ====
Multiply the input values : Convert floating-point numbers to fixed-point by multiplying them by a scaling factor, which is usually 2fractional bits. For Q15 format, you multiply the floating-point number by 215.
Example: Convert 0.5 to Q15 format:
0.5 * 215 = 16384
     This result is the fixed-point representation of 0.5.


==== 3. Perform Arithmetic Operations ====
Addition and Subtraction : Fixed-point addition and subtraction are straightforward but require care in handling overflow. Since fixed-point numbers have limited range, ensure results stay within the representable range.
Multiplication : Multiply the two fixed-point numbers, and then shift the result right by the number of fractional bits to normalize it back to the fixed-point range.
     Example: Multiply two Q15 numbers:
                    Result = (A * B ) >> 15
Division : For division, the dividend is first shifted left by the number of fractional bits to avoid losing precision, then divided by the divisor.
                     Result = ( A << 15 ) / B


==== 4. Manage Overflow and Saturation ====
Since fixed-point numbers have a limited range, handle overflow by using saturation arithmetic, which limits the result to the maximum or minimum representable value instead of wrapping around like in standard integer arithmetic.


==== 5. Convert the Output Back to Floating-Point (if needed) ====
If needed, convert the fixed-point result back to floating-point by dividing it by the scaling factor. For Q15, this means dividing by 215.
Example of Fixed-Point Multiplication in Q15:
   Let's multiply 0.5 and 0.3 in Q15 format:
Convert to Q15:
     0.5 *215 = 16384,  0.3 * 215 = 9830
      Multiply and normalize:
     16384 *9830 = 161051520, Normalized result  = 161051520 / 215 = 4915 (Q15 fixed-point result)
Convert back to floating-point:
              4915 / 215  ≈ 0.15

Fixed-point arithmetic is commonly used in embedded DSP applications because it is more computationally efficient than floating-point arithmetic, especially on hardware with limited processing power.


== 2. DSP Processors and Hardware Acceleration ==
Many real-time DSP applications use specialized hardware, such as DSP processors, Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These platforms provide hardware-accelerated support for common DSP operations, such as convolution, filtering, and Fourier transforms, allowing them to meet real-time processing requirements more effectively than general-purpose processors.
DSP Processors: Devices like the Texas Instruments TMS320 family or Qualcomm Hexagon DSPs are designed to execute common DSP operations efficiently. They include specialized instruction sets, hardware multipliers, and parallel processing capabilities.
FPGAs and ASICs: For high-performance applications, FPGAs and ASICs can be programmed to execute DSP algorithms in parallel, providing significant speed-ups compared to software-based implementations.


== 3. Efficient Algorithm Design ==
Efficient algorithms are essential for real-time DSP. Some strategies include:


=== I) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) : ===
The FFT is a highly optimized version of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) that reduces computational complexity from (O(N²) to O(Nlog N). It is widely used in spectral analysis and filtering applications.


=== II) Polyphase Filters and Multirate Processing : ===
By using polyphase filters, real-time systems can efficiently process signals at different sampling rates. Multirate DSP reduces the amount of computation by exploiting different sampling rates for different parts of the signal processing pipeline.

Polyphase Filters and Multirate Processing are advanced techniques in DSP used to efficiently handle changes in signal sampling rates and implement filtering.


==== How to Perform Polyphase Filters and Multirate Processing ====
1. Design a Filter : Start with designing a digital FIR filter. This is typically done using standard DSP design methods to meet the desired frequency response.
2. Decompose into Polyphase Components :

Split the filter into several sub-filters, called polyphase components. If you are decimating (downsampling) the signal by a factor of M, divide the filter into M sub-filters. These sub-filters handle different segments of the input signal.
This reduces computational complexity since the filter doesn’t need to process the entire signal at once.
3. Decimation (Downsampling) :

Apply the polyphase filter to the signal and then downsample it by keeping only every Mth sample of the filtered signal. This avoids computing unnecessary output samples.
 In practice, this is performed by rearranging the order of filtering and decimation to be done simultaneously in the polyphase structure.
4. Interpolation (Upsampling) :

Start by inserting zeros between the input samples to increase the sampling rate by a factor of L.
Then, apply the polyphase structure to efficiently interpolate the signal using fewer computations than traditional filtering approaches.
5. Fractional Sample Rate Conversion :
   To convert the sample rate by a non-integer factor, first, interpolate the signal by a factor of L, then decimate by M. Polyphase filters make this process more efficient by simultaneously combining interpolation and decimation.
6. Efficiency in Multirate Systems :

Polyphase decomposition reduces the number of operations required in filtering when resampling a signal.
Multirate processing leverages this efficiency in systems where signals undergo varying sampling rates, such as in digital communication systems, audio processing, or image processing.


===== Benefits of Polyphase Filters and Multirate Processing =====
Computational Efficiency : By decomposing the filtering process, you reduce the number of redundant operations.
Flexibility : These techniques allow efficient sample rate conversion, making them ideal for real-time applications.


=== III) Block Processing : ===
Processing signals in blocks, rather than sample-by-sample, can reduce overhead and improve throughput, particularly in filtering and transform operations. Techniques like the Overlap-Add and Overlap-Save methods are commonly used in block-based filtering.


==== Performing Block Processing (Overlap-Add and Overlap-Save Methods) ====


===== 1. Overlap-Add Method (OLA) =====
The ""Overlap-Add"" method involves dividing the input signal into overlapping blocks, performing convolution on each block, and then adding the overlapping portions to form the final result.
Steps to Perform Overlap-Add Method :
1. Divide the Input Signal : Split the input signal x[n] into overlapping blocks of length N, where each block overlaps by  L-1  samples, where L is the length of the FIR filter h[n].
    Block size: N = L + M - 1, where M is the length of the input signal block.
2. Zero-Pad the Filter and Signal : Zero-pad each signal block and the filter h[n]  to size N .
3. Perform Convolution in Frequency Domain : Compute the convolution of each block with the filter using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is much faster than direct time-domain convolution.
4. Add Overlapping Portions : The resulting convolution blocks are overlapped and added together to form the final output.
Example:
Let the input signal x[n] be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and the filter h[n]  be [1, 1, 1]. 
Block the signal into overlapping segments: [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] , and [7, 8] .
Zero-pad each block and perform FFT-based convolution.
Add the overlapping results to form the final output.


===== 2. Overlap-Save Method (OLS) =====
The Overlap-Save method also divides the input signal into blocks, but instead of overlapping the results, it overlaps the input blocks and discards part of the output.
Steps to Perform Overlap-Save Method:
1. Divide the Input Signal with Overlap : Split the input signal into overlapping blocks, each block having N samples. The overlap between blocks is L-1, where L is the length of the FIR filter.
2. Perform FFT-Based Convolution : Zero-pad the blocks, perform convolution in the frequency domain using FFT, and then convert the result back to the time domain using IFFT.
3. Discard Overlapping Portions : Discard the first L-1 samples from each output block. These correspond to the ""wrap-around"" errors due to circular convolution.
4. Concatenate Results : The remaining M samples of each block are concatenated to form the final output.
Example:
Let the input signal x[n] be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and the filter h[n] be [1, 1, 1].
Split the signal into overlapping blocks: [1, 2, 3, 4] , [4, 5, 6, 7], and [7, 8].
Perform convolution using FFT and discard the first two samples of each block.
Concatenate the remaining portions to get the final output.


== 4. Memory Optimization ==
Efficient memory management is crucial in real-time DSP systems, particularly for large datasets or streaming data. Techniques such as circular buffers, which allow continuous streaming of data without requiring memory reallocation, are often employed to minimize memory access delays and optimize performance.


== 5. Low-Power Techniques ==
In real-time DSP systems, especially those deployed in battery-powered devices such as smartphones and IoT devices, power consumption is a major concern. Techniques to minimize power usage include:
Low-power design techniques in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems are crucial for battery-operated and embedded systems where power efficiency is a top priority. Here’s a guide on some common methods:


===== 1. Clock Gating =====
How it works: In DSP systems, not all components need to be active at the same time. Clock gating reduces power by turning off the clock signal to parts of the circuit that are not in use. This stops the components from switching unnecessarily, thus saving dynamic power.
Benefit: This technique helps reduce switching power, which is a significant portion of total power consumption in CMOS circuits.


===== 2. Voltage Scaling =====
How it works: Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) adjusts the supply voltage of the processor based on the computational load. Reducing the voltage lowers the power quadratically, as power consumption is proportional to the square of the supply voltage.
Benefit: By dynamically adjusting voltage, this technique achieves a significant reduction in both dynamic and leakage power.


===== 3. Power Gating =====
How it works: Power gating disconnects power to idle circuits by using power switches. This technique eliminates leakage power in inactive components.
Benefit: It’s particularly useful for reducing leakage current in sub-threshold circuits or during long idle periods.


== Applications of Real-Time DSP ==


=== 1. Audio and Speech Processing ===
Real-time DSP plays a pivotal role in audio processing tasks like hearing aids, noise-canceling headphones, and voice recognition systems:

Hearing Aids: Modern hearing aids use real-time DSP to filter out background noise while amplifying the frequencies important for speech. Algorithms like adaptive filtering and dynamic range compression are essential for enhancing speech clarity and ensuring low-latency audio for the user.
Noise-Canceling Headphones: These devices utilize DSP for real-time adaptive noise cancellation. The system detects ambient noise using external microphones, processes it, and generates an anti-phase signal to cancel the noise in real time.
Voice Recognition Systems: Whether used in smartphones, virtual assistants, or automated transcription services, DSP processes speech signals in real time, isolating key features like formants and harmonics. This ensures immediate recognition and interaction.


=== 2. Telecommunications ===
In mobile communication systems, real-time DSP is integral for signal processing:

Modulation and Demodulation: DSP helps in modulating (converting data to a format suitable for transmission) and demodulating (recovering the original data from the modulated signal) signals in real time, ensuring the transmission of voice, data, and video across wireless networks.
Noise Filtering: Real-time DSP filters out noise, such as interference and unwanted frequencies, in cellular systems, which is crucial for maintaining call clarity and data integrity.
Error Correction: DSP is responsible for real-time error correction through techniques like forward error correction (FEC). This ensures that even in noisy environments, transmitted signals can be accurately reconstructed at the receiver’s end without introducing significant latency.


=== 3. Control Systems ===
Real-time DSP is essential in embedded control systems used in sectors like automotive and industrial automation:

Automotive Systems: In applications like adaptive cruise control and anti-lock braking systems (ABS), DSP is used to process sensor data (e.g., speed, distance) in real time and generate appropriate control signals to adjust the vehicle's actions. The fast response is critical for safety.
Industrial Automation: For systems like robotic arms or manufacturing equipment, real-time DSP processes sensor inputs (such as position or force) and produces control signals instantly to ensure smooth, accurate operation.
Feedback Control Systems: In feedback systems, DSP processes real-time sensor data to adjust system parameters, ensuring stability, precision, and low-latency responses.

Cartoon violence,"Cartoon violence (or fantasy violence) is the representation of violent actions involving animated characters and situations. This may include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted. Animated violence is sometimes partitioned into comedic and non-comedic cartoon violence. Popular short films and television programs with cartoon violence include Rick and Morty, Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, The Simpsons, SpongeBob Squarepants, and Family Guy.


== History ==
Cartoon violence has a long history of being used to incite violence against minorities, beginning with the 1898 Wilmington, North Carolina newspaper cartoons.


== Influence on real-life behavior ==
Opinions on the influences of cartoon violence vary. Some researchers believe that high level of violence in cartoons can make children more aggressive. Their studies also found that young children tend to mimic the negative behavior they see on television. In a year, a child watching an average of 2 hours of cartoons a day will have seen 10,000 violent acts. Studies have shown that watching more cartoon violence is associated with higher levels of aggression among Taiwanese children. Cartoons targeted towards young children oftentimes have higher levels of violence compared to their adult counterparts. Researchers also concluded across the early and middle childhood, laboratory experiments using cartoons with comedic violence have consistently failed to demonstrate significant differences in reality-oriented aggression. In contrast, field experiments have consistently shown that aggressive behavior towards peers increases following the viewing of non-comedic violent cartoons. Depending on the type of cartoon, shows with cartoon violence could influence other behaviors in young children. An example of this is shown in a study where superhero cartoons were analyzed. A common theme emerged that police were not well equipped, and it is up to the heroes to take justice into their own hands. This raises concern that children may perceive this theme as the real world. It is important to note that cartoon violence has become more intense and frequent in the modern age  
However, some researchers propose that other factors contribute to the impact of violence on children. For instance, research from 2015 has suggested that cartoon violence does not have a direct impact on children.
Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz argue that children possess the ability to differentiate real life from animation, as well as the ability to understand right from wrong. They know that violent acts qualify as immoral and infringe on the welfare of others, therefore the violence witnessed in cartoons will register as ""make believe"" to children and will not be applied into their real lives. Children who were affected by harmful content are often excluded from the preceding discussions. Adults create idealized opinions for the general “child” instead of basing their beliefs over the feelings and experiences of a hurt child. Additionally, when trying to find how much influence a cartoon can have over the youth it is important to factor in outside influences. With technology improving the youth can now easily access the internet on a daily basis. Along with these technological improvements settings at home have changed, creating environments where often times children are left unmonitored. This adds further complications because it's hard to calculate what influencing the youth without knowing what they are consuming. 


== Options for parents and restriction ==
There are a number of ways parents can control their children's exposure to violence. One of the most effective and common ways of prevention is restricting the number and types of programs children watch. With older children, parents might want to discuss, and explain television. This can help children to understand television material and overcome the effect TV violence has on their outlook and behaviors.
With parents growing concern for how much violence was being shown in cartoons, some initiatives were put into place. The first is The Children's Television Act which requires broadcasters to air shows which are educational and provide information for the children. The second initiative is the V-chip legislation that gives parents the opportunity to block out violent shows from their television. The third legislation against violent cartoons is the National Cable Television Association's TV Parental Guidelines, which is a system that rates the Television shows based on their contents.
In action-adventure oriented cartoons, the most consistent avenue of addressing violence is the use of a form of fantasy violence in which no one is injured or killed on screen. In science fiction cartoons, for example, enemy forces are typically said to be robots so that they may be destroyed in bulk by the heroes without concern over killing living beings. In cases where vehicles are known to be piloted by living beings, tanks, aircraft, and other war vehicles that are destroyed in combat always allow time for the pilot to escape or bail out. Realistic firearms are often replaced with futuristic beam weapons which still seldom hit anyone. Swords and other bladed weapons may be prohibited from being used as offensive weapons but may be used defensively or be depicted as magical weapons. Guns are seen in 26% of violent incidents, specifically in cartoons based on real life. Direct violence is frequently limited to hand to hand combat where directly kicking or punching another character may or may not be allowed. The majority of action adventure cartoons over the past decades have used these methods of depicting dynamic action scenes although their use has been heavily criticized as ""sanitized violence"". This type of violence refers to when minimal to no physical harm is shown, as well as little attention is paid to the long-term effects. In rare circumstances where blood is shown it will be censored with different colors. Despite studies demonstrating that this television category has the most violence, many individuals do not consider sanitized cartoons to be violent. Cartoons based on the Voltron, Transformers, G.I. Joe, and Masters of the Universe franchises (especially the versions produced during the 1980s) are notable examples using variations on fantasy violence.
Earlier cartoons demonstrated that using violence was a successful method for capturing viewership. Contemporary animated shows have adopted this approach and simply elevated the levels of violence and graphic content.
Victor C. Strasburger, Amy B. Jordan and Edward Donnerstein, writing in Pediatrics, say that parents should limit the total screen time for children older than two years of age to no more than one to two hours per day. Children under two years of age should avoid watching television altogether. Televisions should be kept out of children's bedrooms and parents should watch television with their children and discuss the content. Saturday morning cartoons are considered the most popular time for children to witness violence on television because cartoons have more violence than comedies and dramas.
Health practitioners can also play their part by taking the time to ask their young patients how much time per day they spend with entertainment media and if there is a television or computer with Internet access in their bedroom. Six or more hours of TV viewing is linked to mild to severe depression levels.
Another option for parents is to be involved in what media their children are consuming. As mentioned in a previous paragraph, children's total screen time should be no more than two hours. This is two hours that a parent could use to not only monitor and bond with their child, but to also control what they are watching. Publishers Jiayu Li, Xiaoli Zhang, and Qian Du did a study on children with left-behind adolescents and the aggression they have. The study showed that nearly all who were struggling with this aggression had very little if not any relationship with their father. As for a mother's absence or lack of involvement in a child's life could also lead to higher levels of aggression. So, depending on whether or not cartoon violence leads to higher levels of aggression can be hard to determine with the lack of a parental figure.


== Effects ==

Effects of cartoon violence on youth remain controversial. Research has generally been divided on this issue with no consensus reached regarding the effects of violence on behavior. One such conclusion is gender does not play a crucial role to the research. An article published by Andrew J. Weaver and his team provides data showing boys do prefer to watch cartoon violence more than girls but they still both equally enjoy them. It is also mentioned that children might just have a natural likeness to watching violence. Huesmann 2007 claimed watching violent cartoons can make young children more aggressive. Steuer, Applefield and Smith claim children emulate cartoon characters' activities, even when they aren't depicted as being human. Bandura, Ross, and Ross 1963 point out that what might seem clearly fictional to an adult might seem real to young children. Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz claim the impact of exposure to violence may remain regardless of whether children choose to imitate it. This impact can be harmful to a child if that form of violence was an on-screen character death. With present day cartoons having an increased rate of on-screen death, if a child is not emotionally prepared this can lead to many harmful effects. But if the subject of death is handled correctly, this can give children an early positive understanding of death.

Lyptus,"Lyptus is the trade name of a wood made from a hybrid of two species of Eucalyptus tree, Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla. Developed for quick harvesting, and grown on plantations in Brazil, Lyptus is marketed as an environmentally friendly alternative to oak, cherry, mahogany, and other wood products that may be harvested from old growth forests. Lyptus trees can be harvested for lumber in approximately 15 years, much sooner than woods from cooler climates.
Lyptus is grown in plantations operated by Fibria, a company resulting from the merger of Aracruz Celulose S.A. and Votorantim Celulose e Papel. Lyptus is distributed in North America by Weyerhaeuser. Fibria forests total 1.3 million hectares, of which 461,000 hectares are native reserves dedicated to environmental protection, in six Brazilian States: Espírito Santo, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul.


== Properties ==
Lyptus has mechanical properties similar to many hardwoods, and is most often compared to maple. It is a closed-grain wood, and is harder than oak. The high hardness and closed grain structure make it popular for cabinetry, millwork and flooring. The coloration varies from a light salmon to a deeper red. With exposure to UV light, the pigments darken slightly.


== Workability ==
Lyptus is largely marketed as a viable alternative to mahogany. The density and closed, uniform grain structure of Lyptus lends well to both milling and machining. It doesn't produce the ""fuzzy"" raised grain when sawed that mahogany frequently does, and unlike maple, it doesn't have spots of knurled grain that would make it prone to tearout.


== Benefits ==
As a plantation grown wood, use of Lyptus does not deplete old growth forests, which are regarded as valuable havens for biodiversity. Lyptus's fast growth rate ensures that supply stays high, and keeps costs low. The plantation environment also allows for precise control of soil chemistry, tree spacing, and other factors affecting growth, resulting in the highest quantity of quality wood from the smallest space.


== Criticism ==
Aracruz has been criticized in the past for poor relations with indigenous peoples, by strongly supporting legal measures that would give Aracruz land previously designated for indigenous tribes. Aracruz has refused to certify their process with the Forest Stewardship Council and related forestry certification programs. Aracruz claims that they do not certify with current programs because they are too limiting, and do not represent realistic practices. However, others feel that their lack of certification is a sign that they are engaging in processes that may not be environmentally friendly.
Fibria closed the Lyptus sawmill in October 2017.

Blessing,"A blessing is way to wish good luck for a person. Sometimes, in religious rituals, it is said the God blesses those who are good, or people can bless God with anointing. In Judaism, they bless God over wine. The priests can also bless religious objects in order to make them become holy.
The saying ""bless you"" is commonly used when someone sneezes. This is done because there is a tradition carried by the superstition that a person's soul will come out of their mouth and nose if they sneeze. People believed that saying ""God bless you,"" or ""bless you"" for short, would make the soul go back inside. They are wishing the person good luck so that their soul is able to come back. 
People also think that if unusual good luck or a miracle comes to them, it is a blessing. For example, if some people wanted a child badly but are having difficulty conceiving, it could be considered a blessing from God if they end up having a child.
To give your blessing to someone is to give permission to them. For example, a man can ask his girlfriend's parents' for their blessing before he asks her to marry him.
Blessings are often thought of as the opposite of a curse.

Conservation and restoration of plastic objects,"Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics is work dedicated to the conservation of objects of historical and personal value made from plastics. When applied to cultural heritage, this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer.


== Background ==
Within museum collections, there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of organic plastic materials, either synthetic or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life, and many plastic artifacts have become cultural icons or objects worth preserving for the future.  Although relatively new materials for museum collections, having originated in the 19th century, plastics are deteriorating at an alarming rate. This risks the loss not only of the objects themselves, but other nearby materials may also be degraded by outgassing or reactions with other released chemicals.


== Identification of plastics ==

Identification of plastic components of a collection is extremely important, because some plastics may release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects. A preservation plan can be established to slow down the effects and protect a collection.
Plastics are identified by various methods, including trade name, trademark, or patent number. Depending on the manufacturer, different chemical formulas and materials may have been used to produce the plastic over the years. A recycling code may be present, giving general information about the material composition. Plastic composites or proprietary blends can be more difficult to identify.
If there are no markings to identify the type of plastic used, it may still be identified by using various types of spectroscopic technology such as optical spectrometer, Raman mid-infrared spectroscopy, and near-infrared spectroscopy, along with mass spectrometry. Other forms of identification include elemental analysis or thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics.
The Museum of Design in Plastics (MoDiP), has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the manufacturing dates and manufacturing processes, along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell. If an object in a collection has characteristics that differ from what is expected, it is possible that the piece has begun to deteriorate.
In 2022, the Getty Conservation Institute published a book on the properties of commonly-used plastics and elastomers, including 56 ""fact sheets"" summarizing important characteristics of the materials, and methods of identification.


== Common plastics ==
The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections. These are some plastics that may degrade, but are not seriously harmful to nearby objects: 

Non-plasticized (rigid) polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
The following are ""malignant"" plastic materials that will age rapidly if left untreated, and which have a higher risk of off-gassing or releasing toxic materials that can damage surrounding objects:

Polyvinyl chloride treated with plasticizers
Polyurethane
Cellulose esters, including cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate
Vulcanized rubber
Biodegradable plastics
Environmental concerns have driven recent changes in plastic manufacturing towards biodegradable plastics, with a potentially negative effect upon the long-term stability of such materials within museum collections.


== Deterioration ==

A difficult aspect of plastic deterioration is that one cannot see what types of chemical reactions are occurring in the interior of an object, or easily identify the makeup of proprietary plastic composites. Many plastics will give off a distinct odor, ooze liquids, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way as they age. Although deterioration cannot always be stopped, it is important to know the causes and be able to mitigate or slow damage.


=== Causes ===
The causes of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects:

Age – When plastics were first manufactured in the 19th century, they were derived directly from organic materials; over the years these objects have usually deteriorated due to lack of knowledge and improper handling of the early plastics.
Chemical – Depending on an object's chemical composition, conservators can understand how it will react over time. Other chemical reactions are driven by heat, oxygen, light, liquids, additives, and biological attacks.
Storage – Improper storage of plastic artifacts can allow contamination and deterioration to occur. This often occurs when temperature or relative humidity fluctuate in the storage area, and this may cause the polymers to react to the environment, to deteriorate, and possibly to contaminate surrounding objects. Maintaining stable storage conditions is also important when an object is on exhibit. When the object is lighted and on display, its temperature and humidity can fluctuate. Conditions inside the exhibit case must be monitored and adjusted when necessary, to help prevent any damage.
Improper handling – Improper cleaning techniques when using water or solvents on incompatible materials can cause damage. Also, human error when handling objects can occur, causing abrasions or scratches.


=== Chemical processes ===
Understanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation helps in planning specific measures to protect plastic artifacts. Listed below are types of chemical reactions that accelerate the deterioration of the polymer's structure:

Photo-oxidative degradation occurs when plastic degrades from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) or visible light; the most damaging wavelengths depend on the composition of the polymer. In general, plastic will be affected by light, and it is best practice to keep plastic away from light sources as much as possible, especially during longterm storage.
Thermal degradation affects the entire bulk volume of the polymer making up an object, and is strongly affected by the temperature and amount of light exposure.
Ozone-induced degradation will deteriorate saturated and unsaturated polymers when the plastic is exposed to atmospheric ozone. A test can be conducted to see if the object has been exposed, by taking small samples for analysis using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
Catalytic degradation mainly focuses on plastic waste polymers as they are transformed into hydrocarbons.
Biodegradation causes the surface or the strength of the plastic to change; this process eventually decomposes vulnerable materials into carbon dioxide and water as microbes consume components of the material.
Hydroperoxide decomposition occurs when metal and metal ions within the plastic material lead to the deterioration of the object
Plasticizer migration occurs when additive chemicals intended to keep a plastic resin soft and pliable gradually move to the surface or are shed from an object. The loss of these chemicals causes the plastic to revert to a brittle state, often shrinking or distorting in shape. The migrating chemicals may cause other nearby objects to deform or otherwise degrade. In addition, many plasticizers, such as phthalates or bisphenol A (BPA) may be toxic, hormone disruptors, or carcinogenic in their biological effects.

Additional effects of deterioration:
Plastics composed of cellulose acetate, when exposed to water, often will give off a smell of vinegar (vinegar syndrome); the surface will have a white powder residue and will begin to shrink.
Cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and cellulose butyrate will produce butyric acid which has a ""vomit odor"".
Polyvinyl chloride may cause a ""blooming"" effect, white powder on the surface that can contaminate nearby materials.


== Preventive care ==
A yearly checkup of plastic artifacts can help monitor their condition, as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to verify that they have not been cross-contaminated.


=== Safe handling ===
Impermeable safety gloves such as those made of nitrile can help prevent toxins from entering the skin when handling plastic objects. Dust masks, respirators, or other personal protective equipment may be required for protection from outgassing or airborne microplastic dusts produced by some decaying plastics.


=== Storage environment ===
Plastics are best stored with a relative humidity level of 50%, at a storage temperature of 18 °C (64 °F), in light-proof enclosures. Because the composition of each plastic material can be different, it is difficult to designate a single uniform storage care plan; understanding the specific composition of a plastic artifact can help determine its preferred climate conditions. Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature and placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen-impermeable bags helps to slow degradation.
Monitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by tracking their status and condition by using log entries on spreadsheets or in another database. Monitoring the temperature environment is done using data logger hardware which tracks hourly changes in temperature (and optionally, humidity). Objects composed of flammable and unstable cellulose nitrate especially benefit from cold storage, to reduce their rate of decay.


=== Long-term storage supplies ===
Adsorbents such as activated carbon, silica gel, and zeolites are used to absorb gases that are released from plastics. These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, whether the object is on exhibit or in long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes can help slow down the process of degradation and vinegar syndrome which is common in certain types of film, Lego plastics, and artwork. 
Oxygen-impermeable bags are used to exclude atmospheric oxygen. In combination with oxygen absorbers, this prevents oxidation and deterioration of the contents.


== Conservation ==
The process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of chemical composition of the material and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoration and their limitations, as well as development of a post-treatment preventive care plan for the object.


=== Cleaning ===
The process of cleaning plastics is done with the use of appropriate solvents, after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. A spot test can be performed if there is uncertainty how the object will react to water or solvents.


=== Scratch removal ===
Within the field of contemporary art, where the surface finish is part of the artist's intent, the removal of scratches may need to be more nuanced, compared to simply compensating for accidental damage to social-historical artifacts. Conservators have developed and scientifically investigated a variety of methods for scratch removal.


=== Filling ===
Fillings may be needed if an object has suffered considerable loss of material due to accidental damage or chemical deterioration. The process of filling depends on the object's chemical composition, and requires consideration of refractive indexes, transparency, viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.

Smoke,"Smoke is a suspension of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes. It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative.

Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products.
Smoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.


== Chemical composition ==
The composition of smoke depends on the nature of the burning fuel and the conditions of combustion. Fires with high availability of oxygen burn at a high temperature and with a small amount of smoke produced; the particles are mostly composed of ash, or with large temperature differences, of condensed aerosol of water. High temperature also leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur content yields sulfur dioxide, or in case of incomplete combustion, hydrogen sulfide. Carbon and hydrogen are almost completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Fires burning with lack of oxygen produce a significantly wider palette of compounds, many of them toxic. Partial oxidation of carbon produces carbon monoxide, while nitrogen-containing materials can yield hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen gas can be produced instead of water. Contents of halogens such as chlorine (e.g. in polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants) may lead to the production of hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, and chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons. Hydrogen fluoride can be formed from fluorocarbons, whether fluoropolymers subjected to fire or halocarbon fire suppression agents. Phosphorus and antimony oxides and their reaction products can be formed from some fire retardant additives, increasing smoke toxicity and corrosivity. Pyrolysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), e.g. from burning older transformer oil, and to lower degree also of other chlorine-containing materials, can produce 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. Pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, e.g. teflon, in presence of oxygen yields carbonyl fluoride (which hydrolyzes readily to HF and CO2); other compounds may be formed as well, e.g. carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and highly toxic perfluoroisobutene (PFIB).

Pyrolysis of burning material, especially incomplete combustion or smoldering without adequate oxygen supply, also results in production of a large amount of hydrocarbons, both aliphatic (methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene) and aromatic (benzene and its derivates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; e.g. benzo[a]pyrene, studied as a carcinogen, or retene), terpenes. It also results in the emission of a range of smaller oxygenated volatile organic compounds (methanol, acetic acid, hydroxy acetone, methyl acetate and ethyl formate) which are formed as combustion by products as well as less volatile oxygenated organic species such as phenolics, furans and furanones. Heterocyclic compounds may be also present. Heavier hydrocarbons may condense as tar; smoke with significant tar content is yellow to brown. Combustion of solid fuels can result in the emission of many hundreds to thousands of lower volatility organic compounds in the aerosol phase. Presence of such smoke, soot, and/or brown oily deposits during a fire indicates a possible hazardous situation, as the atmosphere may be saturated with combustible pyrolysis products with concentration above the upper flammability limit, and sudden inrush of air can cause flashover or backdraft.
Presence of sulfur can lead to formation of gases like hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon disulfide, and thiols; especially thiols tend to get adsorbed on surfaces and produce a lingering odor even long after the fire. Partial oxidation of the released hydrocarbons yields in a wide palette of other compounds: aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde, acrolein, and furfural), ketones, alcohols (often aromatic, e.g. phenol, guaiacol, syringol, catechol, and cresols), carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, etc.).
The visible particulate matter in such smokes is most commonly composed of carbon (soot). Other particulates may be composed of drops of condensed tar, or solid particles of ash. The presence of metals in the fuel yields particles of metal oxides. Particles of inorganic salts may also be formed, e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or sodium chloride. Inorganic salts present on the surface of the soot particles may make them hydrophilic. Many organic compounds, typically the aromatic hydrocarbons, may be also adsorbed on the surface of the solid particles. Metal oxides can be present when metal-containing fuels are burned, e.g. solid rocket fuels containing aluminium. Depleted uranium projectiles after impacting the target ignite, producing particles of uranium oxides. Magnetic particles, spherules of magnetite-like ferrous ferric oxide, are present in coal smoke; their increase in deposits after 1860 marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. (Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be also produced in the smoke from meteorites burning in the atmosphere.) Magnetic remanence, recorded in the iron oxide particles, indicates the strength of Earth's magnetic field when they were cooled beyond their Curie temperature; this can be used to distinguish magnetic particles of terrestrial and meteoric origin. Fly ash is composed mainly of silica and calcium oxide. Cenospheres are present in smoke from liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Minute metal particles produced by abrasion can be present in engine smokes. Amorphous silica particles are present in smokes from burning silicones; small proportion of silicon nitride particles can be formed in fires with insufficient oxygen. The silica particles have about 10 nm size, clumped to 70–100 nm aggregates and further agglomerated to chains. Radioactive particles may be present due to traces of uranium, thorium, or other radionuclides in the fuel; hot particles can be present in case of fires during nuclear accidents (e.g. Chernobyl disaster) or nuclear war.
Smoke particulates, like other aerosols, are categorized into three modes based on particle size:

nuclei mode, with geometric mean radius between 2.5 and 20 nm, likely forming by condensation of carbon moieties.
accumulation mode, ranging between 75 and 250 nm and formed by coagulation of nuclei mode particles
coarse mode, with particles in micrometer range
Most of the smoke material is primarily in coarse particles. Those undergo rapid dry precipitation, and the smoke damage in more distant areas outside of the room where the fire occurs is therefore primarily mediated by the smaller particles.
Aerosol of particles beyond visible size is an early indicator of materials in a preignition stage of a fire.
Burning of hydrogen-rich fuel produces water vapor; this results in smoke containing droplets of water. In absence of other color sources (nitrogen oxides, particulates...), such smoke is white and cloud-like.
Smoke emissions may contain characteristic trace elements. Vanadium is present in emissions from oil fired power plants and refineries; oil plants also emit some nickel. Coal combustion produces emissions containing aluminium, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, selenium, and uranium.
Traces of vanadium in high-temperature combustion products form droplets of molten vanadates. These attack the passivation layers on metals and cause high temperature corrosion, which is a concern especially for internal combustion engines. Molten sulfate and lead particulates also have such effect.
Some components of smoke are characteristic of the combustion source. Guaiacol and its derivatives are products of pyrolysis of lignin and are characteristic of wood smoke; other markers are syringol and derivates, and other methoxy phenols. Retene, a product of pyrolysis of conifer trees, is an indicator of forest fires. Levoglucosan is a pyrolysis product of cellulose. Hardwood vs softwood smokes differ in the ratio of guaiacols/syringols. Markers for vehicle exhaust include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes, steranes, and specific nitroarenes (e.g. 1-nitropyrene). The ratio of hopanes and steranes to elemental carbon can be used to distinguish between emissions of gasoline and diesel engines.
Many compounds can be associated with particulates; whether by being adsorbed on their surfaces, or by being dissolved in liquid droplets. Hydrogen chloride is well absorbed in the soot particles.
Inert particulate matter can be disturbed and entrained into the smoke. Of particular concern are particles of asbestos.
Deposited hot particles of radioactive fallout and bioaccumulated radioisotopes can be reintroduced into the atmosphere by wildfires and forest fires; this is a concern in e.g. the Zone of alienation containing contaminants from the Chernobyl disaster.
Polymers are a significant source of smoke. Aromatic side groups, e.g. in polystyrene, enhance generation of smoke. Aromatic groups integrated in the polymer backbone produce less smoke, likely due to significant charring. Aliphatic polymers tend to generate the least smoke, and are non-self-extinguishing. However presence of additives can significantly increase smoke formation. Phosphorus-based and halogen-based flame retardants decrease production of smoke. Higher degree of cross-linking between the polymer chains has such effect too.


=== Visible and invisible particles of combustion ===

The naked eye detects particle sizes greater than 7 μm (micrometres). Visible particles emitted from a fire are referred to as smoke. Invisible particles are generally referred to as gas or fumes. This is best illustrated when toasting bread in a toaster. As the bread heats up, the products of combustion increase in size. The fumes initially produced are invisible but become visible if the toast is burnt.
An ionization chamber type smoke detector is technically a product of combustion detector, not a smoke detector. Ionization chamber type smoke detectors detect particles of combustion that are invisible to the naked eye. This explains why they may frequently false alarm from the fumes emitted from the red-hot heating elements of a toaster, before the presence of visible smoke, yet they may fail to activate in the early, low-heat smoldering stage of a fire.
Smoke from a typical house fire contains hundreds of different chemicals and fumes. As a result, the damage caused by the smoke can often exceed that caused by the actual heat of the fire. In addition to the physical damage caused by the smoke of a fire – which manifests itself in the form of stains – is the often even harder to eliminate problem of a smoky odor. Just as there are contractors that specialize in rebuilding/repairing homes that have been damaged by fire and smoke, fabric restoration companies specialize in restoring fabrics that have been damaged in a fire.


== Dangers ==
Smoke from oxygen-deprived fires contains a significant concentration of compounds that are flammable. A cloud of smoke, in contact with atmospheric oxygen, therefore has the potential of being ignited – either by another open flame in the area, or by its own temperature. This leads to effects like backdraft and flashover. Smoke inhalation is also a danger of smoke that can cause serious injury and death.

Many compounds of smoke from fires are highly toxic and/or irritating. The most dangerous is carbon monoxide leading to carbon monoxide poisoning, sometimes with the additive effects of hydrogen cyanide and phosgene. Smoke inhalation can therefore quickly lead to incapacitation and loss of consciousness. Sulfur oxides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride in contact with moisture form sulfuric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid, which are corrosive to both lungs and materials. When asleep the nose does not sense smoke nor does the brain, but the body will wake up if the lungs become enveloped in smoke and the brain will be stimulated and the person will be awoken. This does not work if the person is incapacitated or under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

Cigarette smoke is a major modifiable risk factor for lung disease, heart disease, and many cancers.  Smoke is a significant component of ambient air pollution, often resulting from the burning of coal in power plants, forest fires, agricultural burning, and other sources of combustion. Ambient air pollution typically contains particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and other harmful substances, but the concentration of pollutants is generally lower than in cigarette smoke. However, prolonged exposure to ambient pollutants, especially particulate matter like PM2.5, can still pose serious health risks. For example, one day of exposure to PM2.5 at a concentration of 880 μg/m³ can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Long-term exposure to elevated PM2.5 levels is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, and heart disease. Additionally, PM2.5 particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, exacerbating health risks. Climate change can also worsen the frequency and intensity of pollution sources like wildfires, leading to higher concentrations of PM2.5 in certain regions. Such as occurs in Beijing, China, is the equivalent of smoking one or two cigarettes in terms of particulate inhalation by weight. The analysis is complicated, however, by the fact that the organic compounds present in various ambient particulates may have a higher carcinogenicity than the compounds in cigarette smoke particulates. Secondhand tobacco smoke is the combination of both sidestream and mainstream smoke emissions from a burning tobacco product. These emissions contain more than 50 carcinogenic chemicals. According to the United States Surgeon General's 2006 report on the subject, ""Short exposures to secondhand [tobacco] smoke can cause blood platelets to become stickier, damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart variability, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack"". The American Cancer Society lists ""heart disease, lung infections, increased asthma attacks, middle ear infections, and low birth weight"" as ramifications of smoker's emission.

 
Smoke can obscure visibility, impeding occupant exiting from fire areas. In fact, the poor visibility due to the smoke that was in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire in Worcester, Massachusetts was the reason why the trapped rescue firefighters could not evacuate the building in time. Because of the striking similarity that each floor shared, the dense smoke caused the firefighters to become disoriented.


=== Corrosion ===
Smoke can contain a wide variety of chemicals, many of them aggressive in nature. Examples are hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, produced from halogen-containing plastics and fire retardants, hydrofluoric acid released by pyrolysis of fluorocarbon fire suppression agents, sulfuric acid from burning of sulfur-containing materials, nitric acid from high-temperature fires where nitrous oxide gets formed, phosphoric acid and antimony compounds from P and Sb based fire retardants, and many others. Such corrosion is not significant for structural materials, but delicate structures, especially microelectronics, are strongly affected. Corrosion of circuit board traces, penetration of aggressive chemicals through the casings of parts, and other effects can cause an immediate or gradual deterioration of parameters or even premature (and often delayed, as the corrosion can progress over long time) failure of equipment subjected to smoke. Many smoke components are also electrically conductive; deposition of a conductive layer on the circuits can cause crosstalks and other deteriorations of the operating parameters or even cause short circuits and total failures. Electrical contacts can be affected by corrosion of surfaces, and by deposition of soot and other conductive particles or nonconductive layers on or across the contacts. Deposited particles may adversely affect the performance of optoelectronics by absorbing or scattering the light beams.
Corrosivity of smoke produced by materials is characterized by the corrosion index (CI), defined as material loss rate (angstrom/minute) per amount of material gasified products (grams) per volume of air (m3). It is measured by exposing strips of metal to flow of combustion products in a test tunnel. Polymers containing halogen and hydrogen (polyvinyl chloride, polyolefins with halogenated additives, etc.) have the highest CI as the corrosive acids are formed directly with water produced by the combustion, polymers containing halogen only (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene) have lower CI as the formation of acid is limited to reactions with airborne humidity, and halogen-free materials (polyolefins, wood) have the lowest CI. However, some halogen-free materials can also release significant amount of corrosive products.
Smoke damage to electronic equipment can be significantly more extensive than the fire itself. Cable fires are of special concern; low smoke zero halogen materials are preferable for cable insulation.
When smoke comes into contact with the surface of any substance or structure, the chemicals contained in it are transferred to it. The corrosive properties of the chemicals cause the substance or structure to decompose at a rapid rate. Certain materials or structures absorb these chemicals, which is why clothing, unsealed surfaces, potable water, piping, wood, etc., are replaced in most cases of structural fires.


=== Health effects of wood smoke ===

Wood smoke is a major source of air pollution, especially particulate pollution, pollution by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde.
In the United Kingdom domestic combustion, especially for industrial uses, is the largest single source of PM2.5 annually. In some towns and cities in New South Wales, wood smoke may be responsible for 60% of fine particle air pollution in the winter. A year-long sampling campaign in Athens, Greece found a third (31%) of PAH urban air pollution to be caused by wood-burning, roughly as much as that of diesel and oil (33%) and gasoline (29%). It also found that wood-burning is responsible for nearly half (43%) of annual PAH lung cancer-risk compared to the other sources and that wintertime PAH levels were 7 times higher than in other seasons, presumably due to an increased use of fireplaces and heaters. The largest exposure events are periods during the winter with reduced atmospheric dispersion to dilute the accumulated pollution, in particular due to the low wind speeds. Research conducted about biomass burning in 2015, estimated that 38% of European total particulate pollution emissions are composed of domestic wood burning.
Wood smoke (for example from wildfires or wood ovens) can cause lung damage, artery damage and DNA damage leading to cancer, other respiratory and lung disease and cardiovascular disease. Air pollution, particulate matter and wood smoke may also cause brain damage because of particulates breaching the cardiovascular system and into the brain, which can increase the risk of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders mental disorders, and suicidal behavior, although studies on the link between depression and some air pollutants are not consistent. At least one study has identified ""the abundant presence in the human brain of magnetite nanoparticles that match precisely the high-temperature magnetite nanospheres, formed by combustion and/or friction-derived heating, which are prolific in urban, airborne particulate matter (PM)."" Air pollution has also been linked to a range of other psychosocial problems.


== Measurement ==
As early as the 15th century Leonardo da Vinci commented at length on the difficulty of assessing smoke, and distinguished between black smoke (carbonized particles) and white 'smoke' which is not a smoke at all but merely a suspension of harmless water particulates.
Smoke from heating appliances is commonly measured in one of the following ways:
In-line capture. A smoke sample is simply sucked through a filter which is weighed before and after the test and the mass of smoke found. This is the simplest and probably the most accurate method, but can only be used where the smoke concentration is slight, as the filter can quickly become blocked.
The ASTM smoke pump is a simple and widely used method of in-line capture where a measured volume of smoke is pulled through a filter paper and the dark spot so formed is compared with a standard.
Filter/dilution tunnel. A smoke sample is drawn through a tube where it is diluted with air, the resulting smoke/air mixture is then pulled through a filter and weighed. This is the internationally recognized method of measuring smoke from combustion.
Electrostatic precipitation. The smoke is passed through an array of metal tubes which contain suspended wires. A (huge) electrical potential is applied across the tubes and wires so that the smoke particles become charged and are attracted to the sides of the tubes. This method can over-read by capturing harmless condensates, or under-read due to the insulating effect of the smoke. However, it is the necessary method for assessing volumes of smoke too great to be forced through a filter, i.e., from bituminous coal.
Ringelmann scale. A measure of smoke color. Invented by Professor Maximilian Ringelmann in Paris in 1888, it is essentially a card with squares of black, white and shades of gray which is held up and the comparative grayness of the smoke judged. Highly dependent on light conditions and the skill of the observer it allocates a grayness number from 0 (white) to 5 (black) which has only a passing relationship to the actual quantity of smoke. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the Ringelmann scale means that it has been adopted as a standard in many countries.
Optical scattering. A light beam is passed through the smoke. A light detector is situated at an angle to the light source, typically at 90°, so that it receives only light reflected from passing particles. A measurement is made of the light received which will be higher as the concentration of smoke particles becomes higher.
Optical obscuration. A light beam is passed through the smoke and a detector opposite measures the light. The more smoke particles are present between the two, the less light will be measured.
Combined optical methods. There are various proprietary optical smoke measurement devices such as the 'nephelometer' or the 'aethalometer' which use several different optical methods, including more than one wavelength of light, inside a single instrument and apply an algorithm to give a good estimate of smoke. It has been claimed that these devices can differentiate types of smoke and so their probable source can be inferred, though this is disputed.
Inference from carbon monoxide. Smoke is incompletely burned fuel, carbon monoxide is incompletely burned carbon, therefore it has long been assumed that measurement of CO in flue gas (a cheap, simple and very accurate procedure) will provide a good indication of the levels of smoke. Indeed, several jurisdictions use CO measurement as the basis of smoke control. However it is far from clear how accurate the correspondence is.


== Medicinal smoking ==

Throughout recorded history, humans have used the smoke of medicinal plants to cure illness. A sculpture from Persepolis shows Darius the Great (522–486 BC), the king of Persia, with two censers in front of him for burning Peganum harmala and/or sandalwood Santalum album, which was believed to protect the king from evil and disease. More than 300 plant species in 5 continents are used in smoke form for different diseases. As a method of drug administration, smoking is important as it is a simple, inexpensive, but very effective method of extracting particles containing active agents. More importantly, generating smoke reduces the particle size to a microscopic scale thereby increasing the absorption of its active chemical principles.

Rosewood,"Rosewood is wood from trees of the genus Dalbergia. 
The wood of Dalbergia nigra is known as ""Brazilian rosewood"", and also as ""Bahia rosewood"".It has a strong, sweet smell, which lasts for many years.
Another rosewood comes from Dalbergia latifolia known as (East) Indian rosewood or sonokeling (Indonesia). It is native to India and is also grown in plantations elsewhere in Pakistan (Chiniot).
Madagascar rosewood (Dalbergia maritima), known as bois de rose, is highly prized for its red colour. It is overexploited in the wild. A 2010 moratorium on trade and illegal logging is being ignored.
Throughout southeast Asia Dalbergia oliveri is harvested for use in woodworking. It has a fragrant odour. Dalbergia cultrata is being used and sold as D. olvieri.

Predestination,"Predestination is a religious concept, which is about the relationship between God and His creation. The religious character of predestination distinguishes it from other ideas about determinism and free will. Those who believe in predestination, such as John Calvin, believe that before the creation God determined the destiny of the universe throughout all of time and space. They believe that God orders some people to Heaven, and all other people will go to Hell because of their sins. This is determined before they even are born.
Definition: predestination is the divine foreordaining or foreknowledge of all that will happen. It applies to the salvation of some and not others. It has been particularly associated with the teachings of St. Augustine of Hippo and of John Calvin.

Medicine,"Medicine is the science and practice of caring for patients, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.
Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.
Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with ethical, safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.


== Etymology ==
Medicine (UK:  , US:  ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning ""a physician"".


== Clinical practice ==

Medical availability and clinical practice vary across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.
In the developed world, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.
In modern clinical practice, physicians and physician assistants personally assess patients to diagnose, prognose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins with an interaction with an examination of the patient's medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g., stethoscope, tongue depressor) are typically used. After examining for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g., blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions. Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks, depending on the complexity of the issue.
The components of the medical interview and encounter are:

Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the symptoms. They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called chief concern or presenting complaint.
Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.
Family history (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A family tree is sometimes used.
History of present illness (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). Medical history comprises HPI and PMH.
Medications (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, over-the-counter, and home remedies, as well as alternative and herbal medicines or remedies. Allergies are also recorded.
Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past infectious diseases or vaccinations, history of known allergies.
Review of systems (ROS) or systems inquiry: a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss, change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).
Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including diet, medications, tobacco, alcohol).
The physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease that are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms that are volunteered by the patient and are not necessarily objectively observable. The healthcare provider uses sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order, although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.
The clinical examination involves the study of:

Abdomen and rectum
Cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels)
General appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or clubbing)
Genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)
Head, eye, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT)
Musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities)
Neurological (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, cranial nerves, spinal cord and peripheral nerves)
Psychiatric (orientation, mental state, mood, evidence of abnormal perception or thought).
Respiratory (large airways and lungs)
Skin
Vital signs including height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation
It is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.
The treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. A follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system, various forms of ""utilization review"", such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services.
The medical decision-making (MDM) process includes the analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem.
On subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, lab or imaging results, or specialist consultations.


== Institutions ==

Contemporary medicine is, in general, conducted within health care systems. Legal, credentialing, and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have a significant impact on the way medical care is provided.
From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals, and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world. Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States) and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system or compulsory private or cooperative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices, state-owned hospitals and clinics, or charities, most commonly a combination of all three.
Most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those who can afford to pay for it, have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract), or may be covered by care financed directly by the government or tribe.

Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice of patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for its lack of openness, new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.
The health professionals who provide care in medicine comprise multiple professions, such as medics, nurses, physiotherapists, and psychologists. These professions will have their own ethical standards, professional education, and bodies. The medical profession has been conceptualized from a sociological perspective.


=== Delivery ===

Provision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.

Primary care medical services are provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, clinics, nursing homes, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes.
Secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, emergency departments, intensive care medicine, surgery services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.
Tertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include trauma centers, burn treatment centers, advanced neonatology unit services, organ transplants, high-risk pregnancy, radiation oncology, etc.
Modern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.
In low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that ""user fees"" be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.
Separation of prescribing and dispensing is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug. In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.


== Branches ==

Working together as an interdisciplinary team, many highly trained health professionals besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: nurses, emergency medical technicians and paramedics, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, podiatrists, physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, radiographers, dietitians, and bioengineers, medical physicists, surgeons, surgeon's assistant, surgical technologist.
The scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. A patient admitted to the hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.
Physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.
The main branches of medicine are:

Basic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in biomedical research.
Interdisciplinary fields, where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.
Medical specialties


=== Basic sciences ===
Anatomy is the study of the physical structure of organisms. In contrast to macroscopic or gross anatomy, cytology and histology are concerned with microscopic structures.
Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.
Biomechanics is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of Mechanics.
Biophysics is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of physics and physical chemistry to study biological systems.
Biostatistics is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to epidemiology and evidence-based medicine.
Cytology is the microscopic study of individual cells.

Embryology is the study of the early development of organisms.
Endocrinology is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.
Epidemiology is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.
Genetics is the study of genes, and their role in biological inheritance.
Gynecology is the study of female reproductive system.
Histology is the study of the structures of biological tissues by light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
Immunology is the study of the immune system, which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.
Lifestyle medicine is the study of the chronic conditions, and how to prevent, treat and reverse them.
Medical physics is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.
Microbiology is the study of microorganisms, including protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
Molecular biology is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material.
Neuroscience includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the nervous system. A main focus of neuroscience is the biology and physiology of the human brain and spinal cord. Some related clinical specialties include neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry.
Nutrition science (theoretical focus) and dietetics (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, weight and eating disorders, allergies, malnutrition, and neoplastic diseases.
Pathology as a science is the study of disease – the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.
Pharmacology is the study of drugs and their actions.
Photobiology is the study of the interactions between non-ionizing radiation and living organisms.
Physiology is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
Radiobiology is the study of the interactions between ionizing radiation and living organisms.
Toxicology is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and poisons.


=== Specialties ===

In the broadest meaning of ""medicine"", there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which has its own entrance examination. These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term ""Royal"". The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation of a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.
Within medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: ""Medicine"" and ""Surgery"". ""Medicine"" refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine. In the UK, this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland. ""Surgery"" refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General Surgery, which in the UK leads to membership of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (MRCS). At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the Royal College of Anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting for the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).


==== Surgical specialty ====

Surgery is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. In some centers, anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.
Surgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time-consuming.
Surgical subspecialties include those a physician may specialize in after undergoing general surgery residency training as well as several surgical fields with separate residency training. Surgical subspecialties that one may pursue following general surgery residency training: 

Bariatric surgery
Cardiovascular surgery – may also be pursued through a separate cardiovascular surgery residency track
Colorectal surgery
Endocrine surgery
General surgery
Hand surgery
Hepatico-Pancreatico-Biliary Surgery
Minimally invasive surgery
Pediatric surgery
Plastic surgery – may also be pursued through a separate plastic surgery residency track
Surgical critical care
Surgical oncology
Transplant surgery
Trauma surgery
Vascular surgery – may also be pursued through a separate vascular surgery residency track
Other surgical specialties within medicine with their own individual residency training:

Dermatology
Neurosurgery
Ophthalmology
Oral and maxillofacial surgery
Orthopedic surgery
Otorhinolaryngology
Podiatric surgery – do not undergo medical school training, but rather separate training in podiatry school
Urology


==== Internal medicine specialty ====

Internal medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied. In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called ""internists"". Elsewhere, especially in Commonwealth nations, such specialists are often called physicians. These terms, internist or physician (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.
Because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.
In the Commonwealth of Nations and some other countries, specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as specialist physicians (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of primary care.
There are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of internal medicine:

Training in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on medical education for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the US. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.


==== Diagnostic specialties ====
Clinical laboratory sciences are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, clinical chemistry, hematology, clinical microbiology and clinical immunology.
Clinical neurophysiology is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.
Diagnostic radiology is concerned with imaging of the body, e.g. by x-rays, x-ray computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography. Interventional radiologists can access areas in the body under imaging for an intervention or diagnostic sampling.
Nuclear medicine is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a gamma camera or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.
Pathology as a medical specialty is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in evidence-based medicine. Many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.


==== Other major specialties ====
The following are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups:

Anesthesiology (also known as anaesthetics): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor and delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.
Emergency medicine is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including trauma, surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.
Family medicine, family practice, general practice or primary care is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency department coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.

Medical genetics is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.
Neurology is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
Obstetrics and gynecology (often abbreviated as OB/GYN (American English) or Obs & Gynae (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. Reproductive medicine and fertility medicine are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.
Pediatrics (AE) or paediatrics (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.
Pharmaceutical medicine is the medical scientific discipline concerned with the discovery, development, evaluation, registration, monitoring and medical aspects of marketing of medicines for the benefit of patients and public health.
Physical medicine and rehabilitation (or physiatry) is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or congenital disorders.
Podiatric medicine is the study of, diagnosis, and medical and surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.
Preventive medicine is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.
Community health or public health is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis.
Psychiatry is the branch of medicine concerned with the bio-psycho-social study of the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cognitive, perceptual, emotional and behavioral disorders. Related fields include psychotherapy and clinical psychology.


=== Interdisciplinary fields ===
Some interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine include:

Addiction medicine deals with the treatment of addiction.
Aerospace medicine deals with medical problems related to flying and space travel.
Biomedical Engineering is a field dealing with the application of engineering principles to medical practice.
Clinical pharmacology is concerned with how systems of therapeutics interact with patients.
Conservation medicine studies the relationship between human and non-human animal health, and environmental conditions. Also known as ecological medicine, environmental medicine, or medical geology.
Disaster medicine deals with medical aspects of emergency preparedness, disaster mitigation and management.
Diving medicine (or hyperbaric medicine) is the prevention and treatment of diving-related problems.
Evolutionary medicine is a perspective on medicine derived through applying evolutionary theory.
Forensic medicine deals with medical questions in legal context, such as determination of the time and cause of death, type of weapon used to inflict trauma, reconstruction of the facial features using remains of deceased (skull) thus aiding identification.
Gender-based medicine studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease.
Health informatics is a relatively recent field that deal with the application of computers and information technology to medicine.
Hospice and Palliative Medicine is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with terminal illnesses including cancer and heart failure.
Hospital medicine is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called hospitalists in the United States and Canada. The term Most Responsible Physician (MRP) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role.
Laser medicine involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics or treatment of various conditions.
Many other health science fields, e.g. dietetics
Medical ethics deals with ethical and moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine.
Medical humanities includes the humanities (literature, philosophy, ethics, history and religion), social science (anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology), and the arts (literature, theater, film, and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice.
Nosokinetics is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems.
Nosology is the classification of diseases for various purposes.
Occupational medicine is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained.
Pain management (also called pain medicine, or algiatry) is the medical discipline concerned with the relief of pain.
Pharmacogenomics is a form of individualized medicine.
Podiatric medicine is the study of, diagnosis, and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.
Sexual medicine is concerned with diagnosing, assessing and treating all disorders related to sexuality.
Sports medicine deals with the treatment and prevention and rehabilitation of sports/exercise injuries such as muscle spasms",1
Social sculpture,"Social sculpture is a phrase used to describe an expanded concept of art that was invented by the artist and founding member of the German Green Party, Joseph Beuys. Beuys created the term ""social sculpture"" to embody his understanding of art's potential to transform society. As a work of art, a social sculpture includes human activity that strives to structure and shape society or the environment. The central idea of a social sculptor is an artist who creates structures in society using language, thoughts, actions, and objects.


== Concept ==

During the 1960s, Beuys formulated his central theoretical concepts concerning the social, cultural and political function and potential of art. Indebted to Romantic writers such as Novalis and Schiller, Beuys was motivated by a utopian belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident in the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the social ideas of anthroposophy and the work of Rudolf Steiner, of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys' formulation of the concept of social sculpture, in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys' most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is ""Everyone is an artist""). In the video ""Willoughby SHARP, Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues (1974/120 min)"", a record of Beuys' first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful.  In 1973, Beuys wrote:

""Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build ‘A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART’… EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER.""
In 1982, he was invited to create a work for Documenta 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above, one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. 7,000 oak trees were then planted in Kassel, Germany. This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory.
In 1991, ""The Thing"" took its inspiration from the concept of social sculpture.
Since 1994, the Stela for Tolerance is one of the biggest projects worldwide following the concept of social sculpture.
In 2007, at Documenta 12, Kirill Preobrazhenskiy created work ""Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio"". His work was compared by critics with Beuys' oaks.

The ""Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite"" was founded by the artists Joseph Beuys, Johannes Stüttgen and Karl Fastabend on June 19, 1971 in Düsseldorf as a political organization. The goal was influencing social patterns with implementing Beuys' concept of the extended notion of art and the social sculpture via political means. Today, Johannes Stüttgen spread the idea for direct democracy with the project ""Omnibus"".


== Individuality ==
Beuys believed everybody was an artist. He once said ""every sphere of human activity, even peeling a potato can be a work of art as long as it is a conscious act,"" suggesting that every decision should be thought out and attempt to make or contribute to a work of art which in the end is society. Individuality and well-educated decisions are promoted in the person while the government is made of those decisions put into referendums. This point of view invites followers to humble themselves by realizing that they are an important part of a whole not only an individual.

Prophylaxis,"Prophylaxis is a Greek word and concept. It means any action taken to guard or prevent beforehand. The corresponding adjective is prophylactic.


== Two parts ==
The concept of prophylaxis has two parts. First is forethought. A person has to realise the need first of all. Second is taking appropriate action.
Any failure of prophylaxis is a failure at either stage 1 or stage 2. Successful prophylaxis means one has anticipated and avoided some undesirable outcome.


== Examples ==


=== Preventative medicine ===
Prophylaxis is the central idea in preventative medicine. People usually think medical treatment helps sick people to get healthy. Prophylactic treatment is helpful in a different way. Primary prophylaxis tries to stop healthy people from getting sick. Secondary prophylaxis tries to stop people who are sick from getting worse.


=== Birth control ===
Prophylaxis is also be used as a synonym for birth control. Condoms are prophylactic, because when used properly they can prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.

Stonemasonry,"Stonemasonry is the craft of making things out of stone. People who do this are called stonemasons. Their crafts have existed since the start of civilization. They have made important buildings and structures out of stone. This stone comes from the earth. Stone has been used to build many long-lasting things. These could be monuments, artifacts, cathedrals and cities. These can often be seen in many cultures. Some monuments made out of stone include, the Egyptian pyramids and the Greek Parthenon. Stonehenge is also a famous stone building.",0
Smouldering,"Smouldering (British English) or smoldering (American English; see spelling differences) is the slow, flameless form of combustion, sustained by the heat evolved when oxygen directly attacks the surface of a condensed-phase fuel. Many solid materials can sustain a smouldering reaction, including coal, cellulose, wood, cotton, tobacco, cannabis, peat, plant litter, humus, synthetic foams, charring polymers including polyurethane foam and some types of dust. Common examples of smouldering phenomena are the initiation of residential fires on upholstered furniture by weak heat sources (e.g., a cigarette, a short-circuited wire), and the persistent combustion of biomass behind the flaming front of wildfires.


== Fundamentals ==

The fundamental difference between smouldering and flaming combustion is that smouldering occurs on the surface of the solid rather than in the gas phase. Smouldering is a surface phenomenon but can propagate to the interior of a porous fuel if it is permeable to flow. The characteristic temperature and heat released during smouldering are low compared to those in the flaming combustion. Smouldering propagates in a creeping fashion, around 0.1 mm/s (0.0039 in/s), which is about ten times slower than flames spread over a solid. In spite of its weak combustion characteristics, smouldering is a significant fire hazard. Smouldering emits toxic gases (e.g., carbon monoxide) at a higher yield than flaming fires and leaves behind a significant amount of solid residue. The emitted gases are flammable and could later be ignited in the gas phase, triggering the transition to flaming combustion.


== Smouldering materials ==

Many materials can sustain a smouldering reaction, including coal, tobacco, decaying wood and sawdust, biomass fuels on the forest surface (duff) and subsurface (peat), cotton clothing and string, and polymeric foams (e.g., upholstery and bedding materials). Smouldering fuels are generally porous, permeable to flow and formed by aggregates (particulates, grains, fibres or of cellular structure). These aggregates facilitate the surface reaction with oxygen by allowing gas flow through the fuel and providing a large surface area per unit volume. They also act as thermal insulation, reducing heat losses. The most studied materials to date are cellulose and polyurethane foams.


== Threats from smouldering ==
The characteristics of smouldering fires make them a threat of new dimensions, taking the form of colossal underground fires or silent fire safety risks, as summarized below.

 Fire safety: The main hazards posed by smouldering arise from the fact that it can be easily initiated (by heat sources too weak to ignite flames) and is difficult to detect. Fire statistics draw attention to the magnitude of smouldering combustion as the leading cause of fire deaths in residential areas (more than 25% of the fire deaths in the United States are attributed to smoulder-initiated fires, with similar figures in other developed countries). A particularly common fire scenario is a cigarette igniting a piece of upholstered furniture. This ignition leads to a smouldering fire that lasts for a long period of time (in the order of hours), spreading slowly and silently until critical conditions are attained and flames suddenly erupt; fire-resistant cigarettes have been developed to reduce the risk of fire due to smouldering. Smouldering combustion is also a fire-safety concern aboard space facilities (e.g., International Space Station), because the absence of gravity is thought to promote smouldering ignition and propagation.
 Wildfires: Smouldering combustion of the forest ground does not have the visual impact of flaming combustion; however, it has important consequences for the forest ecosystem. Smouldering of biomass can linger for days or weeks after flaming has ceased, resulting in large quantities of fuels consumed and becoming a global source of emissions to the atmosphere. The slow propagation leads to prolonged heating and might cause sterilizations of the soil or the killing of roots, seeds, and plant stems at the ground level.
Subsurface fires: Fires occurring many meters below the surface are a type of smouldering event of colossal magnitude. Subsurface fires in coal mines, peat lands and landfills are rare events, but when active they can smoulder for very long periods of time (months or years), emitting enormous quantities of combustion gases into the atmosphere, causing deterioration of air quality and subsequent health problems. The oldest and largest fires in the world, burning for centuries, are smouldering fires. These fires are fed by the oxygen in the small but continuous flow of air through natural pipe networks, fractured strata, cracks, openings or abandoned mine shafts which permit the air to circulate into the subsurface. The reduced heat losses and high thermal inertia of the underground together with high fuel availability promote long-term smouldering combustion and allow for creeping but extensive propagation. These fires prove difficult to detect, and frustrate most efforts to extinguish them. The dramatic 1997 peatland fires in Borneo caused the recognition of subsurface smouldering fires as a global threat with significant economic, social and ecological impacts. The summer of 2006 saw the resurgence of the Borneo peat fires.
World Trade Center debris: After the attack, fire and subsequent collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, the colossal pile (1.8 million tons) of debris left on the site smouldered for more than five months. It resisted attempts by fire fighters to extinguish it until most of the rubble was removed. The effects of the gaseous and aerosolized products of smouldering on the health of the emergency workers were significant.


== Beneficial applications ==
Smouldering combustion has some beneficial applications.

Biochar is the charcoal produced from the smouldering and/or pyrolysis of biomass. It has the potential to be a short-term solution to lower CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Charcoal is a stable solid and rich in carbon content, and thus, it could be used to lock carbon in the soil. The natural decomposition and burning of trees and agricultural waste contributes with a large amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere. Biochar could be used to store part of this carbon content in the ground, at the same time that its presence in the earth increases soil productivity. Biochar has carbon negative applications for energy production.
In wildfire management, smouldering controlled burns can be used to reduce shallow layers of natural fuels at a slow propagation rate. These fires have two benefits when kept in very shallow layers: they are easy to control and result in little damage to the forest stand
Smouldering of tires producing tar and energy at the same time, is one method of tire recycling.
In situ combustion of petroleum sites is increasingly used for oil recovery when traditional extraction methods prove inefficient or too costly.
In situ smouldering combustion is being explored as a novel remediation technology for soil contamination.

Motion comic,"A motion comic (or animated comic) is a form of animation combining elements of print comic books and animation. Individual panels are expanded into a full shot while sound effects, voice acting, and animation are added to the original artwork. Text boxes, speech bubbles and the onomatopoeia are typically removed to feature more of the original artwork being animated. Motion comics are often released as short serials covering a story arc of a long running series or animating a single release of a graphic novel. Single release issues of a story arc are converted into ten- to twenty-minute-long episodes depending on content.


== History ==
The concept was fully outlined in the mid-1960s by science fiction author Philip K. Dick in his novel The Zap Gun, an expansion of his novella Project Plowshare, which was written in 1964 and first published as a serial in the November 1965 and January 1966 issues of Worlds of Tomorrow magazine. In Dick's novel, weapons designers of the future are mediums, who create their new designs in trance states. The weapon designs are extracted telepathically from a motion comic book, The Blue Cephalopod Man from Titan, created by mad Italian artist Oral Giacomini. Dick describes both the storyline and the animated panels of this comic book in detail. 

 
In the mid 1960s, Marvel Comics Animation used the technique for the television show The Marvel Super Heroes. Actual artwork from the originally published comic books was augmented by voices, music, and a small amount of animation. The term ""motion comic"" did not exist yet.
In 1982, the comic strip Jane was made into a TV series by BBC. It featured brief sequences of a stylized approach to comic panels, partly done with animation, partly with actors in a drawn environment via chroma key.
In 2005, Lions Gate released an animated version of the Saw: Rebirth comic, one of the first examples of an animated comic created to tie into a film franchise. The first major motion comics released, which is also the first use of the term ""motion comic"", were released by Warner Bros., the owner of DC Comics to coincide with the film premieres of The Dark Knight and Watchmen, releasing an adaptation of Batman: Mad Love and Watchmen: Motion Comics, adapting the comic book of the same name. In 2010 a motion comic called Inception: The Cobol Job was released as prequel and prologue to the movie Inception. In 2012 a prequel motion comic of the movie Dredd was made to show the origins of the movie's main antagonist, Ma-Ma.
Marvel Comics has released motion comics using a company owned by Neal Adams. The first release was an adaptation of Joss Whedon and John Cassaday's Astonishing X-Men: ""Gifted"". Other adaptations include Spider-Woman: ""Agent of S.W.O.R.D."", Iron Man: ""Extremis"", Black Panther, Thor/Loki: Blood Brothers, Inhumans and Astonishing X-Men: ""Dangerous"".
Examples from other companies include Peanuts Motion Comics, Zits Motion Comics, the Dead Space prequel comics and the ""Lucy"" element of the ABC News documentary Earth 2100.
Another example would be a four-part motion comic based on the Uncharted video game series as a prequel called Eye of Indra, released for the PlayStation Network.


=== Illustrated films ===
A sibling format to motion comics called illustrated films was developed by transmedia studio HALO 8 Entertainment with their Godkiller, which was produced at the same time as (but separately from) the Watchmen motion comic. As opposed to repurposing an existing comic book, Halo-8 created new sequential art that was designed from its inception to be transmedia art for both a comic book and an illustrated film. Godkiller creator Matt Pizzolo told Bloody Disgusting that ""Godkiller was just a slower production than Watchmen because we had to create 200 pages of art and story from the ground up first, rather than starting with one of the greatest comic books ever made as source material. Plus we had a dozen voice performers instead of just one"".
Although aesthetically similar to motion comics, Pizzolo identifies illustrated film influences as including Liquid Television, the MTV cartoon adaptation of The Maxx, the Berserk anime series, Chris Marker's La jetée, the motion comic Broken Saints, and the experimental cinema of Ralph Bakshi.
According to ComicsAlliance, Pizzolo stated ""the difference between an illustrated film and a motion comic is kind of the difference between a movie that was shot in 3D versus a movie that was shot in 2D but got a 3D post-conversion. We're not repurposing an existing comic book here, we're building something unique from scratch"".
The 75-minute Godkiller feature was released theatrically in 11 cities before it was distributed on DVD and cable VOD.
Other illustrated films from Halo-8 include Ben Templesmith's original project Black Sky and an adaptation of Tim Seeley's Hack/Slash, but those projects are currently in development limbo.


== Reception ==
Artist John Cassaday described his experience with the motion comic adaptation of Astonishing X-Men in an interview with ComicBookResources.com:

I'd seen some motion comic animation, and the quality varied. When Marvel approached me, I was initially hesitant, but after looking at some test footage and hearing how committed they were, I knew what direction they were wanting to go"".


== Comparison to visual novels ==
The visual novel, a form of interactive fiction largely created in Japan (and also constituting the majority of PC games sold in the country), makes similar usage of animated transitions between still graphic images for narrative purposes. Visual novels, which have been released since the 1980s, also make use of background music and voice talents in order to help drive the narrative.
Unlike most Western motion comics: 

Visual novels only occasionally make use of motion in-scene (i.e., a body part moving inside an otherwise-static scene).
Visual novels, while making use of voice talents, also provide dialogue through dialogue boxes - usually superimposed on the bottom of the screen.
Visual novel characters are usually depicted through graphic sprites superimposed upon a generic background; more detailed character designs and backgrounds are typically reserved for key scenes and events in the narrative.
The majority of visual novels are original properties and are adapted for, rather than adaptations of, manga or anime.
Visual novels can either be little more than interactive films or much more interactive adventure games, with the dialog boxes containing controls for interaction with the game.
Visual novels are also typically written from the first-person narrative.
Most visual novels have dialogue choices, branching storylines, and multiple endings.
The visual novel franchise Danganronpa uses motion manga as a gameplay element at the climax of each chapter, with a brief reoccurrence in the Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School anime.

Lp0 on fire,"lp0 on fire (also known as Printer on Fire) is an outdated error message generated on some Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems in response to certain types of printer errors. lp0 is the Unix device handle for the first line printer, but the error can be displayed for any printer attached to a Unix or Linux system. It indicates a printer error that requires further investigation to diagnose, but not necessarily that it is on fire.


== Printer flammability ==
In the late 1950s, high speed computerized printing was still a somewhat experimental field. The first documented fire-starting printer was a Stromberg-Carlson 5000 xerographic printer (similar to a modern laser printer, but with a CRT as the light source instead of a laser), installed around 1959 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and modified with an extended fusing oven to achieve a print speed of one page per second. In the event of a printing stall, and occasionally during normal operation, the fusing oven would cause the paper to combust. This fire risk was aggravated by the fact that if the printer continued to operate, it would feed a fire with fresh paper at high speed. However, there is no evidence of the ""lp0 on fire"" message appearing in any software of the time.
As the technology matured, most large printer installations were drum printers, a type of impact printer which could print an entire line of text at once through the use of a high speed rotary printing drum. It was thought that in the event of a severe jam, the friction of paper against the drum could ignite either the paper itself, or, in a dirty machine, the accumulated paper and ink dust in the mechanism. Whether this ever happened is not known; there are no reports of friction-related printer fires.
The line printer employed a series of status codes, specifically ready, online, and check. If the online status was set to ""off"" and the check status was set to ""on,"" the operating system would interpret this as the printer running out of paper. However, if the online code was set to ""on"" and the check code was also set to ""on"", it meant that the printer still had paper, but was suffering an error (and may still be attempting to run). Due to the potentially hazardous conditions which could arise in early line printers, UNIX displayed the message ""on fire"" to motivate any system operator viewing the message to go and check on the line printer immediately.
In the early 1980s, Xerox created a prototype laser printer engine and provided units to various computer companies. To fuse the toner, the paper path passed a glowing wire. If paper jammed anywhere in the path, the sheet in the fuser caught fire. The prototype UNIX driver reported paper jams as ""on fire.""  Later print engine models used a hot drum in place of the wire.


== Phrase origins ==
Michael K. Johnson (""mkj"" of Red Hat and Fedora fame) wrote the first Linux version of this error message in 1992. However, he, Herbert Rosmanith and Alan Cox (all Linux developers) have acknowledged that the phrase existed in Unix in different forms prior to his Linux printer implementation.
Since then, the lp printer code has spread across all sorts of POSIX-compliant operating systems, which often still retain this legacy message.
Modern printer drivers and support have improved and hidden low-level error messages from users, so most Unix/Linux users today have never seen the ""on fire"" message. The ""on fire"" message remains in the Linux source code as of version 6.0.
The message is also present in other software modules, often to humorous effect. For example, in some kernels' CPU code, a CPU thermal failure could result in the message ""CPU#0: Possible thermal failure (CPU on fire ?)"" and similar humor can be found in the phrase ""halt and catch fire"".

Costa del Sol,"The Costa del Sol (literally ""Coast of the Sun"") is a region in the south of Spain in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It includes the coastal towns and communities along the coastline of the Province of Málaga and the eastern part of Campo de Gibraltar in Cádiz. Formerly made up only of a series of small fishing settlements, today the region is a world-renowned tourist destination. The Costa del Sol is  between two lesser known coastal regions, the Costa de la Luz and the Costa Tropical.
The region has no official limit, but it is generally accepted that the Costa del Sol stretches from the municipality of La Línea de la Concepción in the west to Nerja in the east,  around 150 kilometers of coastline. The term Costa del Sol was coined at the beginning of the 20th century by Rodolfo Lussnigg to promote the Almería coastline. Until the late 1960s, it was used in reference to the entire Mediterranean coast of Eastern Andalusia. The name refers to the sunny climate, present in the region most days of the year. The Costa del Sol is one of the most important tourist areas in Spain. Around 35% of Andalusia's tourism is concentrated in the region; in 2009 it had 17 million overnight stays.
The population of the Costa del Sol varies depending on the time of year. Many people own holiday homes in the region. According to the latest available data from the National Statistics Institute of Spain, The population of the province of Malaga was about 1.6 million in 2020.

The Costa del Sol is known for its sunny weather, with more than 300 days of sunshine per year.
The region is home to several historic landmarks and cultural attractions, including the Alhambra Palace in Granada and the Picasso Museum in Malaga.
The Costa del Sol is famous for its beaches, with over 160 kilometres of coastline and more than 70 beaches.
The region is also known for its gastronomy, with a variety of local dishes and delicacies, including paella, gazpacho, and fried fish.
It is a popular destination for golf enthusiasts, with over 70 golf courses
The region is home to several festivals and celebrations throughout the year, including the Malaga Fair in August and the Three Kings Parade in January.
There is a diverse expat community, with many British, German, and Scandinavian residents living in the region.
It has a rich history and cultural heritage, with evidence of settlements dating back to the Phoenicians and the Romans.


== History of the Costa del Sol ==
The history of the Costa del Sol dates back to the time of the Phoenicians and the Romans.
The Phoenicians were the first to establish a settlement in the region. The Romans founded the city of Malaca (modern-day Malaga) around 300 BC. During the Roman period, the region became a successful centre for trade, agriculture, and mining. The Romans built several towns and ports along the coast, including Cartama, Velez-Malaga, and Almuñecar. In the ninth century AD, the Moors invaded Spain and introduced Islam to the country. They dominated the Costa del Sol for centuries. They left a cultural legacy that can still be seen in some of the region's most prominent landmarks. The Moors established irrigation and agriculture systems in the area and introduced crops like olives, almonds, oranges, and lemons.
In 1487, the Spanish monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, conquered the Costa del Sol and the rest of Andalusia. The Catholic monarchs encouraged the resettlement of the region by Christians, leading to the construction of many churches and monasteries.
In the 20th century, the Costa del Sol became a desired tourist destination. The first luxury hotels were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, followed by a boom in the construction of holiday homes and apartments in the 1970s and 1980s. The tourism industry has since become a significant economic driver for the region. Millions of visitors flock to the Costa del Sol every year to enjoy its pleasant climate, beautiful beaches, and cultural attractions.


== Public Transport ==
There are several public transport options available to travel from Malaga airport to the Costa del Sol:
Several bus lines connect Malaga airport with various destinations along the Costa del Sol, including Torremolinos, Benalmadena, Fuengirola, Marbella, and Estepona. The bus stops are located outside Terminal 3, and tickets can be purchased from the driver or at the ticket machines at the bus stop.
The suburban train (C1 line) runs from Malaga airport to Fuengirola, with stops at Torremolinos, Benalmadena, and other towns along the way. The train station is located across from Terminal 3, and tickets can be purchased at the ticket machines or the ticket office.
Taxis are available at the taxi rank outside each terminal. The taxi fare is determined by the distance traveled and the time of day. The main taxi company at Malaga Airport is Unitaxi.
Several car rental companies have offices at the airport, and renting a car can be a convenient way to explore the Costa del Sol.
Public transport is a convenient and affordable way to travel from Malaga airport to the Costa del Sol, with options to suit all budgets and travel preferences.
Private Malaga airport transfers: If you prefer, you can also pre-book with a private Malaga airport transfer company, It's always a good idea to read reviews and compare prices before booking a private transfer. That way, you can find a company that meets your needs and fits your budget.

The Jeffrey pine and the ponderosa pine are common in drier montane areas of the Sierra Nevada. They are often confused by casual observers. Across the remainder of the American West, Jeffrey pine is absent, with ponderosa pine being the sole yellow pine.
Jeffrey pine is more stress tolerant than ponderosa pine in the Sierra Nevada. At higher elevations, on poorer (including ultramafic) soils, in colder climates, and in drier climates, Jeffrey pine replaces ponderosa as the dominant tree (Jeffrey pine forest). Ponderosa pine-dominated forests (""Ponderosa pine forest"") occur at elevations from about 300 to 2,100 m (980 to 6,890 ft). Jeffrey pine-dominated forests occur mostly in California, from 1,500 to 2,400 m (4,900 to 7,900 ft) in the north, and 1,700 to 2,800 m (5,600 to 9,200 ft) in the south. The highest elevations are typically on the east side of the Sierra Nevada. ""Eastside pine forest"" refers to areas of Lassen National Forest, Plumas National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest, all on the east of the Sierra Nevada crest, where ponderosa and Jeffrey pine codominate.

Ponderosa pine forests occurs on the Colorado Plateau and in the Sierra Nevada of the Western United States, as well as other parts of North America.
One way to distinguish between them is by their cones. Each has barbs at the end of the scales. The sharp Jeffrey pine cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to the palm of one's hand when rubbed down the cone. Ponderosa pine cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to the palm of one's hands. Another distinguishing characteristic is that the needles of Jeffrey pine are glaucous, less bright green than those of ponderosa pine, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs.
Jeffrey pine wood and ponderosa pine wood are sold together as yellow pine. Both kinds of wood are hard (with a Janka hardness of 550 lbf (2,400 N)), but the western yellow pine wood is less dense than southern yellow pine wood (28 lb/cu ft (0.45 g/cm3) versus 35 lb/cu ft (0.56 g/cm3) for shortleaf pine).


== Southern United States ==

In the Southern United States, yellow pines can refer to one of the native species: loblolly, longleaf, shortleaf, or slash pines. These yellow pines grow very well in the acidic red clay soil found in most of the region. The wood from the southern yellow pines typically has a density value between 50 and 55 lb/cu ft (0.80 and 0.88 g/cm3) when pressure treated. Yellow pine grows across the South and Mid-Atlantic regions, from Texas to New Jersey.
Dimensional lumber and plywood products manufactured from southern yellow pine are used extensively in home construction in the United States. They are also used for wooden roller coasters and are most used for utility poles throughout the United States.


== New Zealand ==
Halocarpus biformis, a species of podocarp, is known as yellow pine in New Zealand. It is a tight-grained, sweet-smelling, and extremely durable wood.

Half-month,"The half-month is a calendar subdivision used in astronomy. Each calendar month is separated into two parts:

days 1 to 15
day 16 until the end of the month.
Newly identified small Solar System bodies, such as comets and asteroids, are given systematic designations that contain the half-month encoded as a letter of the English alphabet. For example, an object discovered in the second half of January would be identified with the letter B; if found in the first half of February, the letter would be C. The letter I is not used, to prevent confusion with the number 1. Instead, the letters proceed directly from H (April 16–30) to J (May 1–15). The letter appears in the provisional designation, then when the object is confirmed the letter is incorporated into the comet designation (for comets) or minor planet designation (for asteroids and other minor planets).

Lignum nephriticum,"Lignum nephriticum (Latin for ""kidney wood"") is a traditional diuretic that was derived from the wood of two tree species, the narra (Pterocarpus indicus) and the Mexican kidneywood (Eysenhardtia polystachya). The wood is capable of turning the color of water it comes in contact with into beautiful opalescent hues that change depending on light and angle, the earliest known record of the phenomenon of fluorescence. Due to this strange property, it became well known in Europe from the 16th to the early 18th century. Cups made from lignum nephriticum were given as gifts to royalty. Water drunk from such cups, as well as imported powders and extracts from lignum nephriticum, were thought to have great medicinal properties.
The lignum nephriticum derived from Mexican kidneywood was known as the coatli, coatl, or cuatl (""snake water"") or tlapalezpatli (""blood-tincture medicine"") in the Nahuatl language. It was traditionally used by the Aztec people as a diuretic prior to European contact. Similarly, the lignum nephriticum cups made from narra wood were part of the native industry of the Philippines before the arrival of the Spanish. The cups were manufactured in southern Luzon, particularly in the Naga region. The name of which was derived from the abundance of the narra trees, which was known as naga in the Bikol language (literally ""serpent"" or ""dragon"").


== History ==

The first known description of the medicine appears in the Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva España (1560–1564) by the Spanish Franciscan missionary and ethnographer Bernardino de Sahagún. In the most famous surviving manuscripts of the work, the Florentine Codex, Sahagún called it by its Nahuatl name, coatli, given by Aztec healers. He described its unusual property of turning the color of water that comes in contact with it to bright blue: ""...patli, yoan aqujxtiloni, matlatic iniayo axixpatli [...it is a medicine, and makes the water of blue color, its juice is medicinal for the urine]"".
The Spanish physician and botanist Nicolás Monardes also independently described the medicine in his 1565 work Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales. He is the origin of the name lignum nephriticum, due to the use of the wood to treat liver and kidney ailments in New Spain. He described the wood as white in color. It was prepared by being sliced into very thin chips. The chips were then placed in clear spring water. After about half an hour, the water starts to turn a very pale blue, turning bluer as time passes. The water is then drunk neat or mixed with wine. He observed that despite the change in color, the wood itself imparts no taste to the water.
In 1570, Francisco Hernández de Toledo, the court physician of King Philip II of Spain, led what is considered the first scientific expedition to the Americas. When he returned to Spain in 1577, he gave testimony of the medicinal properties of lignum nephriticum, as described by Monardes. However, he expressed uncertainty as to its origin, stating that while he was told the source plant was a shrub, he had personally also witnessed specimens that reached the size of very large trees.
In 1646, Athanasius Kircher, a German Jesuit scholar residing in Rome, published an account of his experiments on lignum nephriticum in his work Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ. He conducted his experiments on a cup given to him as a gift from Jesuit missionaries in Mexico. He commented that while previous authors only described the color of the water mixed with lignum nephriticum as blue, his own experiments actually showed that the wood turned the water into all kinds of colors, depending on the light. He later presented the cup to the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III.

The wood of the tree thus described, when made into a cup, tinges water when poured into it at first a deep blue, the color of a Bugloss flower; and the longer the water stands in it the deeper the color it assumes. If then the water is poured into a glass globe and held against the light, no vestige of the blue color will be seen, but it will appear to observers like pure clean spring water, limpid and clear. But if you move this glass phial toward a more shady place the liquid will assume a most delightful greenness, and if to a still more shady place, a reddish color; and thus it will change color in a marvelous way according to the nature of its background. In the dark, however, or in an opaque vase, it will once more assume its blue color.
A second cup was described by in 1650 by the Swiss botanist Johann Bauhin in his great work Historia plantarum universalis. He had received it under the name palum indianum from a colleague. Unlike the wood in Monardes' account, the wood the cup was made from was reddish in color. It was a handspan in diameter, about 9 in (23 cm), and adorned with variegated lines. Shavings from the same wood were included with the cup. Bauhin observed that when water was poured into the cup with the wood shavings, the water shortly turned into ""a wonderful blue and yellow color, and when held up against the light beautifully resembled the varying color of the opal, giving forth reflections, as in that gem, of fiery yellow, bright red, glowing purple, and sea green most wonderful to behold."" Bauhin believed that the wood was taken from a species of ash (Fraxinus).
In 1664, Robert Boyle explained the phenomenon to be dependent on pH. In an unpublished paper in 1665, Sir Isaac Newton first mentioned the cups in the paper ""Of Colours"". He later also mentioned in 1672, in his theories of light and color. However, the botanical origin of wood used in lignum nephriticum was eventually lost in the late 18th century.


== Modern studies ==
In 1915, the source of the wood was rediscovered by the American botanist William Edwin Safford. He deduced that lignum nephriticum actually came from two species of trees that became confused as one. He identified the original traditional remedy described by Monardes as Mexican kidneywood, a native of Mexico, while the cups which became famous in Europe were originally carved from narra wood by the inhabitants of southern Luzon from the Philippines. It was imported into Mexico through the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade and from there, introduced to Europe. Both species are members of the legume family Fabaceae.
It is now known that Sahagún's and Monardes' accounts are the earliest known records of the phenomenon of fluorescence. The unusual property of the wood was caused by the compound matlaline, which is the oxidation product of one of the flavonoids found in the wood. The phenomenon is also exhibited by other members of the family Fabaceae.

BMW V12 LMR Art Car,"The BMW Art Car Project was introduced by the French racecar driver and auctioneer Hervé Poulain, who wanted to invite an artist to create a canvas on an automobile.
In 1975, Poulain commissioned American artist and friend Alexander Calder to paint the first BMW Art Car. This first example would be a BMW 3.0 CSL which Poulain himself would race in the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race.
Since Calder's work of art, many other renowned artists throughout the world have created BMW Art Cars, including  David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol. To date, a total of 20 BMW Art Cars, based on both racing and regular production vehicles, have been created. Frank Stella also made one unofficial art car at the behest of race car driver Peter Gregg. The most recent artist to the join BMW Art Car program is Cao Fei in 2017 with her M6. Artists for the BMW Art Car Project are chosen by a panel of international judges.
According to Thomas Girst, who has been in charge of the BMW Art Cars project since 2004, the purpose of the project has changed over time: ""In the beginning the cars were raced. There wasn't much of a public relations effort around them... Since then, some of the Art Cars have been used in advertisements to show that BMW is a player in the arts. With the Eliason work, part of what we are doing is raising awareness of alternative and renewable energy sources.""


== BMW Art Cars ==

* The 2009 project by Robin Rhode did not create an art car, but rather used a BMW Z4 driven over a giant canvas to create a work by applying paint with the car's tires.
** Car shown in the BMW Museum, without the original digital lighting enhancements that were part of the art.


== Miniatures ==
Since 2003, BMW has released the Art Cars (at the time, this encompassed the entire series) as 1:18 scale miniature diecast.
They are sold in limited edition by BMW dealers and shops. All of them have an elegant acrylic display and a grey base, iconic package with red box and an ""art car"" booklet inside. The first two to be released were Alexander Calder's BMW 3.0 CSL and Jenny Holzer's BMW V12 LMR. Initially 3000 copies each were to be produced with an MSRP of $125 (now $145) each.
Nowadays there are 17 miniatures, but there are 19 Bmw art cars, simply of 2 there are no miniatures. Only the works of Olafur Eliasson and Cao Fei do not have official miniatures because they are conceptual works.


== Public display ==
In 2009, the Art Cars began a North American tour, starting at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from February 12–24.  The second stop was in New York City from March 24 to April 6, in a special exhibit at Grand Central Terminal held in its Vanderbilt Hall. The Cars were exhibited in México, first in MARCO, Monterrey, and later in Guadalajara and Mexico City. In July 2012 a selection of the cars were presented by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in a Shoreditch car park as part of the London 2012 Festival, entitled Art Drive!.


== Unofficial BMW Art Cars ==
In addition to the work commissioned by BMW, other artists have created unofficial BMW art cars. In 1979 racing driver Peter Gregg purchased a BMW M1 Procar and commissioned his friend Frank Stella to paint it for him; this car is the only BMW painted by an artist who was also part of BMW's own Art Car program. and was sold from the Guggenheim Museum to a BMW dealer in Long Island, New York in 2011. The car is part of Stella's ""Polar Coordinates"" series, created to commemorate Stella's friend Ronnie Peterson who had died in a racing incident at Monza in 1978. In 1987 Keith Haring painted a red BMW Z1 at Hans Mayer Gallery, Düsseldorf. In 1996 Artist Dennis Simon was commissioned to create a BMW Motorsport tribute on the flanks of a 1965 BMW 1800 Ti/SA for BMW's 80th birthday at the Monterey Historics in Laguna Seca, CA. In 2007, Portland's Museum of Contemporary Craft commissioned artist Tom Cramer to paint a 1977 BMW 320i for their grand opening at the DeSoto Building. In 2016, the Cultural Council of Greater Jacksonville commissioned artist Christie Chandler to paint a BMW X6 for their annual awards gala at TPC Sawgrass.

Secondary animation,"Secondary animation, also known as secondary motion, is flat motions generated as a reaction to the movement of primary motion by a character. It is significant in animation because it amplifies the character's motion via effects that appear to be driven by the motion, i.e. it makes the character's motion seem natural. Examples of secondary motion include the rippling of water, swish of a cloak, or jiggle of body parts when a person is moving. These passive effects have many degrees of freedom, and complex interactions with characters, thus making them hard to animate by hand (hand animation), or via computer software.


== Techniques ==
Creating a second motion requires using a technique called coupling that combines simulations of individual objects allowing them to interact together to produce secondary motion. The coupling can be divided into three categories: two-way coupled, one-way coupled, and hybrid.

Two-way coupled - The purpose of a two-way coupled simulation is to model the interaction as realistically as possible given the component systems. Two-way interactions affect the two components, and the forces applied to one is mirrored by equal and opposite forces applied to the second. The actions of each system directly affect the other. However, the main drawback of this coupling method is the computation time required before the path of an object can be viewed. If simulated alone, the object can be viewed in real time allowing the animator to apply instant changes to its motion. When two simulations are coupled, the animator must wait before a motion can be viewed.
One-way coupled - In the one-way coupled system, the interaction forces are applied only to the secondary system, leaving the primary one unaffected. This way of disregarding depends on the assumption that minimal effect will fall upon the primary system. This situation is likely to happen when one system's mass is greater than the other. One advantage of this coupling approach is that it allows the individual simulation of each system. Generally, it is also easier to implement than the two-way coupled system because only the secondary system is adjusted. It also permits the coupling where it is not possible or favorable to modify the primary system such as in the case of a hand-animated character.
Hybrid - A hybrid system is a concession between the accuracy of the two-way coupling system and the speed of the one-way coupling. Instead of completely ignoring the effect of the interaction on the primary system, a small approximation from the secondary system is allowed to interact with the primary system. The design and parameters of the approximation provide the animator with additional controls, and because the hybrid coupling is supposed to provide a shorter debug cycle time for the primary system than the two-way coupling method, the animator may interactively modify these parameters until the desired result is reached.

Vessel element,"A vessel element or vessel member (also called a xylem vessel) is one of the cell types found in xylem, the water conducting tissue of plants. Vessel elements are found in most angiosperms (flowering plants) and in some gymnosperms such as cycads and Ephedra, but absent in conifers. Vessel elements are the main feature distinguishing the ""hardwood"" of angiosperms from the ""softwood"" of conifers.


== Anatomy ==
Xylem is the tissue in vascular plants that conducts water (and substances dissolved in it) upwards from the roots to the shoots. Two kinds of cell are involved in xylem transport: tracheids and vessel elements. Vessel elements are the building blocks of vessels, the conducting pathways that constitute the major part of the water transporting system in flowering plants. Vessels form an efficient system for transporting water (including necessary minerals) from the root to the leaves and other parts of the plant.

In secondary xylem – the xylem that is produced as a stem thickens rather than when it first appears – a vessel element originates from the vascular cambium. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a ""fusiform initial"", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a vessel element becomes strongly ""lignified"", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of lignin. The side walls of a vessel element have pits: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called perforations or perforation plates. They have a variety of shapes: the most common are the simple perforation (a simple opening) and the scalariform perforation (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design). Other types include the foraminate perforation plate (several round openings) and the reticulate perforation plate (a net-like pattern, with many openings).
At maturity, the protoplast – the living material of the cell – dies and disappears, but the lignified cell walls persist. A vessel element is then a dead cell, but one that still has a function, and is still being protected by surrounding living cells.


== Evolutionary significance ==
The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered to be one of the key innovations that led to the success of the flowering plants. It was once thought that vessel elements were an evolutionary innovation of flowering plants, but their absence from some basal angiosperms and their presence in some members of the Gnetales suggest that this hypothesis must be re-examined; vessel elements in Gnetales may not be homologous with those of angiosperms, or vessel elements that originated in a precursor to the angiosperms may have been subsequently lost in some basal lineages (e.g., Amborellaceae, Trochodendraceae, and Winteraceae), described by Arthur Cronquist as ""primitively vesselless"". Cronquist considered the vessels of Gnetum to be convergent with those of angiosperms.
Vessel-like cells have also been found in the xylem of Equisetum (horsetails), Selaginella (spike-mosses), Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern), Marsilea and Regnellidium (aquatic ferns), and the enigmatic fossil group Gigantopteridales. In these cases, it is generally agreed that the vessels evolved independently. It is possible that vessels may have appeared more than once among the angiosperms as well.

Coin,"A coin is a small object, usually round and flat, used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender. They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade. They are most often issued by a government. Coins often have images, numerals, or text on them. The faces of coins or medals are sometimes called the obverse and the reverse, referring to the front and back sides, respectively. The obverse of a coin is commonly called heads, because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse is known as tails.
The first metal coins – invented in the ancient Greek world and disseminated during the Hellenistic period – were precious metal–based, and were invented in order to simplify and regularize the task of measuring and weighing bullion (bulk metal) carried around for the purpose of transactions. They carried their value within the coins themselves, but the stampings also induced manipulations, such as the clipping of coins to remove some of the precious metal.
Most modern coinage metals are base metal, and their value comes from their status as fiat money — the value of the coin is established by law. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulated coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, primarily due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law). Currently coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually, the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. Coins are usually more efficient than banknotes because they last longer: banknotes last only about four years, compared with 30 years for a coin.
Exceptions to the rule of face value being higher than content value currently occur for bullion coins made of copper, silver, or gold (and rarely other metals, such as platinum or palladium), intended for collectors or investors in precious metals. Examples of modern gold collector/investor coins include the British sovereign minted by the United Kingdom, the American Gold Eagle minted by the United States, the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf minted by Canada, and the Krugerrand, minted by South Africa. While the Eagle and Sovereign coins have nominal (purely symbolic) face values, the Krugerrand does not. Commemorative coins usually serve as collectors items only, although some countries also issue commemorative coins for regular circulation, such as the 2€ commemorative coins and U.S. America the Beautiful quarters.


== History ==
Early metal coinage came into use about the time of the Axial Age in West Asia, in the Greek world, in northern India, and in China.


=== Bullion and unmarked metals ===

Metal ingots, silver bullion or unmarked bars were probably in use for exchange among many of the civilizations that mastered metallurgy. The weight and purity of bullion would be the key determinant of value. In the Achaemenid Empire in the early 6th century BC, coinage was yet unknown. The barter system, as well as silver bullion were used instead for trade. The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have been current in Central Asia from the 6th century BC. Coins were an evolution of ""currency"" systems of the Late Bronze Age, when various cultures used standard-sized ingots and tokens such as knife money to store and transfer value. Phoenician metal ingots had to be stamped with the name of a current ruler to guarantee their worth and value, which is probably how stamping busts and designs began, although political advertising – glorification of a state or of a ruler – may also play a role.


=== Tongbei in Bronze Age China (c. 1100 BC) ===
In the late Chinese Bronze Age, standardized cast tokens were made, such as those discovered in a tomb near Anyang. These were replicas in bronze of earlier Chinese currency, cowrie shells, so they were named ""Bronze Shell"".


=== China Henan Coin Factory (c. 640 – 550 BC) ===
The world's oldest known coin factory has been excavated in the ancient city Guanzhuang in Henan province in China. The factory produced shovel-shaped bronze coins between 640 B.C. and 550 B.C., making it the oldest securely-dated minting-site.


=== Iron Age ===


==== Lydian and Ionian electrum coins (c. 600 BC) ====

The earliest coins are mostly associated with Iron Age Anatolia of the late 7th century BC, and especially with the kingdom of Lydia. Early electrum coins (an alluvial alloy of gold and silver, varying wildly in proportion, and usually about 40–55% gold) were not standardized in weight, and in their earliest stage may have been ritual objects, such as badges or medals, issued by priests. The unpredictability of the composition of naturally occurring electrum implied that it had a variable value, which greatly hampered its development.
Most of the early Lydian coins include no writing (""myth"" or ""inscription""), only an image of a symbolic animal. Therefore, the dating of these coins relies primarily on archaeological evidence, with the most commonly cited evidence coming from excavations at the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, also called the Ephesian Artemision (which would later evolve into one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). This was the site of the earliest known deposit of electrum coins. Anatolian Artemis was the Πότνια Θηρῶν (Potnia Thêrôn, ""Mistress of Animals""), whose symbol was the stag. It took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day's subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread. Maybe the first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions, Hemiobol, Ancient Greek coinage minted by the Ionian Greeks in the late sixth century BC.
In contrast Herodotus mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians:

So far as we have any knowledge, they [the Lydians] were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coins, and the first who sold goods by retail.
And both Aristotle (fr. 611,37, ed. V. Rose) and Pollux (Onamastikon IX.83), mention that the first issuer of coinage was Hermodike/Demodike of Cyme. Cyme was a city in Aeolia, nearby Lydia.

Another example of local pride is the dispute about coinage, whether the first one to strike it was Pheidon of Argos, or Demodike of Kyme (who was wife of Midas the Phrygian and daughter of King Agammemnon of Kyme), or Erichthonios and Lycos of Athens, or the Lydians (as Xenophanes says) or the Naxians (as Anglosthenes thought).
Many early Lydian and Greek coins were minted under the authority of private individuals and are thus more akin to tokens or badges than to modern coins, though due to their numbers it is evident that some were official state issues. The earliest inscribed coins are those of Phanes, dated to 625–600 BC from Ephesus in Ionia, with the legend ΦΑΕΝΟΣ ΕΜΙ ΣHΜΑ (or similar) (""I am the badge/sign/mark of Phanes/light"") or just bearing the name ΦΑΝΕΟΣ (""of Phanes"").
The first electrum coins issued by a monarch are those minted by king Alyattes of Lydia (died c. 560 BC), for which reason this king is sometimes mentioned as the originator of coinage.


==== Croesus: Pure gold and silver coins ====

The successor of Alyattes, king Croesus (r. c. 560–546 BC), became associated with great wealth in Greek historiography. He is credited with issuing the Croeseid, the first true gold coins with a standardized purity for general circulation. and the world's first bimetallic monetary system c. 550 BC.
Coins spread rapidly in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, leading to the development of Ancient Greek coinage and Achaemenid coinage, and further to Illyrian coinage.


==== Achaemenid coinage (546–330 BC) ====

When Cyrus the Great (550–530 BC) came to power, coinage was unfamiliar in his realm. Barter and to some extent silver bullion was used instead for trade. The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have been current in Central Asia from the 6th century.
Cyrus the Great introduced coins to the Persian Empire after 546 BC, following his conquest of Lydia and the defeat of its king Croesus, who had put in place the first coinage in history. With his conquest of Lydia, Cyrus acquired a region in which coinage was invented, developed through advanced metallurgy, and had already been in circulation for about 50 years, making the Lydian Kingdom one of the leading trade powers of the time. It seems Cyrus initially adopted the Lydian coinage as such, and continued to strike Lydia's lion-and-bull coinage.
Original coins of the Achaemenid Empire were issued from 520 BC – 450 BC to 330 BC. The Persian Daric was the first truly Achaemenid gold coin which, along with a similar silver coin, the Siglos, represented the bimetallic monetary standard of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.


===== Coinage of Southern Asia under the Achaemenid Empire =====

The Achaemenid Empire already reached the doors of India during the original expansion of Cyrus the Great, and the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley is dated to c. 515 BC under Darius I. An Achaemenid administration was established in the area. The Kabul hoard, also called the Chaman Hazouri hoard, is a coin hoard discovered in the vicinity of Kabul, Afghanistan, containing numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many Greek coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The deposit of the hoard is dated to the Achaemenid period, in approximately 380 BC. The hoard also contained many locally produced silver coins, minted by local authorities under Achaemenid rule. Several of these issues follow the ""western designs"" of the facing bull heads, a stag, or Persian column capitals on the obverse, and incuse punch on the reverse.
According to numismatist Joe Cribb, these finds suggest that the idea of coinage and the use of punch-marked techniques was introduced to India from the Achaemenid Empire during the 4th century BC. More Achaemenid coins were also found in Pushkalavati and in Bhir Mound.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


==== Greek Archaic coinage (until about 480 BC) ====

According to Aristotle (fr. 611,37, ed. V. Rose) and Pollux (Onamastikon IX.83), the first issuer of Greek coinage was Hermodike of Kyme.
A small percentage of early Lydian/Greek coins have a legend. The most ancient inscribed coin known is from nearby Caria. This coin has a Greek legend reading phaenos emi sema interpreted variously as ""I am the badge of Phanes"", or ""I am the sign of light"". The Phanes coins are among the earliest of Greek coins; a hemihekte of the issue was found in the foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (the oldest deposit of electrum coins discovered). One assumption is that Phanes was a mercenary mentioned by Herodotus, another that this coin is associated with the primeval god Phanes or ""Phanes"" might have been an epithet of the local goddess identified with Artemis.  Barclay V. Head found these suggestions unlikely and thought it more probably ""the name of some prominent citizen of Ephesus"".
Another candidate for the site of the earliest coins is Aegina, where Chelone (""turtle"") coins were first minted c. 700 BC. Coins from Athens and Corinth appeared shortly thereafter, known to exist at least since the late 6th century BC.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Antiquity ===


==== Classical Greek antiquity (480 BC~) ====

The Classical period saw Greek coinage reach a high level of technical and aesthetic quality. Larger cities now produced a range of fine silver and gold coins, most bearing a portrait of their patron god or goddess or a legendary hero on one side, and a symbol of the city on the other. Some coins employed a visual pun: some coins from Rhodes featured a rose, since the Greek word for rose is rhodon. The use of inscriptions on coins also began, usually the name of the issuing city.
The wealthy cities of Sicily produced some especially fine coins. The large silver decadrachm (10-drachm) coin from Syracuse is regarded by many collectors as the finest coin produced in the ancient world, perhaps ever. Syracusan issues were rather standard in their imprints, one side bearing the head of the nymph Arethusa and the other usually a victorious quadriga. The tyrants of Syracuse were fabulously rich, and part of their public relations policy was to fund quadrigas for the Olympic chariot race, a very expensive undertaking. As they were often able to finance more than one quadriga at a time, they were frequent victors in this highly prestigious event. Syracuse was one of the epicenters of numismatic art during the classical period. Led by the engravers Kimon and Euainetos, Syracuse produced some of the finest coin designs of antiquity.
Amongst the first centers to produce coins during the Greek colonization of Southern Italy (the so-called ""Magna Graecia"") were Paestum, Crotone, Sybaris, Caulonia, Metapontum, and Taranto. These ancient cities started producing coins from 550 BC to 510 BC.
Amisano, in a general publication, including the Etruscan coinage, attributing it the beginning to c. 560 BC in Populonia, a chronology that would leave out the contribution of the Greeks of Magna Graecia and attribute to the Etruscans the burden of introducing the coin in Italy.  In this work, constant reference is made to classical sources, and credit is given to the origin of the Etruscan Lydia, a source supported by Herodotus, and also to the invention of coin in Lydia.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


==== Appearance of dynastic portraiture (5th century BC) ====

Although many of the first coins illustrated the images of various gods, the first portraiture of actual rulers appears with the coinage of Lycia in the 5th century BC. No ruler had dared illustrating his own portrait on coinage until that time. The Achaemenids had been the first to illustrate the person of their king or a hero in a stereotypical manner, showing a bust or the full body but never an actual portrait, on their Sigloi and Daric coinage from c. 500 BC. A slightly earlier candidate for the first portrait-coin is Themistocles the Athenian general, who became a Governor of Magnesia on the Meander, c. 465–459 BC, for the Achaemenid Empire, although there is some question as to whether his coins may have represented Zeus rather than himself. Themistocles may have been in a unique position in which he could transfer the notion of individual portraiture, already current in the Greek world, and at the same time wield the dynastic power of an Achaemenid dynasty who could issue his own coins and illustrate them as he wished. From the time of Alexander the Great, portraiture of the issuing ruler would then become a standard, generalized, feature of coinage.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


==== Indian coins (c. 400 BC – AD 100) ====

The Karshapana is the earliest punch-marked coin found in India, produced from at least the mid-4th century BC, and possibly as early as 575 BC, influenced by similar coins produced in Gandhara under the Achaemenid empire, such as those of the Kabul hoard, or other examples found at Pushkalavati and in Bhir Mound.


==== Chinese round coins (350 BC~) ====

In China, early round coins appeared in the 4th century BC and were adopted for all China by Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di at the end of 3rd century BC. The round coin, the precursor of the familiar cash coin, circulated in both the spade and knife money areas in the Zhou period, from around 350 BC. Apart from two small and presumably late coins from the State of Qin, coins from the spade money area have a round hole and refer to the jin and liang units. Those from the knife money area have a square hole and are denominated in hua (化).
Although for discussion purposes the Zhou coins are divided up into categories of knives, spades, and round coins, it is apparent from archaeological finds that most of the various kinds circulated together. A hoard found in 1981, near Hebi in north Henan province, consisted of: 3,537 Gong spades, 3 Anyi arched foot spades, 8 Liang Dang Lie spades, 18 Liang square foot spades and 1,180 Yuan round coins, all contained in three clay jars.


==== Hellenistic period (320 BC – AD 30) ====

The Hellenistic period was characterized by the spread of Greek culture across a large part of the known world. Greek-speaking kingdoms were established in Egypt and Syria, and for a time also in Iran and as far east as what is now Afghanistan and northwestern India. Greek traders spread Greek coins across this vast area, and the new kingdoms soon began to produce their own coins. Because these kingdoms were much larger and wealthier than the Greek city states of the classical period, their coins tended to be more mass-produced, as well as larger, and more frequently in gold. They often lacked the aesthetic delicacy of coins of the earlier period.
Still, some of the Greco-Bactrian coins, and those of their successors in India, the Indo-Greeks, are considered the finest examples of Greek numismatic art with ""a nice blend of realism and idealization"", including the largest coins to be minted in the Hellenistic world: the largest gold coin was minted by Eucratides (reigned 171–145 BC), the largest silver coin by the Indo-Greek king Amyntas Nikator (reigned c. 95–90 BC). The portraits ""show a degree of individuality never matched by the often bland depictions of their royal contemporaries further West"" (Roger Ling, ""Greece and the Hellenistic World"").

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


==== Roman period (290 BC~) ====

Coinage followed Greek colonization and influence first around the Mediterranean and soon after to North Africa (including Egypt), Syria, Persia, and the Balkans. Coins came late to the Roman Republic compared with the rest of the Mediterranean, especially Greece and Asia Minor where coins were invented in the 7th century BC. The currency of central Italy was influenced by its natural resources, with bronze being abundant (the Etruscans were famous metal workers in bronze and iron) and silver ore being scarce. The coinage of the Roman Republic started with a few silver coins apparently devised for trade with Celtic in northern Italy and the Greek colonies in Southern Italy, and heavy cast bronze pieces for use in Central Italy. The first Roman coins, which were crude, heavy cast bronzes, were issued c. 289 BC.
Amisano, in a general publication, including the Etruscan coinage, attributing it the beginning to about 550 BC in Populonia, a chronology that would leave out the contribution of the Greeks of Magna Graecia and attribute to the Etruscans the burden of introducing the coin in Italy.  In this work, constant reference is made to classical sources, and credit is given to the origin of the Etruscan Lydia, a source supported by Herodotus, and also to the invention of coin in Lydia.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Middle Ages ===

Charlemagne, in 800 AD, implemented a series of reforms upon becoming ""Holy Roman Emperor"", including the issuance of a standard coin, the silver penny. Between 794 and 1200 the penny was the only denomination of coin in Western Europe. Minted without oversight by bishops, cities, feudal lords and fiefdoms, by 1160, coins in Venice contained only 0.05g of silver, while England's coins were minted at 1.3g. Large coins were introduced in the mid-13th century. In England, a dozen pennies was called a ""shilling"" and twenty shillings a ""pound"": consistent with e.g. France.
Debasement of coin was widespread. There were periods of significant debasement in 1340–60 and 1417–29, when no small coins were minted, and by the 15th century the issuance of small coin was further restricted by government restrictions and even prohibitions. With the exception of the Great Debasement, England's coins were consistently minted from sterling silver (silver content of 92.5%). A lower quality of silver with more copper mixed in, used in Barcelona, was called billon. The first European coin to use Arabic numerals to date the year in which the coin was minted was the St. Gall silver Plappart of 1424.
Italy has been influential at a coinage point of view: the Florentine florin, one of the most used coinage types in European history and one of the most important coins in Western history, was struck in Florence in the 13th century, while the Venetian sequin, minted from 1284 to 1797, was the most prestigious gold coin in circulation in the commercial centers of the Mediterranean Sea. The Florentine florin was the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities since the 7th century to play a significant commercial role. The Florentine florin was used for larger transactions such as those used in dowries, international trade or for tax-related matters.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Modern history ===
Genoese coins became important in the 16th century during the Golden age of Genoese banking, with the Spanish Empire funnelling its massive wealth from Spanish America through the Bank of Saint George. With the decline in the fortunes of the Genoese banks and the Spanish Empire in the 17th century, however, the Genoese lira also depreciated substantially. The silver scudo's value increased to 6.5 lire in 1646, 7.4 lire in 1671, and 8.74 lire just before the Austrian occupation of Genoa in 1746.
Variations in the mass of precious metals used in international trade, particularly in imports of spices and textiles into Europe, explain the numerous monetary reforms that occurred in this period. The effect of these transactions on the available reserves of gold and silver was at the origin of the various monetary reforms, which changed the price of silver compared to gold. Faced with the distinct monetary systems developed by Genoa, Venice or Florence, the widespread use in the 15th century of the silver thaler, of constant size and mass, allowed conversion operations to be limited and therefore exchanges facilitated. The thaler was the monetary unit of the Germanic countries until the 19th century and is considered the ancestor of the United States dollar. At the same time, the Mexican Mint was established on May 11, 1535, by order of the Spanish king following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Opened in April 1536, this mint had the right to mint silver Spanish real which became the basis of the monetary system of the Spanish Empire. Louis XIII had the Louis d'or minted in 1640 to compete with these coins.
The first attested siege coins appeared at the siege of Pavia in 1524. Auxiliary coins consisted, among the Greeks and Romans as in our modern societies, of coins strongly linked to copper. In particular, the red copper alloy was used for its physical properties, suitable for objects constantly subjected to manipulation: malleability, resistance to impacts, wear and corrosion (only gold has better resistance to corrosion). This alloy was often mixed with a little tin, zinc and especially nickel for their anti-corrosive, ductile and anti-fouling properties.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Value ==


=== Currency ===

Most coins presently are made of a base metal, and their value comes from their status as fiat money. This means that the value of the coin is established by law, and thus is determined by the free market only in as much as national currencies are used in domestic trade and also traded in the international market. Thus, these coins are monetary tokens, just as paper currency is: their value is usually not backed by metal, but rather by some form of government guarantee. Thus, there is very little economic difference between notes and coins of equivalent face value.
Coins may be in circulation with face values lower than the value of their component metals, but they are never initially issued with such value, and the shortfall only arises over time due to inflation, as market values for the metal overtake the face value of the coin. Examples are the pre-1965 US dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar (containing slightly less than a tenth, quarter, half, and full ounce of silver, respectively), US nickel, and pre-1982 US penny. As a result of the increase in the value of copper, the United States greatly reduced the amount of copper in each penny. Since mid-1982, United States pennies are made of 97.5% zinc, with the remaining 2.5% being a coating of copper. Extreme differences between face values and metal values of coins cause coins to be hoarded or removed from circulation by illicit smelters in order to realize the value of their metal content. This is an example of Gresham's law. The United States Mint, in an attempt to avoid this, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of pennies and nickels. Violators can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to five years.


=== Collector's items ===

A coin's value as a collector's item or as an investment generally depends on its condition, specific historical significance, rarity, quality, beauty of the design and general popularity with collectors. If a coin is greatly lacking in all of these, it is unlikely to be worth much. The value of bullion coins is also influenced to some extent by those factors, but is largely based on the value of their gold, silver, or platinum content. Sometimes non-monetized bullion coins such as the Canadian Maple Leaf and the American Gold Eagle are minted with nominal face values less than the value of the metal in them, but as such coins are never intended for circulation, these face values have no relevance.
Collector catalogs often include information about coins to assists collectors with identifying and grading. Additional resources can be found online for collectors These are collector clubs, collection management tools, marketplaces, trading platforms, and forums,


=== Media of expression ===

Coins can be used as creative media of expression – from fine art sculpture to the penny machines that can be found in most amusement parks. In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in the United States there are some regulations specific to nickels and pennies that are informative on this topic. 31 CFR § 82.1 forbids unauthorized persons from exporting, melting, or treating any 5 or 1 cent coins.
This has been a particular problem with nickels and dimes (and with some comparable coins in other currencies) because of their relatively low face value and unstable commodity prices. For a while, the copper in US pennies was worth more than one cent, so people would hoard pennies and then melt them down for their metal value. It cost more than face value to manufacture pennies or nickels, so any widespread loss of the coins in circulation could be expensive for the US Treasury. This was more of a problem when coins were still made of precious metals like silver and gold, so strict laws against alteration make more sense historically.
31 CFR § 82.2(b) goes on to state that: ""The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against the treatment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins shall not apply to the treatment of these coins for educational, amusement, novelty, jewelry, and similar purposes as long as the volumes treated and the nature of the treatment makes it clear that such treatment is not intended as a means by which to profit solely from the value of the metal content of the coins.""


=== Debasement and clipping ===

Throughout history, monarchs and governments have often created more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow if the coins were pure metal. By replacing some fraction of a coin's precious metal content with a base metal (often copper or nickel), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby ""debasing"" the money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible. Debasement occasionally occurs in order to make the coin physically harder and therefore less likely to be worn down as quickly, but the more usual reason is to profit from the difference between face value and metal value. Debasement of money almost always leads to price inflation. Sometimes price controls are at the same time also instituted by the governing authority, but historically these have generally proved unworkable.
The United States is unusual in that it has only slightly modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest coin in common circulation is valued at 25 cents, a very low value for the largest denomination coin compared to many other countries. Increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc meant that both the US one- and five-cent coins became worth more for their raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) contained about two cents' worth of copper.
Some denominations of circulating coins that were formerly minted in the United States are no longer made. These include coins with a face value of a half cent, two cents, three cents, and twenty cents. (The half dollar and dollar coins are still produced, but mostly for vending machines and collectors.) In the past, the US also coined the following denominations for circulation in gold: One dollar, $2.50, three dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, and twenty dollars. In addition, cents were originally slightly larger than the modern quarter and weighed nearly half an ounce, while five-cent coins (known then as ""half dimes"") were smaller than a dime and made of a silver alloy. Dollar coins were also much larger, and weighed approximately an ounce. One-dollar gold coins are no longer produced and rarely used. The US also issues bullion and commemorative coins with the following denominations: 50¢, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.
Circulating coins commonly suffered from ""shaving"" or ""clipping"": the public would cut off small amounts of precious metal from their edges to sell it and then pass on the mutilated coins at full value. Unmilled British sterling silver coins were sometimes reduced to almost half their minted weight. This form of debasement in Tudor England was commented on by Sir Thomas Gresham, whose name was later attached to Gresham's law. The monarch would have to periodically recall circulating coins, paying only the bullion value of the silver, and reminting them. This, also known as recoinage, is a long and difficult process that was done only occasionally. Many coins have milled or reeded edges, originally designed to make it easier to detect clipping.


=== Cutting ===
Some coins made of precious metals were manufactured with a cross on one side make it easier to split the coin into halves or quarters.


=== Other uses ===

Some convicted criminals from the British Isles who were sentenced to transportation to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries used coins to leave messages of remembrance to loved ones left behind in Britain. The coins were defaced, smoothed and inscribed, either by stippling or engraving, with sometimes touching words of loss. These coins were called ""convict love tokens"" or ""leaden hearts"". Some of these tokens are in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.


== Modern features ==

The side of a coin carrying an image of a monarch, other authority (see List of people on coins), or a national emblem is called the obverse (colloquially, heads); the other side, carrying various types of information, is called the reverse (colloquially, tails). The year of minting is usually shown on the obverse, although some Chinese coins, most Canadian coins, the pre-2008 British 20p coin, the post-1999 American quarter, and all Japanese coins are exceptions.
The relation of the images on the obverse and reverse of a coin is the coin's orientation",1
Ecotheology,"Ecotheology is a form of constructive theology that focuses on the interrelationships of religion and nature, particularly in the light of environmental concerns. Ecotheology generally starts from the premise that a relationship exists between human religious/spiritual worldviews and the degradation or restoration and preservation of nature. It explores the interaction between ecological values, such as sustainability, and the human domination of nature. The movement has produced numerous religious-environmental projects around the world.
The burgeoning awareness of environmental crisis has led to widespread religious reflection on the human relationship with the earth. Such reflection has strong precedents in most religious traditions in the realms of ethics and cosmology, and can be seen as a subset or corollary to  the theology of nature.
It is important to keep in mind that ecotheology explores not only the relationship between religion and nature in terms of degradation of nature, but also in terms of ecosystem management in general. Specifically, ecotheology seeks not only to identify prominent issues within the relationship between nature and religion, but also to outline potential solutions. This is of particular importance because many supporters and contributors of ecotheology argue that science and education are simply not enough to inspire the change necessary in our current environmental crisis.
There is not a clear distinction between environmental theology and ecotheology, though the term environmental theology might indicate a theology in which environmental ethics is established prior to one's understanding of the meaning of God.


== Background ==
Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a pioneering figure in the field of ecotheology, was among the early thinkers ""to draw attention to the spiritual dimensions of the environmental crisis"" He first presented his insight in a 1965 essay, expanding it in a series of lectures given at the University of Chicago the following year, in May 1966, several months before Lynn White, Jr. gave his famous lecture before the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on December 26, 1966 (published in Science in 1967 as ""The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis""). Nasr’s lectures were later published as Man and Nature: The Spiritual Crisis of Modern Man in 1968 in which he argued, in a detailed manner, ""for the revival of a sacred view of the universe in order to combat the contemporary environmental crisis"". Anna M. Gade states that the ""short and often credited"" article by Lynn White contained ""similar arguments"" made by Nasr in his ""influential"" Rockefeller Series Lectures at the University of Chicago Divinity School, about a year ago. Richard Foltz is also of the view that Nasr's Lectures that ""preceded"" White's 1967 article presented ""similar argument"". Foltz argues that ""Nasr has made the connection between the West's spiritual and environmental crises since the 1950s"" and ""actually anticipated White's critique in his own lectures given at the University of Chicago earlier in the same year as White's address"". Nasr is credited for making ""significant methodological and theoretical contributions to the development of eco-theology"".
The relationship of theology to the modern ecological crisis, however, became an intense issue of debate in Western academia in 1967, following the publication of the article, ""The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis"", by Lynn White Jr., Professor of History at the University of California at Los Angeles. In this work, White puts forward a theory that the Christian model of human dominion over nature has led to environmental devastation, providing a voice for ""The Ecological Complaint"".
In 1973, theologian Jack Rogers published an article in which he surveyed the published studies of approximately twelve theologians which had appeared since White's article. They reflect the search for ""an appropriate theological model"" which adequately assesses the biblical data regarding the relationship between God, humans, and nature.


== Precedents in religious thought ==
Some scholars argue that Christians actually helped bring about the current global environmental crisis by instructing followers that God, and by extension mankind, transcends nature. Much of the development of ecotheology as a theological discourse was in response to this argument, which has been called ""The Ecological Complaint"". Defendants of this perspective essentially claim that Christianity promotes the idea of human dominion over nature, treating nature itself as a tool to be used and even exploited for survival and prosperity.
However, Christianity has often been viewed as the source of positive values towards the environment, and there are many voices within the Christian tradition whose vision embraces the well-being of the earth and all creatures. While Francis of Assisi is one of the more obvious influences on Christian ecotheology, there are many theologians and teachers, such as Isaac of Nineveh and Seraphim of Sarov, whose work has profound implications for Christian thinkers. Many of these are less well known in the West because their primary influence has been on the Orthodox Church rather than the Roman Catholic Church.
The significance of indigenous traditions for the development of ecotheology also cannot be overstated. Systems of Traditional Ecological Knowledge, in combination with modern scientific methods of ecosystem management, are steadily gaining interest as environmental activists realize the importance of locally invested groups.


== Further exploration ==
Christian ecotheology draws on the writings of such authors as Jesuit priest and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, and Passionist priest and historian Thomas Berry. It is well represented in Protestantism by John B. Cobb, Jr.,  Jürgen Moltmann, and Michael Dowd; in ecofeminism by feminist theologians Rosemary Radford Ruether, Catherine Keller, and Sallie McFague; in ecowomanism by Melanie Harris and Karen Baker-Fletcher; in liberation theology by Leonardo Boff and Tink Tinker; in Roman Catholicism by John F. Haught and Pope Francis; and in Orthodoxy by Elizabeth Theokritoff and George Nalunnakkal (currently Bishop Geevarghese Mor Coorilose of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church). Besides works on theology per se, interpreters of the ecological significance of scripture, such as Ellen Davis, also play an important role.
Creation Spirituality is another important expression of ecotheology that has been developed and popularized by Matthew Fox, a former Catholic Dominican friar turned Episcopal priest.
Abraham Joshua Heschel and Martin Buber, both Jewish philosophers, have also left their mark on Christian ecotheology, and provide significant inspiration for Jewish ecotheology. The most recent and most complete expressions of Jewish ecotheology to date can be found in  Rabbi Arthur Ocean Waskow's work on ecotheology in the Hebrew scriptures  and Rabbi David Mevorach Seidenberg's work on Kabbalah and ecology.
Hindu ecotheology includes writers such as Vandana Shiva. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a Perennialist scholar and Persian Sufi philosopher, was one of the earlier Muslim voices calling for a reevaluation of the Western relationship to nature.
Elisabet Sahtouris is an  evolutionary biologist and futurist who promotes a vision she believes will result in the sustainable health and well-being of humanity within the larger living systems of Earth and the cosmos. She is a lecturer in Gaia Theory and a coworker with James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis. Increasingly there are points of reference between Gaianism, environmentalism and the world's major religions.
Annie Dillard, Pulitzer Prize-winning American author, also combined observations on nature and philosophical explorations in several ecotheological writings, including Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.
Terry Tempest Williams is a Mormon writer and conservationist who sensitively and imaginatively explores ecotheology in her very personal writing.
The majority of the content of Indians of the Americas, by former Bureau of Indian Affairs head John Collier, concerns the link between ecological sustainability and religion among Native North and South Americans.
Mark I. Wallace is a self-described Christian animist; his research argues that when God appears in the Bible as a dove, a snake, or the burning bush, that this is a literal transformation rather than a metaphorical one.

Geomorphosite,"A geomorphosite, or geomorphological heritage site, is a landform or an assemblage of landforms that have a scientific, educational, historic-cultural, aesthetic or socio-economic value.

Geomorphosites are included among the geoheritage sites (geosites) and may comprise landforms (or sites of former landforms) that have been hidden or destroyed due to human activities, as well as anthropogenic landforms of archaeological or historical interest.
The value of a geomorphosite, for purposes of analysis, comparison and protection, can be qualitatively assessed using several methods. Some of these methods are based only on expert judgements and a few evaluation criteria, while others involve assigning a qualitative score to each relevant characteristic of a site (e.g. its scientific importance, educational value etc.) and then weighting and summing (or ranking) the scores to obtain the site's overall value (or rank).

Dualism,"Dualism is the idea or theory that something (an object, an idea, or the whole world) is split into two parts. The parts are separate from each other, and the thing cannot be divided up in any other way.
That contrasts with the idea or theory that something cannot be split into any parts, which is called monism, and with the idea or theory that something can be split into many parts, which is called pluralism.
In philosophy, there are many kinds of dualism.

In the philosophy of mind dualism means that the mind and the body are two very different things. Nothing that is part of the body can be part of the mind, and nothing that is part of the mind can be part of the body. People like that sort of dualism because they think that the mind is too important or too strange to be part of the body. A contrasting idea is that the mind and the body are the same thing or that mind is just another word for the brain. (See also René Descartes.)
In epistemology, dualism means that there is a barrier between a person and the world around them. The barrier splits the world into two for that person, into ""myself"" and ""the world."" Each person can see, hear, taste, smell and touch the world but cannot know it directly. For example, somebody cannot know just by looking that things are made up of many atoms. This means that something could happen in the world that we would not know about because we could not see, hear, taste, smell or touch it. A non-dualist idea is that a person is just another part of the world and that there is no barrier. For example, it could be said that if we cannot see, hear, taste, touch or smell something, it does not affect us.
Dualism is also a common sense idea. For example, it is a form of dualism to say that a thing is hot or cold, good or bad, mine or somebody else's. That has no allowance for possible states in between.


== Ditheism ==
In theology, dualism, also called duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism, refers to the doctrine or the belief that there are two independent divine beings or eternal principles: one good and the other evil. Examples of ditheism include Zoroastrianism, Wicca, and Marcionism. The Bible mentions Satan, but that is not ditheism since he is not equal to God but merely an angel (see Jude 6).
Ditheism is not the same as dualism, but they are similar. Ditheism implies (at least) two gods, but moral dualism does not imply any theism (belief in a god). The old dualist religion of the Roma people, Romanipen, is a simple belief in Devla (God) and Beng (Satan).

Pelton wheel,"The pelton wheel is a kind of water turbine. It is used in power plants, to convert a water flow into a movement of a wheel (and then into energy). Lester Alan Pelton invented it in the 1870s. In a regular wheel for example of a mill, the energy is obtained from the weight of the water. A pelton wheel uses the impulse of the water to generate energy, not its weight.  Pelton wheels are used in power plants where there's a big difference in height, but where there is relatively little water. An example might be a dam or barrage in the mountains. One of the drawbacks of a pelton wheel is the relatively hight level of wear:  Unlike the Francis turbine, a pelton wheel cannot be used to pump water.",0
Transmedicalism,"Transmedicalism is when people think that one needs gender dysphoria to be transgender. The people who think this are called transmedicalists. People who disagree with transmedicalists sometimes call them truscum or transmeds.

Heresiology,"In theology or the history of religion, heresiology is the study of heresy, and heresiographies are writings about the topic. Heresiographical works were common in both medieval Christianity and Islam.
Heresiology developed as a part of the emerging definition of Christian orthodoxy. Church scholars studied and documented the teachings of various Christian sects in order to clearly distinguish between those they accepted as orthodox and those they rejected as heretical. Other Christian communions developed their own competing heresiological traditions as well.
In Islam, heresiology surveyed both the various Muslim sects, and also other religions such as Christianity and Judaism. Some, like Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi and Ibn Hazm wrote polemical works, arguing the falseness of sects and religions other than their own. Others, like al-Shahrastani's Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, took a more impartial approach closer to modern religious studies works.

Nanmu,"Nanmu (Chinese: 楠木) is a precious wood that is unique to China and South Asia, and was historically used for boat building, architectural woodworking, furniture and sculptural carving in China. The Ming dynasty-era writings indicate this wood as superior durable softwood. A recent excavation of a tomb in Lija village in Jing'an County, Jiangxi Province, found 47 coffins made of nanmu wood that are reported to be about 2500 years old, dating back to the Eastern Zhou dynasty period and belonging to the Dongyi State of Xu.
The trees that produce nanmu wood are evergreens that have long, straight trunks which grows to 35 meters in height and one meter in diameter. More than 30 varieties exist, which are found south of the Yangtze River. There are also nanmu trees on Hainan Island and in Vietnam. Yangmu nanmu is found in Sichuan. Zinan nanmu is found in southeast and south central China. Zinanmu nanmu is found in Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhenjiang. Zhennan nanmu is found in Guizhou and Sichuan. The finest of all the nanmu woods is Hongmao Nanmu (Phoebe hungmaoensis) from Hainan Island.
Nanmu wood comes from several species of tree, including:

Litsea cubeba
Machilus nanmu
Phoebe hungmaoensis
Phoebe zhennan
It is trees of the Phoebe genus, however, that produce the highest grades of nanmu wood.

Nanmu is a knotty wood that frequently shows a wavy or quilted grain figure. It does not react to humidity and temperature much in the way of expansion or contraction and makes superior furniture which tends not to get loose or crack because of changes in climate. Nanmu woods that are lighter in color and have loose grain are considered inferior.
Nanmu was used in architectural woodworking and boatbuilding due to its resistance to decay. The wood dries with little splitting or warping. After drying the wood is of medium-density and does not change shape. Nanmu can be sanded to a mirror finish. The highest grade of nanmu wood has a bright golden color, a pleasant fragrance, and exhibits impressive chatoyancy (an optical effect) which is why it is often referred to as jīnsī (Chinese: 金絲 - golden-thread or golden silk) in China.
Although recently harvested nanmu and zhennan lumber and newly made articles could still be obtained (at extremely high prices) as recently as 2019, it is officially a protected species in China and worldwide. Due to deforestation, disease, and pollution, these species are almost exhausted. Some small semi-natural forest stands and protected artificial forests still exist, but the trees are otherwise now limited to small growths of aging decorative trees in temples, cottages, parks, and courtyards.

Masapán,"Masapán sculpting is a special craft technique associated with the town of Calderón, Quito in Ecuador. It is an art form from where beautiful and detailed figurines are created from a bread dough mixture. These figurines can be anything from fruits, animals, people, ornaments, nativity scenes, etc.


== History ==
Masapán literally translates into masa (dough) pán (bread). Women in and around the region of Calderón, Ecuador have been making dough art for generations as a holiday tradition. The recipe for the mixture is simple. It is a combination of wheat flour, white glue, and water. This recipe varies from family to family and is kept secret as it is passed down from generation to generation. Beginning around 1940 they began selling their figurines in local shops.


== Technique ==
The dough is hand rolled and sculpted with small tools, knives, and toothpicks. The sharp points of the tools are ideal for the details the figurines are known for. They are then set to air dry for days or weeks before they are meticulously painted.


== Production ==
A skilled artisan can make about 300 figurines in one day. In a month a shop typically makes about 20,000. Prices range between a quarter to $10 depending on the size. They are sold year-round but are extremely popular on November 2, the Day of the Dead and Christmas time. Recently there has a surge of interest in these figurines from people living in the United States and Europe. Many of the shops now spend time filling large orders and exporting the figurines to these countries.",1
Heat pump,"A heat pump is a machine that moves heat from a cold place to a hot place. Examples include:

Refrigerator. It moves heat from the inside to the outside. This keeps the food inside cold, so it will not spoil.
Air conditioner. It moves heat from the inside of a building to the outside.
Peltier device. It moves heat from one side to the other by means of an electric current.
Some buildings are heated with heat pumps, also. In the winter, the heat pump moves heat from the outside to the inside. Sometimes this works better than heating with a radiator.


== How it works ==
Usually, heat flows from a hot place to a cold place, according to the second law of thermodynamics. Heat will not move from a cold place to a warmer place by itself. Because of this, a heat pump must use extra energy to move the heat. This is sort of like pumping water uphill.
Most heat pumps use electric motors to provide energy. Some heat pumps use heat energy, supplied by a flame or an electric heater.

Most heat pumps have a refrigeration cycle using a compressor. A refrigeration cycle uses a fluid which moves through tubes and carries the heat. The fluid is called a refrigerant. During the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid.
When the refrigerant changes from a (compressed) liquid to a gas, it absorbs heat energy from the environment. When the refrigerant changes from a gas back to a liquid, it loses heat energy.
The heat pump is set up so that the refrigerant gains heat from one place that will be cooled, and moves it to another place that will be warmed.
A heat pump forces the refrigerant to change from a gas to a liquid. It uses a compressor to do this. Often, an electric motor drives the compressor. The compressor compresses the refrigerant, and this makes it change from a gas to a liquid. Compressing will heat up the liquid extensively.
At the other end of the cycle, the refrigerant boils again, absorbing heat from its surroundings, it cools them down. So where the refrigerant is changing from a liquid to a gas, it feels cooler.
This is the complete cycle, from the cooling side to the heating side:
On the cooling side, heat is taken up to boil the refrigerant from a liquid to a gas. Then the fluid moves to the heating side.There, the compressor forces the refrigerant back to a liquid again. This makes it give up its heat. So heat has moved from the cooling side to the heating side. Then, the cycle repeats.
If the cooling side is the inside of a refrigerator, it gets cold.
If the cooling side is the inside of a building, and the warming side is the outside of the building, the inside of the building gets cold. This is how an air conditioner works.
If the cooling side is the outside of the building, and the warming side is the inside of the building, this is how a heat pump can heat a building during the winter.


== United Kingdom ==
The British government sees heat pumps as an important part of moving away from fossil fuels.  They want to see 600,000 new heat pumps per year by 2028. There is a grant of £7,500 to help with the cost. In 2024 not many people were fitting them.

XyloTron,"The XyloTron, or simply XyloTron, is a portable wood identification device purposely created to aid in the accurate and rapid identification of round or sawn timber and wood products, in the commercial and market applications. 
It was created in 2023 at the USA in the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) at Madison, Wisconsin by the research team of the leading wood scientist and botanist, Alex C. Wiedenhoeft. This novel device employs advanced imaging hardware and artificial intelligence (AI) software to accurately identify wood species. The system was designed in collaboration with field experts and incorporates custom-designed features tailored for species identification. Its name originates from the prefix, Xylo- (which means wood, in Greek) and –Tron, which implies machine-vision system (see electronics).


== Principle ==
The XyloTron utilizes scientifically validated species models, which were created using high-resolution images from multiple verified wood samples provided by various scientific and industrial partners. These models enable the system to deliver accurate results in both laboratory and field settings. The imaging hardware is designed to be user-friendly, producing consistently high-quality images for analysis. One of the key advantages of the XyloTron is its portability and its versatile ability to function independently of an internet connection, allowing for immediate species identification regardless of location.
The work, which led to this invention in the field of wood science, was actually initiated at FPL in 2018 by Dr. Alex C. Wiedenhoeft and Dr. John C. Hermanson, and later on, the UW expert, Dr. Prabu Ravindran, was highly involved and contributed in its creation.


== Practical uses ==
Timber identification that is both quick and accurate is essential -today- for preventing the entry of illegal wood products into global supply chains. The XyloTron is an affordable, field-portable wood species identification system designed to assist users (governmental, commercial, scientific) worldwide in identifying wood species with an accuracy rate of approximately 98-100 %. 
This tool enables immediate and reliable identification, contributing to the global effort to combat illegal logging and the trade of unauthorized timber.

Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search,"The Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search, or SWEEPS, was an astronomical survey. It was carried out in 2006. SWEEPS used the Hubble Space Telescope to look at 180,000 stars for seven days to find extrasolar planets.


== Area looked at ==

The stars that SWEEPS monitored were all in the Sagittarius-I Window. This is a rare transparent look at the huge group of closely packed stars at the Milky Way's centre (central bulge), in the Sagittarius constellation. Our view to most of the stars in the centre of the galaxy is blocked by lanes of dust. These stars are about 27,000 light years from Earth.


== Planets discovered ==
Sixteen planets were discovered by SWEEPS. They took from 0.6 to 4.2 days to go around the Sun. Planets which took less than 1.2 days to go around the sun have not been detected yet; these have been called ""ultra-short period planets"" (USPPs) by the search team. USPPs were discovered only around stars with a low mass. This means that larger stars might have destroyed any planets orbiting so closely, or that planets could not move as far inward around larger stars.
SWEEPS-4 and SWEEPS-11 orbited stars that were very different to other stars close by. This made it possible for these to be looked at again using the radial velocity method. Their masses could then be found.

Estovers,"In English law, an estover is an allowance made to a person out of an estate, or other thing, for his or her support. The word estover can also mean specifically an allowance of wood that a tenant is allowed to take from the commons, for life or a period of years, for the implements of husbandry, hedges and fences, and for firewood.


== History ==
The word derives from the French estover, estovoir, a verb used as a substantive meaning ""that which is necessary"". This word is of disputed origin; it has been referred to the Latin stare, to stand, or studere, to desire.
The Old English word for estover was bote or boot, also spelled bot or bót, (literally meaning 'good' or 'profit' and cognate with the word better). The various kinds of estovers were known as house-bote, cart or plough-bote, hedge or hay-bote, and fire-bote. Anglo-Saxon law also imposed ""bot"" fines in the modern sense of compensation. These rights might be restricted by express covenants. Copyholders had similar rights over the land they occupied and over the waste of the manor, in which case the rights are known as Commons of estovers.
Burrill in his dated A law dictionary and glossary published in New York (1871) states:

ESTOVER. L. Fr. and Eng. [L. Lat estoverium.] An allowance made to a person. See Estoverium. The plural only (estovers) is now used. See Estovers.
...
ESTOVERS. L.Fr. and Eng. [L. Lat. estoveria and more anciently estoverium; from Fr. estouver', estover, or estoffer, to furnish, supply or maintain.]
An allowance  made to a person out of an estate, or other thing for his or her support, as for food and  raiment, (in victu et vestitu). Stat, Gloc. 
c. 4. See Estover, Estoverium. An allowance (more commonly called alimony,) granted to a woman divorced a mensa et thoro, for her support out of her husband's estate. 1 Bl Com. 441.
An allowance of wood made to a tenant for life or years; a liberty of taking necessary wood for the use or furniture of his house or farm from off the land demised to him. 2 Bl Com. 35. 1 Steph. Com. 241, 260. 2 Crabb's Real Prop. 76, § 1044. Bisset on Estates, 276, 277. 4 Kenf's Com. 73. This is the ordinary meaning of the word estovers which are also called in law botes embracing the various kinds of house-bote fire-bote plough-bote and hay-bote See Botes. Estovers are sometimes erroneously confounded with common of estavers (q. v.) and the distinction is not clearly made by Britton in his 60th chapter, De renables estovers.

Tylosis (botany),"In woody plants, a tylosis (plural: tyloses) is a bladder-like distension of a parenchyma cell into the lumen of adjacent vessels. The term tylosis summarises the physiological process and the resulting occlusion in the xylem of woody plants as response to injury or as protection from decay in heartwood. 
It is a key process in wall one of the compartmentalization of decay in trees (CODIT) and other woody plants.


== Anatomy ==
Observed in section under a microscope, tyloses appear as balloon-like protrusions emanating from axial paratracheal parenchyma cells into xylem vessels through pits linking the two. In some types, there may be a distinct barrier between the tyloses emanating from the pits into the vessels, while they may be barely distinguishable in other cases.


== Tyloses ==

Tyloses are outgrowths on parenchyma cells of xylem vessels of secondary heartwood. When the plant is stressed by drought or infection, tyloses will fall from the sides of the cells and ""dam"" up the vascular tissue to prevent further damage to the plant.
Tyloses can aid in the process of making sapwood into heartwood in some hardwood trees, especially in trees with larger vessels. These blockages can be used in addition to gum plugs as soon as vessels become filled with air bubbles, and they help to form a stronger heartwood by slowing the progress of rot.


== Role in compartmentalization ==
Tylosis in the vessels of flowering plants counteracts the axial spread of fungal hyphae and other pathogens by slowing down their vertical spread with a physical barrier. A similar process occurs in gymnosperms, which block access to tracheids by closing the pits that join them to each other.
The blocked vessels also provide a defense against the radial spread of pathogens, limiting their horizontal spread through the plant stem. Protection is stronger at the boundaries where annual rings meet.
The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal barriers is affected by the speed at which they are established by tyloses, being typically faster in healthier plants.


== Role in heartwood formation ==
As a tree grows, its cambium adds an annual increment (or ring) of new wood, and in many species of trees the older wood towards the centre of the tree becomes less important for physiological processes like water and nutrient transportation, and this is converted by the tree to heartwood. This heartwood has no active defenses against infection, but is protected from infection and decay by the blockage of the xylem vessels with tyloses and various substances such as gums, resins and waxes containing high concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as terpenes that are toxic to insect larvae and tree pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. These products are produced by the cambium and transported to the centre of the stem by cellular structures called medullary rays radiating from the center of the stem  and then enter living axial paratracheal parenchyma cells. As the wood ages, the contents of the parenchyma cell burst into the dead vessel through the pit linking the two. The parenchyma cell then dies as its contents are disgorged into the empty space of the dry vessel and highly effective decay-inhibiting substances, notably tannin, are formed and absorbed by the adjacent vessel walls.

Oak,"An oak is a hardwood tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family. They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne within a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; it includes some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen. Fossil oaks date back to the Middle Eocene. Molecular phylogeny shows that the genus is divided into Old World and New World clades, but many oak species hybridise freely, making the genus's history difficult to resolve.
Ecologically, oaks are keystone species in habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They live in association with many kinds of fungi including truffles. Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillar, many kinds of gall wasp which form distinctive galls, roundish woody lumps such as the oak apple, and a large number of pests and diseases. Oak leaves and acorns contain enough tannin to be toxic to cattle, but pigs are able to digest them safely. Oak timber is strong and hard, and has found many uses in construction and furniture-making. The bark was traditionally used for tanning leather. Wine barrels are made of oak; these are used for aging alcoholic beverages such as sherry and whisky, giving them a range of flavours, colours, and aromas. The spongy bark of the cork oak is used to make traditional wine bottle corks. Almost a third of oak species are threatened with extinction due to climate change, invasive pests, and habitat loss.
In culture, the oak tree is a symbol of strength and serves as the national tree of many countries. In Indo-European and related religions, the oak is associated with thunder gods. Individual oak trees of cultural significance include the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica Oak in the Basque Country.


== Etymology ==
The generic name Quercus is Latin for ""oak"", derived from Proto-Indo-European *kwerkwu-, ""oak"", which is also the origin of the name ""fir"", another important or sacred tree in Indo-European culture. The word ""cork"", for the bark of the cork oak, similarly derives from Quercus. The common name ""oak"" is from Old English ac (seen in placenames such as Acton, from ac + tun, ""oak village""), which in turn is from Proto-Germanic *aiks, ""oak"".


== Description ==
Oaks are hardwood (dicotyledonous) trees, deciduous or evergreen, with spirally arranged leaves, often with lobate margins; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both staminate ('male') flowers in the form of catkins, and small pistillate ('female') flowers, meaning that the trees are monoecious. The fruit is a nut called an acorn, borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn usually contains one seed and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on the species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid, which helps to guard against fungi and insects. There are some 500 extant species of oaks.
Trees in the genus are often large and slow-growing; Q. alba can reach an age of 600 years, a diameter of 13 feet (4.0 m) and a height of 145 feet (44 m). The Granit oak in Bulgaria, a Q. robur specimen, has an estimated age of 1637 years, making it the oldest oak in Europe. The Wi'aaSal tree, a live oak in the reservation of the Pechanga Band of Indians, California, is at least 1000 years old, and might be as much as 2000 years old, which would make it the oldest oak in the US. Among the smallest oaks is Q. acuta, the Japanese evergreen oak. It forms a bush or small tree to a height of some 30 feet (9.1 m).

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Distribution ==

The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America has the largest number of oak species, with approximately 160 species in Mexico, of which 109 are endemic, and about 90 in the United States. The second greatest area of oak diversity is China, with approximately 100 species.
In the Americas, Quercus is widespread from Vancouver and Nova Scotia in the south of Canada, south to Mexico and across the whole of the eastern United States. It is present in a small area of the west of Cuba; in Mesoamerica it occurs mainly above 1000 metres. The genus crossed the isthmus of Panama when the northern and southern continents came together and is present as one species, Q. humboldtii, above 1000 metres in Colombia. The oaks of North America are of many sections (Protobalanus, Lobatae, Ponticae, Quercus, and Virentes) along with related genera such as Notholithocarpus.
In the Old World, oaks of section Quercus extend across the whole of Europe including European Russia apart from the far north, and north Africa (north of the Sahara) from Morocco to Libya. In Mediterranean Europe, they are joined by oaks of the sections Cerris and Ilex, which extend across Turkey, the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, while section Ponticae is endemic to the western Caucasus in Turkey and Georgia. Oaks of section Cyclobalanopsis extend in a narrow belt along the Himalayas to cover mainland and island Southeast Asia as far as Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Palawan. Finally, oaks of multiple sections (Cyclobalanopsis, Ilex, Cerris, Quercus and related genera like Lithocarpus and Castanopsis) extend across east Asia including China, Korea, and Japan.


== Evolution ==


=== Fossil history ===
Potential records of Quercus have been reported from Late Cretaceous deposits in North America and East Asia. These are not considered definitive, as macrofossils older than the Paleogene, and possibly from before the Eocene are mostly poorly preserved without critical features for certain identification. Amongst the oldest unequivocal records of Quercus are pollen from Austria, dating to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, around 55 million years ago. The oldest records of Quercus in North America are from Oregon, dating to the Middle Eocene, around 44 million years ago, with the oldest records in Asia from the Middle Eocene of Japan; both forms have affinities to the Cyclobalanopsis group.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== External phylogeny ===
Quercus forms part, or rather two parts, of the Quercoideae subfamily of the Fagaceae, the beech family. Modern molecular phylogenetics suggests the following relationships:


=== Internal phylogeny ===
Molecular techniques for phylogenetic analysis show that the genus Quercus consisted of Old World and New World clades. The entire genome of Quercus robur (the pedunculate oak) has been sequenced, revealing an array of mutations that may underlie the evolution of longevity and disease resistance in oaks. In addition, hundreds of oak species have been compared (at RAD-seq loci), allowing a detailed phylogeny to be constructed. However, the high signal of introgressive hybridization (the transfer of genetic material by repeated backcrossing with hybrid offspring) in the genus has made it difficult to resolve an unambiguous, unitary history of oaks. The phylogeny from Hipp et al. 2019 is:


=== Taxonomy ===


==== Taxonomic history ====
The genus Quercus was circumscribed by Carl Linnaeus in the first edition of his 1753 Species Plantarum. He described 15 species within the new genus, providing type specimens for 10 of these, and giving names but no types for Q. cerris, Q. coccifera, Q. ilex, Q. smilax, and Q. suber. He chose Q. robur, the pedunculate oak, as the type species for the genus.
A 2017 classification of Quercus, based on multiple molecular phylogenetic studies, divided the genus into two subgenera and eight sections:

Subgenus Quercus – the New World clade (or high-latitude clade), mostly native to North America
Section Lobatae Loudon – North American red oaks
Section Protobalanus (Trelease) O.Schwarz – North American intermediate oaks
Section Ponticae Stef. – with a disjunct distribution between western Eurasia and western North America
Section Virentes Loudon – American southern live oaks
Section Quercus – white oaks from North America and Eurasia
Subgenus Cerris Oerst.  – the Old World clade (or mid-latitude clade), exclusively native to Eurasia
Section Cyclobalanopsis Oerst. – cycle-cup oaks of East Asia
Section Cerris Dumort. – cerris oaks of subtropical and temperate Eurasia and North Africa
Section Ilex Loudon – ilex oaks of tropical and subtropical Eurasia and North Africa
The subgenus division supports the evolutionary diversification of oaks among two distinct clades: the Old World clade (subgenus Cerris), including oaks that diversified in Eurasia; and the New World clade (subgenus Quercus), oaks that diversified mainly in the Americas.


==== Subgenus Quercus ====

Sect. Lobatae (synonym Erythrobalanus), the red oaks of North America, Central America and northern South America. Styles are long; the acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The actual nut is encased in a thin, clinging, papery skin. The leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with spiny bristles at the lobe.
Sect. Protobalanus, the canyon live oak and its relatives, in the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico. Styles are short; the acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.
Sect. Ponticae, a disjunct including just two species. Styles are short, and the acorns mature in 12 months. The leaves have large stipules, high secondary veins, and are highly toothed.
Sect. Virentes, the southern live oaks of the Americas. Styles are short, and the acorns mature in 12 months. The leaves are evergreen or subevergreen.
Sect. Quercus (synonyms Lepidobalanus and Leucobalanus), the white oaks of Europe, Asia and North America. Trees or shrubs that produce nuts, specifically acorns, as fruits. Acorns mature in one year for annual trees and two years for biannual trees. Acorn is encapsulated by a spiny cupule as characterized by the family Fagaceae. Flowers in the Quercus genera produce one flower per node, with three or six styles, as well as three or six ovaries, respectively. The leaves mostly lack a bristle on their lobe tips, which are usually rounded. The type species is Quercus robur.


==== Subgenus Cerris ====

The type species is Quercus cerris.

Sect. Cyclobalanopsis, the ring-cupped oaks of eastern and southeastern Asia. These are evergreen trees growing 10–40 metres (33–131 feet) tall. They are distinct from subgenus Quercus in that they have acorns with distinctive cups bearing concrescent rings of scales; they commonly also have densely clustered acorns, though this does not apply to all of the species. Species of Cyclobalanopsis are common in the evergreen subtropical laurel forests, which extend from southern Japan, southern Korea, and Taiwan across southern China and northern Indochina to the eastern Himalayas, in association with trees of the genus Castanopsis and the laurel family (Lauraceae).
Sect. Cerris, the Turkey oak and its relatives of Europe and Asia. Styles are long; acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn's shell is hairless. Its leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.
Sect. Ilex, the Ilex oak and its relatives of Eurasia and northern Africa. Styles are medium-long; acorns mature in 12–24 months, appearing hairy on the inside. The leaves are evergreen, with bristle-like extensions on the teeth.


== Ecology ==

Oaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. They are important components of hardwood forests; some species grow in associations with members of the Ericaceae in oak–heath forests. Several kinds of truffles, including two well-known varieties – black Périgord truffle and the white Piedmont truffle – have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. Similarly, many other fungi, such as Ramaria flavosaponaria, associate with oaks.
Oaks support more than 950 species of caterpillars, an important food source for many birds. Mature oak trees shed widely varying numbers of acorns (known collectively as mast) annually, with large quantities in mast years. This may be a predator satiation strategy, increasing the chance that some acorns will survive to germination.

Animals including squirrels and jays – Eurasian jays in the Old World, blue jays in North America – feed on acorns, and are important agents of seed dispersal as they carry the acorns away and bury many of them as food stores. However, some species of squirrel selectively excise the embryos from the acorns that they store, meaning that the food store lasts longer and that the acorns will never germinate.


=== Hybridisation ===

Interspecific hybridization is quite common among oaks, but usually between species within the same section only, and most common in the white oak group. White oaks cannot discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section. Because they are wind pollinated and have weak internal barriers to hybridization, hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring. Ecological stresses, especially near habitat margins, can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species.
Frequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world; most notably, hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with much introgression and the evolution of new species. Introgression has caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information. As a result, genetic data often does not differentiate between clearly morphologically distinct species, but instead differentiates populations. The maintenance of particular loci for adaptation to ecological niches may explain the retention of species identity despite significant gene flow.
The Fagaceae, or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a slowly-evolving clade compared to other angiosperms, and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in Quercus pose a significant challenge to the concept of a species as a group of ""actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups."" By this definition, many species of Quercus would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and genetic data.


=== Diseases and pests ===

Oaks are affected by a large number of pests and diseases. For instance, Q. robur and Q. petraea in Britain host 423 insect species. This diversity includes 106 macro-moths, 83 micro-moths, 67 beetles, 53 cynipoidean wasps, 38 heteropteran bugs, 21 auchenorrhynchan bugs, 17 sawflies, and 15 aphids. The insect numbers are seasonal: in spring, chewing insects such as caterpillars become numerous, followed by insects with sucking mouthparts such as aphids, then by leaf miners, and finally by gall wasps such as Neuroterus. Several powdery mildews affect oak species. In Europe, the species Erysiphe alphitoides is the most common. It reduces the ability of leaves to photosynthesize, and infected leaves are shed early.
Another significant threat, the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea), has emerged in the UK since 2006. The caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees and are hazardous to human health; their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems. A little-understood disease of mature oaks, acute oak decline, has affected the UK since 2009. 
In California, goldspotted oak borer (Agrilus auroguttatus) has destroyed many oak trees, while sudden oak death, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, has devastated oaks in California and Oregon, and is present in Europe. Japanese oak wilt, caused by the fungus Raffaelea quercivora, has rapidly killed trees across Japan.


=== Gall communities ===

Many galls are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, and roots. Examples are oak artichoke gall, oak marble gall, oak apple gall, knopper gall, and spangle gall. These galls are the handiwork of tiny wasps from the  Cynipidae. In a complex ecological relationship, these gall wasps become hosts to parasitoid wasps—primarily from the order Chalcidoidea—which lay their larvae inside the gall wasps, ultimately leading to the hosts' demise. Additionally, inquilines live commensally within the galls without harming the gall wasps.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Toxicity ==
The leaves and acorns of oaks are poisonous to livestock, including cattle and horses, if eaten in large amounts, due to the toxin tannic acid, which causes kidney damage and gastroenteritis. An exception is the domestic pig, which, under the right conditions, may be fed entirely on acorns, and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish dehesa and the English system of pannage). Humans can eat acorns after leaching out the tannins in water.


== Uses ==


=== Timber ===

Oak timber is a strong and hard wood with many uses, such as for furniture, floors, building frames, and veneers.
The wood of a red oak Quercus cerris (the Turkey oak) has better mechanical properties than those of the white oaks Q. petraea and Q. robur; the heartwood and sapwood have similar mechanical properties. Of the North American red oaks, the northern red oak, Quercus rubra, is highly prized for lumber.
The wood is resistant to insect and fungal attack.
Wood from Q. robur and Q. petraea was used in Europe for shipbuilding, especially of naval men of war, until the 19th century. In hill states of India such as Uttarakhand, along with being used for fuelwood and timber, oak wood is used for agricultural implements, while the leaves serve as fodder for livestock during lean periods.


=== Other traditional products ===
Oak bark, with its high tannin content, was traditionally used in the Old World for tanning leather. Oak galls were used for centuries as a main ingredient in iron gall ink for manuscripts, harvested at a specific time of year. In Korea, sawtooth oak bark is used to make shingles for traditional roof construction. The dried bark of the white oak was used in traditional medical preparations; its tannic acid content made it astringent and antiseptic. Acorns have been ground to make a flour, and roasted for acorn coffee.


=== Culinary ===
Barrels for aging wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy and Scotch whisky are made from oak, with single barrel malt whiskies fetching a premium. The use of oak in wine adds a range of flavours. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to their contents' colour, taste, and aroma, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour. A dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give greater refinement and are chosen for the best, most expensive wines. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces a more powerful bouquet.
Oak wood chips are used for smoking foods such as fish, meat, and cheese. 
In Japan, Children's Day is celebrated with Kashiwa-mochi rice cakes, filled with a sweet red bean paste, and wrapped in a kashiwa oak leaf.
The bark of the cork oak is used to produce cork stoppers for wine bottles. This species grows around the Mediterranean Sea; Portugal, Spain, Algeria, and Morocco produce most of the world's supply.
Acorns of various oak species have been used as food for millennia, in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and among the native peoples of North America. In North Africa, acorns have been pressed to make acorn oil: the oil content can be as high as 30%. Oaks have also been used as fodder, both leaves and acorns being fed to livestock such as pigs. Given their high tannin content, acorns have often been leached to remove tannins before use as fodder.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Conservation ==
An estimated 31% of the world's oak species are threatened with extinction, while 41% of oak species are considered to be of conservation concern. The countries with the highest numbers of threatened oak species (as of 2020) are China with 36 species, Mexico with 32 species, Vietnam with 20 species, and the US with 16 species. Leading causes are climate change and invasive pests in the US, and deforestation and urbanization in Asia. 
In the Himalayan region of India, oak forests are being invaded by pine trees due to global warming. The associated pine forest species may cross frontiers and integrate into the oak forests. 
Over the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America, and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood, and charcoal. In the US, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests. However, disturbance-tolerant oaks may have benefited from grazers like bison, and suffered when the bison were removed following European colonization.

=== Symbols ===

The oak is a widely used symbol of strength and endurance. It is the national tree of many countries, including the US, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus (golden oak), Estonia, France, Germany, Moldova, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Wales. Ireland's fifth-largest city, Derry, is named for the tree, from Irish: Doire, meaning 'oak'.  Oak branches are displayed on some German coins, both of the former Deutsche Mark and the euro.
Oak leaves symbolize rank in armed forces including those of the United States. Arrangements of oak leaves, acorns, and sprigs indicate different branches of the United States Navy staff corps officers. The oak tree is used as a symbol by several political parties and organisations. It is the symbol of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, and formerly of the Progressive Democrats in Ireland.


=== Religion ===

The prehistoric Indo-European tribes worshiped the oak and connected it with a thunder god, and this tradition descended to many classical cultures. In Greek mythology, the oak is the tree sacred to Zeus, king of the gods. In Zeus's oracle in Dodona, Epirus, the sacred oak was the centerpiece of the precinct, and the priests would divine the pronouncements of the god by interpreting the rustling of the oak's leaves. Mortals who destroyed such trees were said to be punished by the gods since the ancient Greeks believed beings called hamadryads inhabited them. In Norse and Baltic mythology, the oak was sacred to the thunder gods Thor and Perkūnas respectively. In Celtic polytheism, the name druid, Celtic priest, is connected to Proto-Indo-European *deru, meaning oak or tree. Veneration of the oak survives in Serbian Orthodox Church tradition. Christmas celebrations include the badnjak, a branch taken from a young and straight oak ceremonially felled early on Christmas Eve morning, similar to a yule log.


=== History ===

Category: Individual oak trees
Several oak trees hold cultural importance; such as the Royal Oak in Britain, the Charter Oak in the United States, and the Guernica oak in the Basque Country. ""The Proscribed Royalist, 1651"", a famous painting by John Everett Millais, depicts a Royalist hiding in an oak tree while fleeing from Cromwell's forces.
In the Roman Republic, a crown of oak leaves was given to those who had saved the life of a citizen in battle; it was called the ""Civic Crown"". In his 17th century poem The Garden, Andrew Marvell critiqued the desire to be awarded such a leafy crown: ""How vainly men themselves amaze / To win the palm, the oak, or bays; And their uncessant labors see / Crowned from some single herb or tree, ...""

Generalized renewal process,"In the mathematical theory of probability, a generalized renewal process (GRP)  or G-renewal process is a stochastic point process used to model failure/repair behavior of repairable systems in reliability engineering. Poisson point process is a particular case of GRP.


== Probabilistic model ==


=== Virtual age ===
The G-renewal process is introduced by Kijima and Sumita through the notion of the virtual age.

    {\displaystyle y_{i}=qt_{i}}
  

where:

  
    
      
        
          t
          
            i

            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{i}}
  
 is real and virtual age (respectively) of the system at/after the ith repair,

  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  
 is the restoration factor (a.k.a., repair effectiveness factor),

  
    
      
        q
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=0}
  
, represents the condition of a perfect repair, where the system age is reset to zero after the repair. This condition corresponds to the Ordinary Renewal Process.

  
    
      
        q
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=1}
  
, represents the condition of a minimal repair, where the system condition after the repair remains the same as right before the repair. This condition corresponds to the Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process.

  
    
      
        0
        <
        q
        <
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0<q<1}
  
, represents the condition of a general repair, where the system condition is between perfect repair and minimal repair. This condition corresponds to the Generalized Renewal Process.
Kaminskiy and Krivtsov  extended the Kijima models by allowing q > 1, so that the repair damages (ages) the system to a higher degree than it was just before the respective failure.


=== G-renewal equation ===
Mathematically, the G-renewal process is quantified through the solution of the G-renewal equation:

A closed-form solution to the G-renewal equation is not possible. Also, numerical approximations are difficult to obtain due to the recurrent infinite series. A Monte Carlo based approach to solving the G-renewal Equation was developed by Kaminiskiy and Krivtsov.


== Statistical estimation ==
The G–renewal process gained its practical popularity in reliability engineering only after methods for estimating its parameters had become available.


=== Monte Carlo approach ===
The nonlinear LSQ estimation of the G–renewal process was first offered by Kaminskiy & Krivtsov. A random inter-arrival time from a parameterized G-Renewal process is given by:

  
    
      
        
          X
          
            i

 is a uniformly distributed random variable,

  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  
 is the CDF of the underlying failure-time distribution.
The Monte Carlo solution was subsequently improved and implemented as a web resource.


=== Maximum likelihood approach ===
The maximum likelihood procedures were subsequently discussed by Yañez, et al., and Mettas & Zhao. The estimation of the G–renewal restoration factor was addressed in detail by Kahle & Love.


=== Regularization method in estimating GRP parameters ===
The estimation of G–renewal process parameters is an ill–posed inverse problem, and therefore, the solution may not be unique and is sensitive to the input data. Krivtsov & Yevkin suggested first to estimate the underlying distribution parameters using the time to first failures only. Then, the obtained parameters are used as the initial values for the second step, whereat all model parameters (including the restoration factor(s)) are estimated simultaneously. This approach allows, on the one hand, to avoid irrelevant solutions (wrong local maximums or minimums of the objective function) and on the other hand, to improve computational speed, as the number of iterations significantly depends on the selected initial values.


== Limitations ==
One limitation of the Generalized Renewal Process is that it cannot account for ""better-than-new"" repair.  The G1-renewal process has been developed which applies the restoration factor to the life parameter of a location-scale distribution to be able to account for ""better-than-new"" repair in addition to other repair types.

Gas compressor,"A gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. Compression of a gas naturally increases its temperature. When the gas is air, the machine is called an air compressor.
Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible, so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids.


== Types of compressors ==
There are many different types of gas compressors. The two primary categories are:

Positive displacement compressors with two sub-categories:
Reciprocating
Rotary
Dynamic compressors also with two sub-categories:
Centrifugal
Axial
The more important types in each of the four sub-categories are discussed below.


=== Centrifugal compressors ===

Centrifugal compressors use a vaned rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller, increasing the velocity of the gas. A diffuser (divergent duct) section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy. They are primarily used for continuous, stationary service in industries such as oil refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants. Their application can be from 100 hp (75 kW) to thousands of horsepower. With multiple staging, they can achieve extremely high output pressures greater than 10,000 psi (69 MPa).
Many large snow-making operations (like a ski resort) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as superchargers and turbochargers. Centrifugal compressors are used in small gas turbine engines or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.


=== Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors ===
Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to the axial direction. The diagonal compressor has a lower diameter diffuser than the equivalent centrifugal compressor.


=== Axial-flow compressors ===

Axial-flow compressors use a series of fan-like rotating rotor blades to progressively compress the gasflow. Stationary stator vanes, located downstream of each rotor, redirect the flow onto the next set of rotor blades. The area of the gas passage diminishes through the compressor to maintain a roughly constant axial Mach number. Axial-flow compressors are normally used in high flow applications, such as medium to large gas turbine engines. They are almost always multi-staged. Beyond about 4:1 design pressure ratio, variable geometry is often used to improve operation.


=== Reciprocating compressors ===
Reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30 horsepower (hp) are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty. Larger reciprocating compressors up to 1000 hp are still commonly found in large industrial applications, but their numbers are declining as they are replaced by various other types of compressors. Discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure (>5000 psi or 35 MPa). In certain applications, such as air compression, multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available, and are typically larger, noisier, and more costly than comparable rotary units.


=== Rotary screw compressors ===
Rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive-displacement helical screws to force the gas into a smaller space. These are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable. Their application can be from 3 hp (2.24 kW) to over 500 hp (375 kW) and from low pressure to very high pressure (>1200 psi or 8.3 MPa). They are commonly seen with roadside repair crews powering air-tools. This type is also used for many automobile engine superchargers because it is easily matched to the induction capacity of a piston engine. It's a type of positive displacement gas compression.


=== Scroll compressors ===

A scroll compressor, also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump, uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to pump or compress fluids such as liquids and gases. The vane geometry may be involute, archimedean spiral, or hybrid curves. They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors.
Often, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.


=== Diaphragm compressors ===
A diaphragm compressor (also known as a membrane compressor) is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in touch with the gas being compressed.
Diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas (CNG) as well as in a number of other applications.


=== Miscellany ===
Air compressors sold to and used by the general public are often attached on top of a tank for holding the pressurized air. Oil-lubricated and oil-free compressors are available. Oil-free compressors are desirable because without a properly designed separator, oil can make its way into the air stream. For some purposes, for example as a diving air compressor, even a little oil in the air stream may be unacceptable.


== Temperature ==
Charles's law says ""when a gas is compressed, temperature is raised"". There are three possible relationships between temperature and pressure in a volume of gas undergoing compression:

Isothermal - gas remains at constant temperature throughout the process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion is favored by a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). With practical devices, isothermal compression is usually not attainable. For example, even a bicycle tire-pump gets hot during use.
Adiabatic - In this process there is no heat transfer to or from the system, and all supplied work is added to the internal energy of the gas, resulting in increases of temperature and pressure. Theoretical temperature rise is T2 = T1·Rc((k-1)/k)), with T1 and T2 in degrees Rankine or kelvins, and k = ratio of specific heats (approximately 1.4 for air). The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion is favored by good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow, as to make a perfect adiabatic system would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of a machine.
Polytropic - This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Cycle efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic).


== Staged compression ==
Since compression generates heat, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers cause condensation meaning water separators with drain valves are present. The compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan.
For instance in a typical diving compressor, the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 x 7 x 7 = 343 Atmospheres).


== Applications ==
Gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:

in pipeline transport of purified natural gas to move the gas from the production site to the consumer.
in petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants for compressing intermediate and end product gases.
in refrigeration and air conditioner equipment to move heat from one place to another in refrigerant cycles: see Vapor-compression refrigeration.
in gas turbine systems to compress the intake combustion air
in storing purified or manufactured gases in a small volume, high pressure cylinders for medical, welding and other uses.
in many various industrial, manufacturing and building processes to power all types of pneumatic tools.
as a medium for transferring energy, such as to power pneumatic equipment.
in pressurised aircraft to provide a breathable atmosphere of higher than ambient pressure.
in some types of jet engines (such as turbojets and turbofans) to provide the air required for combustion of the engine fuel. The power to drive the combustion air compressor comes from the jet's own turbines.
in SCUBA diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and other life support devices to store breathing gas in a small volume such as in diving cylinders .
in submarines to store air for later use as buoyancy.
in turbochargers and superchargers to increase the performance of internal combustion engines by concentrating oxygen.
in rail and heavy road transport to provide compressed air for operation of brakes and various other systems (doors, windscreen wipers, engine/gearbox control, etc.).
in miscellaneous uses such as providing compressed air for filling pneumatic tires.

Numerical weather prediction,"Numerical weather prediction is the way weather forecasts are made.  This is done using computer models of the atmosphere. Such models describe the current weather conditions, and how they change over time using equations. Using the current weather conditions, the equations can be solved, or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future. The relevant physical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, the direction and the speed of the wind are taken to be functions of time. These are modelled with a system of partial differential equations. This is a dynamic system that is solved numerically. Most of these equations are implemented using FORTRAN. The equations are approximated. Since the number of calculations is huge, supercomputers usually do them, to finish before it's too late. 


== Basic idea ==
The atmosphere is modelled as a fluid. The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time. The equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics can then be used to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future.


== Local weather prediction ==
The results are usually too inaccurate to be used for predicting the weather at any place. For this reason, meteorologists check the values, and compare them to historical data. In other words, they use the data to help produce the weather forecast.
Model Output Statistics is a statistical model that was developed in the 1960s and 1970s. It uses regression analysis for a fully automated forecast. With it, historical data is analysed automatically. One of its applications is called Direct Model Output. MOS uses both historical data and statistical modeling. Predictions beyond about six hours are unreliable. 
Another well-known model is called Global Forecast System (GFS), which is run by the US weather service, NOAA. It gives a forecast four times a day. Since the information is free, the GFS is often used, especially by smaller weather stations.


== Ensembles ==
The atmosphere is a chaotic system. A small change of the input values does not necessarily lead to a small change of the output. This is due to the equations of fluid dynamics that are involved. These equations involved are solved or approximated once with the parameters that were observed. This is done several times more, with parameters that are based on the observed values, but which have been changed slightly. Because the computing power is limited, the ""resolution"" of such a model is more coarse. Once all the calculations are finished, they are compared to one another. Calculated results that are ""similar"" indicate that the prognosis is relatively good. In some cases, this means that it is possible to accurately predict the weather for a time of about ten days; in other cases a prediction over even a few days may be difficult.

Universal basic income in India,"Universal basic income in India refers to the debate and practical experiments with universal basic income (UBI) in India. The greatest impetus has come from the 40-page chapter on UBI that the Economic Survey of India published in January 2017. It outlined the three themes of a proposed UBI programme: 

Universality - intent of providing every citizen ""a basic income to cover their needs""
Unconditionality - accessibility of all to basic income, without any means tests
Agency - citizen's independent ability to choose how they spend their income
The survey mentions that UBI ""liberates citizens from paternalistic and clientelistic relationships with the state"".
Several scholars, including Guy Standing and Pranab Bardhan, have expressed strong support of the implementation of UBI as an alternative to corrupt and ineffective existing social programmes in India. Organisations such as the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) and UNICEF have backed the proposal since launching the earlier 2010 UBI pilot programme in Madhya Pradesh, India.


== History ==
In 2016, the idea of a Universal Basic Income in India made huge news by taking up over forty pages in the 2016–2017 India Economic Survey as a serious and feasible solution to India's poverty and a hope for the economy as a whole. In India, this was an idea that has been discussed for decades in both the public and private spheres. Discussion of UBI in India began due to concerns about technologically driven unemployment and poor results of current welfare programmes. Given India's sheer size, implementation of UBI would have to be state-administered. Supporters believe this large-scale welfare programme could be revolutionary and could provide a poverty alleviation blueprint for other developing countries. However, critics are wary of establishing such a wide-scale programme because it might undermine the fragile social security architecture, cause already employed workers to drop out of labor force and encourage idleness, and also encourage wasteful spending. In the forward, the Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian writes, ""providing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) that has emerged as a raging new idea both in advanced economies and in India."" In the chapter itself, he notes: ""Universal Basic Income is a radical and compelling paradigm shift in thinking about both social justice and a productive economy. It could be to the twenty first century what civil and political rights were to the twentieth.""
From June 2011 to November 2012, Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) and the United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF), launched two pilot programmes to examine the impact of unconditional, monthly transfers through a modified and controlled trial. The pilot programme was notable in three main ways. First, it was universal, meaning that every individual test subject, irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or level of wealth, received a cash transfer. Second, these grants were provided beyond the existing welfare program, meaning it was not a substitute to payments which were already received. Third, these two pilot programmes were the latest of the eight UBI pilots which have been conducted around the world. Furthermore, these pilot programmes were one of the first in Asia and the second experiment to be conducted in the developing world.
During the global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and 2021 there has been several new articles in the Indian press. In June and July 2020 C. Rangarajan, former chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and S. Mahendra Dev, director and vice-chancellor, IGIDR, Mumbai, published an article arguing that India now must do two things, above all. The health care system must be improved, and there must be a robust system to provide minimum income support to all the poor, all the weak and vulnerable in society. For the purpose of minimising poverty they propose a basic income, but only to the women above 20, of Rs 4,000 annually. That would cost, according to their calculations, Rs 1.72 lakh crore or 0.84 per cent of GDP. Apart from that they also propose an expansion of the MGNREGA system in rural areas and to introduce an employment guarantee programme in urban areas.


=== Pilot programmes ===


==== Government experiments ====
Indian policymakers conducted two important studies testing the impact of unconditional cash transfers in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. The first study conducted from January to December 2011 in New Delhi tested the impact of cash transfers when offered in conjunction with existing public welfare. The Indian government in partnership with SEWA and the Madhya Pradesh state government, carried out a controlled trial. This experiment gave 100 randomly selected households 1,000 rupees per month. The money was deposited under the name of the female head of participating households in a bank. A more ambitious version of this study took place in Madhya Pradesh as a two pilot programme.


==== SEWA programme ====
In 2009, the Self Employed Women's Associations (SEWA) began organising pilot programmes to test the effect of an unconditional cash transfer in Madhya Pradesh, one of India's least developed states. SEWA is a trade union that was established in 1972 to promote the rights of self-employed, low income women throughout India. Its mission is to improve the standards of living for women in India and help women achieve full employment. The purpose of the Madhya Pradesh Unconditional Cash Transfers Project (MPUCTP) is to test the potential for cash transfers to address vulnerabilities that low income Indians face. The unconditional cash transfer is a form of a universal basic income, as it provides a set allowance to all civilians in a village every month without any restrictions on what the money can be used for.
The MPUCTP, backed by funding from UNICEF and implemented by SEWA, consisted of two pilot programmes in 2011 and 2012, both in Madhya Pradesh, a rural area in which SEWA tried to alleviate poverty and inequality. In the first pilot, which lasted 18 m, 20 similar villages were chosen. In eight villages, everyone received grants and in the remaining 12, no one did. In half of all the villages, regardless of whether a village received a grant or not, there were SEWA representatives present to monitor the village. These test villages had similar variables of socio-economic levels, service access, geographical location, and similar infrastructure. In the second pilot, which lasted 12 months, two similar tribal villages were chosen. Everyone in one village received grants and no one in the other village received anything. Between both pilots, over 6,000 individuals received cash transfers. In both pilots, every man, woman, and child in the selected villages were given a moderate unconditional cash grant: 200 per adult per month and 100 per child per month for 12 months. After 12 months, their grants were raised to 300 and 150, respectively, per month for 6 months. A child's grant was given to its mother or other designated guardian. These amounts accounted for 20 to 30 percent of a monthly income for a low income family.
To distribute money to families without bank accounts, SEWA used ""door-step"" banking. Some villagers were suspicious of SEWA giving ""free money"", fearing later conditions. SEWA could not directly address these issues and were dependent upon time and understanding.
On May 30 and 31 of 2013, SEWA presented its preliminary findings from the studies at a conference on ""Unconditional Cash Transfers: Findings from Two pilot studies"" in Delhi. The findings show numerous improvements in health, productivity, and financial stability. In terms of impacts to health, the unconditional cash transfers were associated with better food security and lower rates of malnutrition in female children. Less food deficiency improved children nutrition and led to more balanced diets. Recipient villages had lower rates of illness, more consistent medical treatment, and more consistent medicine intake. Families receiving cash transfers had more livestock, which helped improve health and financial stability. Additionally, productivity rates increased, as children in recipient villages had higher rates of school attendance. Villages receiving cash transfers had higher expenditures on schooling and agricultural inputs, promoting better education and higher agricultural yields. Some concerns of the universal basic income are that it will discourage labor and encourage consumption of alcohol. However, cash recipients had higher rates of labor and work, especially in self- employed contexts. And, there was no evidence of higher alcohol consumption in recipient villages than control villages; in fact, in the recipient tribal village, alcohol consumption actually decreased. The effect on labor productivity was especially strong for women and tribal communities. Financial stability improved significantly in villages receiving cash transfers. Households with cash grants were three times more likely to open a new business or take on a new production activity than households that did not receive the cash transfer. These households also decreased their indebtedness and increased their savings, and some were even able to open bank accounts to remit the cash grants.
One important factor not addressed in the study was the impact of environmental hazards on the sustainability of the project and, thus, the larger universal income idea. Although the positive results of the pilot programmes were overwhelming, the long-run impacts of such short term (12–18 months) projects cannot be measured. The results of the pilot programme disprove many criticisms of the programme, but further investigation and experimentation is necessary to test the feasibility of a universal basic income for India.


== Arguments for, against, and around basic income in India ==
Since 2016 there has been significant discussion and debate surrounding the idea of implementing a UBI in India. Through these talks, several politicians, economists, and leading national figures have raised the following arguments surrounding UBI and its potential effects for the country. Although UBI in India has been extensively discussed, specific policies surrounding the UBI in India is yet to be determined and enforced.


=== Arguments for ===


==== Emancipatory value ====
Guy Standing has argued, based on SEWA's 2010–2013 Madhya Pradesh basic income pilot, that the emancipatory value of basic income exceeds its monetary value where money itself is a scarce commodity. The emancipatory value is, according to Standing, greater because basic income has effects on the economic security of the receivers that goes beyond the increase in their income. He identifies four explanations for such effects: 1) While the basic income was used to reduce debt, it was also used to accumulate savings to be used in the case of sickness or other emergencies. In SEWA's basic income pilot the propensity to save was significantly higher among those who received the basic income. 2) The basic income reduced the level and severity of indebtedness beyond the monetary value of the basic income by giving household access to credit on better terms. For example, it decreased the dependency on expensive loans from an oligopolistic money lending class by enabling friends and relatives to offer loans to each other. Moreover, the basic income provided incentives for moneylenders to offer lower interest rates and aided households in avoiding taking on new loans. 3) On a community level, basic income may induce entrepreneurial efforts by reducing the consequences of failure. This may, in the long run, be beneficial for the economic security of a village as a whole. 4) Basic income increased the resilience to economic shocks by enabling collective responses to individual hazards. Furthermore, basic income functions as a secure source of revenue in times of economic insecurity.


==== UBI versus Indian public distribution system ====
Guy Standing argues that contrary to IPDS (Indian Public Distribution System), a basic income does not limit the choice of the recipient to a set of subsidised goods. Moreover, IPDS entails a higher cost associated with the distribution of goods which must be stored and transported by a branch of the government. This is particularly costly due to the decentralised nature of the ration shops currently characterising Indian rural life. Standing also points to certain costs related to shortcomings of the current scheme. For instance, the provision of subsidized grain is in some cases uncertain, potentially putting families under the burden of debt, and women must in some cases spend hours singling out good grains from bad. These are, according to Standing, costs that a basic income, with its more decentralised structure, may reduce or avoid.


==== Basic income to empower women ====
There are two qualifications that uniquely position India for the implementation of a universal basic income (UBI) - the lack of women in the public labor force and the presence of a large informal sector.
First, the UBI would help Indian women gain greater financial independence and thus enhance gender equality. In 2018, about 75% of adult Indian women are not employed in jobs outside of the home; without a source of income they are financially dependent on their husbands or families. If family relationships become strained, women often have no where else to go and are forced to remain in the difficult situation. Their lack of income constraints many women from making their own choices, even in situations of abuse and violence. A UBI would give these women some measure of autonomy.


==== Benefits for the informal work sector ====
Second, a UBI would uniquely benefit India because of its large informal sector. More than 90% of the Indian population works in the informal sector; the informal sector includes all businesses of less than 10 workers that are not taxed or monitored by government authorities. This segment of the workforce receives no benefits or pensions, and hence informal sector workers have no access to retirement savings, health benefits, or financial security. It is important to note that although this is especially prominent in rural India, even without accounting for the agricultural sectors of the economy, more than 80% of the Indian population is still employed in informal sector jobs. A UBI would enable this large part of the population to have some financial security in the case of unemployment, health issues, or any other extenuating circumstance.


==== Financial inclusion ====
Incorporating UBI through direct transfers would bring more people into the formal banking system. This also increases rural access to formal credit. This is a huge positive for farmers as they often gets trapped by informal credit indebtedness.


=== Arguments against ===
The biggest concern against the distribution of UBI is a worry for conspicuous spending, especially for males of the household on drugs, gambling or alcohol since most rural bank account holders are male. Another concern is a reduction of labour supply, since an insured income would lead people to work fewer hours. This theory, however, has been disproven in a study done by Banerjee, Hanna, Kreindler and Olken in 2015 who conducted a meta-analysis of government cash transfer programmes in Honduras, Morocco, Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia and Nicaragua and found that there was no significant drop in the workforce due to these programmes: ""They find no significant reduction in labour supply (inside and outside the household) for men or women from the provision of cash transfers."" Similar results derived from an experiment in few villages in Madhya Pradesh, India. Another argument Gender disparity (Since more males have financial access). Other arguments against UBI is the costs imposed on banks in carrying out UBI since it would require more workers and more hours required to implement the system. Lastly, there is also a claim that replacing things like food programmes with UBI would expose the population to more market risks. Price fluctuation will affect the purchasing power of the consumer.


=== Arguments around ===


==== Work unconditionality ====
A key concern is with the ""work unconditionality"" of the basic income proposal by which the income is paid no matter a person's employment status. Some believe money should not be given to those who do not contribute to society through their labor. Many fear that the unemployed would spend basic income money on items like alcohol, cigarettes and other addictive goods. Another related prevailing fear is that a universal basic income will deter people from working or seeking work altogether.


==== Universality ====
A very common concern regarding the UBI is whether or not it should be distributed to rich as well to the poor. Most advocates argue that it should be a universal and basic right for every citizen. Its function as a payment to everyone, rich and poor, is the very premise of its universality as opposed to just a basic income. Furthermore, many agree that the methods for determining who would and would not qualify are costly and time-consuming (open to corruption and system leaks) and risk leaving out too many needy individuals. They note that a UBI can be an effective safety net for anyone who encounters a crisis, including those who are middle class. However, there might be resistance to the wealthy gaining benefit of UBI.
Another reason for making the basic income universal is more logistical. In order to segment the population and ensure that the correct people are receiving the benefits without corruption a large amount of administrative labor is required, in addition to infrastructure and technology in place to support it. To this extent, universalising is important because the potential for misallocation and corruption with targeting is considered too great by many. In this manner, there would be no administrative labor required to define and operate the poor from the non-poor. In this way, the result of universalising is beneficial for the state and its people.
The question to consider is how can we fairly determine this data and ensure equal distribution while not putting too much strain on the administration. There have been issues in the past with allocation of well fare programmes such as targeting and misallocation. It is tough to try and target only the poor and deserving. Whether it was self-reporting or more multidimensional – identification criteria, or government audits, there has been criticism from many sides and reports of corruption. As for misallocation, many deserving households are excluded from welfare schemes due to misallocation.  ""For instance, consider the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh: despite accounting for over half the poor in the country, these states access only a third of the resources spent on the MGNREGS in 2015–2016"" MGNREGS is a welfare scheme. However, this issue is easier to resolve if UBI is implemented through direct deposits rather than through state allocation of funding.


==== Alternatives ====
Other options are being considered and proposed. One idea is to target certain populations instead of giving an income to the entire population. This idea is resisted by others for whom the universality is a fundamental and inviolable principle of the basic income. In order to reduce GDP expenditure on UBI, alternative proposals have been made. Other options for a more targeted programme have been aired: The first is an ""opt out"" system in which the wealthiest 25% of India are given the option of withdrawing. The names of those in the top 25% who choose to remain in the programme would be published, as a shaming device. Another option is to target specifically marginalised and vulnerable groups such as the disabled or widowed. Another option is providing UBI as a choice to beneficiaries of other programmes. People who receive other benefits would have the choice between opting in for UBI instead. There have also been considerations of UBI for Women as women are worse of in employment opportunities, education and financial inclusion. Finally, there is an option of starting UBI for urban areas because they have bank accounts, have access to banks vs rural populations, the infrastructure is tricky and they mostly have allocations through state.


== Funding strategies ==
Something to consider is whether the universal basic income in India is financially feasible. Research indicates that in order to implement the UBI, existing welfare programmes would have to be terminated to free up resources. This raises questions, especially about the Indian government's large programmes such as the Food Subsidy or Public Distribution System (PDS) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) which would have to be stopped for the UBI to be implemented. Current social welfare schemes cost India about 3.7% of GDP, but UBI is expected to cost 4.9% of GDP. The question of where this extra funding will come from remains.


== Prominent advocates ==

Guy Standing, is a professor of Development Studies and co-author of Basic Income: A Transformative Policy for India, who claims basic income is a ""matter of social justice."" Among Standing's co-authors are other advocates such as Sarath Davala, an independent sociologist, who, in his 2017 Tedx Talk, expressed support for unconditional basic income due its emancipatory effects. Renana Jhabvala, the founder of the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA) who facilitated the basic income pilot programme, advocates for basic income as ""a social policy whose time has come."" Pranab Bardhan, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, explains that ""basic income may very well be fiscally feasible – not to mention socially desirable – in places where the poverty threshold is low and existing social safety nets are both threadbare and expensive to administer."" Indian politician Baijayant Panda has also advocated for basic income in India, explaining that ""India may be actually be a better case for a basic income"" compared to other nations. In 2019, the leading opposition party Indian National Congress announced the NYAY scheme in its election manifesto which was modelled on Universal Basic Income. Vikas Singh, an Indian economist and advocate of basic income, spoke in his TedX talk about equality being the bedrock of democracy.

Flame deflector,"A flame deflector, flame diverter or flame trench is a structure or device designed to redirect or disperse the flame, heat, and exhaust gases produced by rocket engines or other propulsion systems. The amount of thrust generated by a rocket launch, along with the sound it produces during liftoff, can damage the launchpad and service structure, as well as the launch vehicle. The primary goal of the diverter is to prevent the flame from causing damage to equipment, infrastructure, or the surrounding environment. Flame diverters can be found at rocket launch sites and test stands where large volumes of exhaust gases are expelled during engine testing or vehicle launch.


== Design and operation ==
The diverter typically comprises a robust, heat-resistant structure that channels the force of the exhaust gases and flames in a specific direction, typically away from the rocket or equipment. This is essential to prevent the potentially destructive effects of the high-temperature gases and to reduce the acoustic impact of the ignition.
A flame trench can also be used in combination with a diverter to form a trench-deflector system. The flames from the rocket travel through openings in the launchpad onto a flame deflector situated in the flame trench, which runs underneath the launch structure and extends well beyond the launchpad itself. To further reduce the acoustic effects a water sound suppression system may be also used.


== Notable examples ==


=== Apollo program ===
During the Apollo program the need for a flame deflector was a determining factor in the design of the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39. NASA designers chose a two-way, wedge-type metal flame deflector. It measured 13 meters in height and 15 meters in width, with a total weight of 317 tons. Since the water table was close to the surface of the ground, the designers wanted the bottom of the flame trench at ground level. The flame deflector and trench determined the height and width of the octagonal shaped launch pad.


=== Space Shuttle program ===

During the Space Shuttle program NASA modified Launch Complex 39B at Kennedy Space Center. They installed a flame trench that was 150 meters long, 18 meters wide, and 13 meters deep. It was built with concrete and refractory brick. The main flame deflector was situated inside the trench directly underneath the rocket boosters. The V-shaped steel structure was covered with a high-temperature concrete material. It separated the exhaust of the orbiter main engines and of the solid rocket boosters into two flame trenches. It was approximately 11.6 meters high, 17.5 meters wide, and 22 meters long. The Shuttle flame trench-diverter system was refurbished for the SLS program.


=== Baikonur Cosmodrome ===

The main launch pads at the Russian launch complex of Baikonur Cosmodrome use a flame pit to manage launch exhaust. The launch vehicles are transported by rail to the launch pad, where they are vertically erected over a large flame deflector pit. A similar structure was built by the European Space Agency at its Guiana Space Centre.


=== SpaceX Starship launch mount ===
During the first orbital test flight of SpaceX's Starship vehicle in April 2023, the launch mount of Starbase was substantially damaged due to the lack of a flame diverter system. The 33 Raptor rocket engines dug a 25-foot-deep (7.6 m) crater and scattered debris and dust over a wide area. The company designed a new water deluge based flame diverter that protects the launch mount and vehicle by spraying large quantities of water from a piece of steel equipment under the rocket. In November of the same year, the new water deluge system successfully protected the launchpad during the second orbital flight test of Starship, avoiding the cloud of dust and debris that rose up during the first test.

Blender (software),"Blender is a free, open source 3D computer graphics program. It is available for many operating systems, for example Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. It is made by the Blender Foundation. It was used, for example, to make the short movies Elephants Dream, Big Buck Bunny and Sintel.


== History ==
A Dutch animation studio called NeoGeo created Blender as an in-house application. The song Yello, which is from a song album called Baby, started an idea of the name ""Blender"". Ton Roosendaal founded NaN in June 1998. He wanted to make and show off the program to the public. The program was published as shareware until NaN went bankrupt in 2002. The creditors, people who have other people oweing money to them, agreed to sell out Blender under the laws of the GNU General Public License in exchange for a one-time payment of 100,000 Euros (102,000 in U.S. dollars.) On July 18, 2002, Roosendaal put money into a Blender funding campaign—in order to collect donations. On September 7, 2002, the collected funds was given notice to the public. This proved that the Blender source code would be published. Blender is now an open source program. Right now, the Blender Foundation watches and takes care of it. It is the Blender Foundation's responsibility to do such a thing. The Blender Foundation have the right to use dual licensing, so that, in addition to GNU GPL, Blender would also have the permission to use the following name: ""Blender License"". Blender License does not have a rule that says it needs a disclosing source code but it does have a rule on payments to the Blender Foundation. On the other hand, this choice was never used and became null in 2005. Right now, Blender belongs only to GNU GPL.


== Features ==
Blender has many features and tools, such as:

Modelling tools for creating 3D models, materials etc.
Rendering engine (part of the program that draws the image of the 3D scene).
Physics engine which can be used to make simulations of collisions, water, smoke etc.
Animation tools which can be used to make 3D models move, e.g. for movies.
Video editor.
Grease pencil tool for 2D drawings

Stick figure,"A stick figure, also known as a stick man, is a very simple drawing of a 
person or an animal, composed of a few lines, curves, and dots.   It is often drawn by children, and known for its simplistic style. On a stick figure, the head is most often represented by a circle, which can be either a solid color or sometimes embellished with details such as eyes, a mouth, or hair. The arms, legs, torso, and abdomen are usually represented with these straight lines. Details such as hands, feet, and a neck may be present or absent; simpler stick figures often display an ambiguous emotional expression or disproportionate limbs, however, most stick figures can be drawn with four or three fingers.
The stick figure is a universally recognizable symbol, in all likelihood one of the most well known in the world. It transcends language, location, demographics, and can trace back its roots for almost 30,000 years. Its simplicity and versatility led to the stick figure being used for a variety of purposes: info graphics, signage, comics, animations, games, film storyboards, and many kinds of visual media all employ the stick figure. With the advent of the World Wide Web, the stick figure became a central element within an entire genre of web-based interactive entertainment known as flash animation. Over a period of more than two decades, stick figure animation impacted and shaped the visual landscape of the internet.


== Animations ==
Stick figures have also become popular to make simple, and often violent, animations. YouTube channels such as Alan Becker and Hyun's Dojo community create small series of videos.

Daxi Wood Art Ecomuseum,"The Daxi Wood Art Ecomuseum (traditional Chinese: 大溪木藝生態博物館; simplified Chinese: 大溪木艺生态博物馆; pinyin: Dàxī Mùyì Shēngtài Bówùguǎn) is a museum complex in Daxi District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan. The idea of ecomuseum is based on Scandinavian concept which emphasizes the integration between local communities and the preservation of cultural assets. 


== History ==
The establishment of this museum started with the renovation of building in the area and incorporated them with the local old streets which was initiated in 1996. The first museum building opened to the public is the Number One Hall, a Japanese-style house constructed in the 1920s. It was also the residence for the principle of Daxi Elementary School. The previous owner of the house, Mr.  Mao-Lin Chen and his wife Mrs. Cui-Wu Chen-Wang used to teach tailoring classes at the house. The banner hung high up above the front door that reads ""Xiguang Tailoring Class"" brings back many memories for the women of Daxi. Converted from a private residence to a public space, this old house has been imbued with new life.
In 2014, the museum building underwent renovation. In 2015, the renovation of the first hall and Wude Temple were completed and the two buildings were reopened. In 2016, the Craftsman Story House and the Crafts Exchange Hall were also reopened.


== Architecture ==
The museum complex is divided into the Daxi Wood Art Industry and Daxi Resident Lifestyle. Public buildings include martial arts training center Butokuden and a cluster of 22 Japanese style buildings. The buildings are renovated in different stages according to their age, which will also incorporate the local historical streets and houses to convert Daxi to a cultural museum.
Notable buildings are:

Daxi Butokuden (Chinese: 武德殿; pinyin: Dà Xī Wǔ Dé Diàn)
Lee Teng-fan's Ancient Residence (Chinese: 李騰芳古宅; pinyin: Lǐténgfāng Gǔ Zhái)

Chromosphere,"A chromosphere (""sphere of color"") is the second layer of a star's atmosphere. It is located above the photosphere and below the solar transition region and corona. The term usually refers to the Sun's chromosphere, but not only.

In the Sun's atmosphere, the chromosphere is about 3,000 to 5,000 kilometers (1,900 to 3,100 miles) in height, or a little more than 1% of the Sun's radius at maximum thickness. It possesses a homogeneous layer at the border with the photosphere. Hair-like jets of plasma, called spicules, rise from this homogeneous area and through the chromosphere, extending up to 10,000 km (6,200 mi) into the corona above.
The chromosphere has a usual and expected red color due to electromagnetic emissions in the Hα spectral line. Information about the chromosphere is mostly received by analysis of its given-off electromagnetic radiation. 
Chromospheres have also been followed on stars other than the Sun. On large stars, chromospheres sometimes make up a significant proportion of the whole star. For example, the chromosphere of supergiant star Antares has been found to be about 2.5 times larger in thickness than the star's radius.

Outline of software,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to software:
Software – collection of computer programs and related data that provides the information for the functioning of a computer. It is held in various forms of memory of the computer. It comprises procedures, algorithms, and documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system. The term was coined to contrast to the term hardware, meaning physical devices. In contrast to hardware, software ""cannot be touched"". Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning application software only. Sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film, tapes, and records.

Xylotechnigraphy,"Xylotechnigraphy is an architectural term for a decorative treatment to wood. By staining, finishing, and graining, the wood resembles a more expensive or finer type. The process was invented by A. F. Brophy and patented in England in 1871.
In a paper read before a meeting of the Royal Institute of British Architects three years after xylotechnigraphy was patented, G. T. Robinson described it as ""in principle exceedingly simple. ... To ceilings, doors, dados in our private houses, to partitions and fittings of our banks and commercial offices, this process is, I conceive, exceedingly applicable, and to our larger and less movable pieces of furniture it is not misapplied, though I confess to a lurking dislike to it in those lesser articles to which true inlay, by reason of their smaller process, seems more aesthetically appropriate.""
In the same paper, Robinson quoted the patent in which Brophy detailed the process:

In order to stain wood in various colours, according to any suitable design, leaving, if desired, parts of the wood unstained, so as to obtain an imitation of inlay, I proceed as follows: I first apply a varnish or solution which will fill the pores of the wood, and exclude the staining liquid from such parts of the surface as are to remain unstained, then when the varnish or solution is dry, I apply over the whole surface the lightest stain I intend to use; this stain being dry I again apply the varnish, or stopping, coating with it such parts of the surface as I desire to retain of a colour corresponding to the lightest stain, and so I proceed until the desired effect is obtained, the last stain applied being usually black or a very dark stain. The surface having been cleared off may, if desired, be varnished or polished all over, or it may remain as it is left by the last staining process.

Proprietary software,"Proprietary software (or closed source software) does not let people see or change source code of the computer software. It is the opposite of free software. Proprietary software is usually created by businesses who want to sell their software, but some programs that are free to use are still proprietary because the user is not allowed to change them. With proprietary software, only the people that make the software can see and change the code.
Even if the people who make the program give the source code to other people, the program will be proprietary if they do not allow to do important things like these: 

Change the code;
Give the code to other people;
Give the changed code to other people;
Use the code on a different computer;
Most companies who sell their software for money (and even some who do not charge money for it) make it proprietary source. This makes it harder for people to copy and change the software, or to use the source code to make similar software. It helps prevent a user from pretending to be the author of someone else's work (a way of plagiarism).

Planetary coordinate system,"A planetary coordinate system (also referred to as planetographic, planetodetic, or planetocentric) is a generalization of the geographic, geodetic, and the geocentric coordinate systems for planets other than Earth.
Similar coordinate systems are defined for other solid celestial bodies, such as in the selenographic coordinates for the Moon.
The coordinate systems for almost all of the solid bodies in the Solar System were established by Merton E. Davies of the Rand Corporation, including Mercury, Venus, Mars, the four Galilean moons of Jupiter, and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune.
A planetary datum is a generalization of geodetic datums for other planetary bodies, such as the Mars datum; it requires the specification of physical reference points or surfaces with fixed coordinates, such as a specific crater for the reference meridian or the best-fitting equigeopotential as zero-level surface.


== Longitude ==

The longitude systems of most of those bodies with observable rigid surfaces have been defined by references to a surface feature such as a crater. The north pole is that pole of rotation that lies on the north side of the invariable plane of the Solar System (near the ecliptic). The location of the prime meridian as well as the position of the body's north pole on the celestial sphere may vary with time due to precession of the axis of rotation of the planet (or satellite). If the position angle of the body's prime meridian increases with time, the body has a direct (or prograde) rotation; otherwise the rotation is said to be retrograde.
In the absence of other information, the axis of rotation is assumed to be normal to the mean orbital plane; Mercury and most of the satellites are in this category. For many of the satellites, it is assumed that the rotation rate is equal to the mean orbital period. In the case of the giant planets, since their surface features are constantly changing and moving at various rates, the rotation of their magnetic fields is used as a reference instead. In the case of the Sun, even this criterion fails (because its magnetosphere is very complex and does not really rotate in a steady fashion), and an agreed-upon value for the rotation of its equator is used instead.
For planetographic longitude, west longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the west) are used when the rotation is prograde, and east longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the east) when the rotation is retrograde. In simpler terms, imagine a distant, non-orbiting observer viewing a planet as it rotates. Also suppose that this observer is within the plane of the planet's equator. A point on the Equator that passes directly in front of this observer later in time has a higher planetographic longitude than a point that did so earlier in time.
However, planetocentric longitude is always measured positively to the east, regardless of which way the planet rotates. East is defined as the counter-clockwise direction around the planet, as seen from above its north pole, and the north pole is whichever pole more closely aligns with the Earth's north pole. Longitudes traditionally have been written using ""E"" or ""W"" instead of ""+"" or ""−"" to indicate this polarity. For example, −91°, 91°W, +269° and 269°E all mean the same thing.
The modern standard for maps of Mars (since about 2002) is to use planetocentric coordinates. Guided by the works of historical astronomers, Merton E. Davies established the meridian of Mars at Airy-0 crater. For Mercury, the only other planet with a solid surface visible from Earth, a thermocentric coordinate is used: the prime meridian runs through the point on the equator where the planet is hottest (due to the planet's rotation and orbit, the Sun briefly retrogrades at noon at this point during perihelion, giving it more sunlight). By convention, this meridian is defined as exactly twenty degrees of longitude east of Hun Kal.
Tidally-locked bodies have a natural reference longitude passing through the point nearest to their parent body: 0° the center of the primary-facing hemisphere, 90° the center of the leading hemisphere, 180° the center of the anti-primary hemisphere, and 270° the center of the trailing hemisphere. However, libration due to non-circular orbits or axial tilts causes this point to move around any fixed point on the celestial body like an analemma.


== Latitude ==

Planetographic latitude and planetocentric latitude may be similarly defined.
The zero latitude plane (Equator) can be defined as orthogonal to the mean axis of rotation (poles of astronomical bodies).
The reference surfaces for some planets (such as Earth and Mars) are ellipsoids of revolution for which the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius, such that they are oblate spheroids.


== Altitude ==
Vertical position can be expressed with respect to a given vertical datum, by means of physical quantities analogous to the topographical geocentric distance (compared to a constant nominal Earth radius or the varying geocentric radius of the reference ellipsoid surface) or altitude/elevation (above and below the geoid).
The areoid (the geoid of Mars) has been measured using flight paths of satellite missions such as Mariner 9 and Viking. The main departures from the ellipsoid expected of an ideal fluid are from the Tharsis volcanic plateau, a continent-size region of elevated terrain, and its antipodes.
The selenoid (the geoid of the Moon) has been measured gravimetrically by the GRAIL twin satellites.


== Ellipsoid of revolution (spheroid) ==
Reference ellipsoids are also useful for defining geodetic coordinates and mapping other planetary bodies including planets, their satellites, asteroids and comet nuclei. Some well observed bodies such as the Moon and Mars now have quite precise reference ellipsoids.
For rigid-surface nearly-spherical bodies, which includes all the rocky planets and many moons, ellipsoids are defined in terms of the axis of rotation and the mean surface height excluding any atmosphere. Mars is actually egg shaped, where its north and south polar radii differ by approximately 6 km (4 miles), however this difference is small enough that the average polar radius is used to define its ellipsoid. The Earth's Moon is effectively spherical, having almost no bulge at its equator. Where possible, a fixed observable surface feature is used when defining a reference meridian.
For gaseous planets like Jupiter, an effective surface for an ellipsoid is chosen as the equal-pressure boundary of one bar. Since they have no permanent observable features, the choices of prime meridians are made according to mathematical rules.


=== Flattening ===

For the WGS84 ellipsoid to model Earth, the defining values are 

a (equatorial radius): 6 378 137.0 m

 (inverse flattening): 298.257 223 563
from which one derives

b (polar radius): 6 356 752.3142 m,
so that the difference of the major and minor semi-axes is 21.385 km (13 mi). This is only 0.335% of the major axis, so a representation of Earth on a computer screen would be sized as 300 pixels by 299 pixels. This is rather indistinguishable from a sphere shown as 300 pix by 300 pix. Thus illustrations typically greatly exaggerate the flattening to highlight the concept of any planet's oblateness.
Other f values in the Solar System are 1⁄16 for Jupiter, 1⁄10 for Saturn, and 1⁄900 for the Moon. The flattening of the Sun is about 9×10−6.


==== Origin of flattening ====
In 1687, Isaac Newton published the Principia in which he included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid of revolution (a spheroid). The amount of flattening depends on the density and  the balance of gravitational force and centrifugal force.


=== Equatorial bulge ===

Generally any celestial body that is rotating (and that is sufficiently massive to draw itself into spherical or near spherical shape) will have an equatorial bulge matching its rotation rate. With 11808 km Saturn is the planet with the largest equatorial bulge in our Solar System.


==== Equatorial ridges ====
Equatorial bulges should not be confused with equatorial ridges. Equatorial ridges are a feature of at least four of Saturn's moons: the large moon Iapetus and the tiny moons Atlas, Pan, and Daphnis. These ridges closely follow the moons' equators. The ridges appear to be unique to the Saturnian system, but it is uncertain whether the occurrences are related or a coincidence. The first three were discovered by the Cassini probe in 2005; the Daphnean ridge was discovered in 2017. The ridge on Iapetus is nearly 20 km wide, 13 km high and 1300 km long. The ridge on Atlas is proportionally even more remarkable given the moon's much smaller size, giving it a disk-like shape. Images of Pan show a structure similar to that of Atlas, while the one on Daphnis is less pronounced.


== Triaxial ellipsoid ==

Small moons, asteroids, and comet nuclei frequently have irregular shapes. For some of these, such as Jupiter's Io, a scalene (triaxial) ellipsoid is a better fit than the oblate spheroid. For highly irregular bodies, the concept of a reference ellipsoid may have no useful value, so sometimes a spherical reference is used instead and points identified by planetocentric latitude and longitude. Even that can be problematic for non-convex bodies, such as Eros, in that latitude and longitude don't always uniquely identify a single surface location.
Smaller bodies (Io, Mimas, etc.) tend to be better approximated by triaxial ellipsoids; however, triaxial ellipsoids would render many computations more complicated, especially those related to map projections. Many projections would lose their elegant and popular properties. For this reason spherical reference surfaces are frequently used in mapping programs.

Booting,"Booting is what happens when a computer starts. This happens when the power is turned on. It is called ""reboot"" if it happens at other times. When you boot a computer, your processor looks for instructions in system ROM (the BIOS) and executes them. They normally 'wake up' peripheral equipment and search for the boot device. The boot device either loads the operating system or gets it from somewere else.
People use the word ""boot"" to mean ""to start a computer"" or other device with electronics built in. For example, if a person wants to ask a friend to turn on a satellite phone, they would say ""could you boot up the satellite phone?"".
Most operating systems call the first data storage device it uses a boot device.  It may also be called a bootstrap loader. This is because the computer is making itself go, as in the idiom.  When we start a computer, we can often see the simple instructions the computer uses to start, then more complicated pictures or software. 
The phrase ""to boot"" in this meaning is short for ""to bootstrap"".  This use is part of net jargon along with similar multi-use words like Internet or web.  Often the computer is just called a box, so a phrase like ""to boot the box"" means ""to start the computer"".
The term ""reboot"" can also be used in a different context to mean a restarting of a storyline established in previous iterations of a series of fiction.",0
Medical diagnosis,"A medical diagnosis (an. Greek δια-γνωστικος — able to recognize) is when a doctor finds out what is making someone sick. Sometimes doctors can diagnose a sickness by asking the person questions and looking at the person's body. Sometimes doctors do tests. Tests can mean taking a small bit of blood, urine, or tissue which is sent to a hospital laboratory where it is tested. X-rays are another form of test. Tests are ways to see how the body is working.
When a diagnosis has been made, the doctor may recommend treatment.


== Process ==
The process of diagnosis begins from the very beginning of the patient's examination in a medical institution or during a call to the doctor at the patient's place of residence. Diagnosis of the disease begins with the collection of medical history. After collecting the anamnesis, the doctor examines the patient, during which he performs percussion and auscultation of the patient, palpation of the disease, measures the patient's blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate, and measures the patient's body temperature.
Laboratory examination methods include general clinical tests, which include a general blood test, a general urine test, and a stool test. Laboratory methods of examination also include biochemical methods of examination, during which the level of glucose, creatinine, urea, bilirubin, liver enzymes, blood lipids is determined; coagulogram, which analyzes the indicators of blood clotting; blood hormone tests; determination of tumor markers; tests of blood and other biological materials for infectious diseases; allergological, toxicological, cytological and parasitological examinations.
Instrumental methods of examination include X-ray, endoscopic, ultrasound, methods of recording the electrical activity of organs (including ECG and EEG) and a number of other methods of examination.
To diagnose disorders of some systems and organs, methods of recording the electrical activity of organs are used, which include, in particular, ECG and EEG.

Traditional animation,"Traditional animation is much harder than today's style of animation. It often uses a stop-motion camera to ""liven"", or animate, the photos made by the producer. When movie-makers use stop-motion, they need to draw one picture for every scene. However, there are tools to help save time with movie-making. Other types of animation, such as limited or digital animation, can also be used now. FPS is the number of times a movie is shot in one second.


== Process ==


=== Filming ===
The photographer first shoots out or edits many photos. These photos are combined to make the storyline. And as with all movies, not all scenes make it into the final movie.


=== Editing ===
Many people help out in the editing of a movie. But in old times, people had to draw the scenes on their own. Then the stop-motion camera took a photo of a scene once a second.


== Involvement ==
Most movies or cartoons in the 1950's required very hard work of the editors. To make things cheaper, though, people made limited animation that used two to three copies of the same image (so the stop-motion process would be two to three times faster.)


== Current ==
Right now movie-makers use digital animation to ""liven the movie even more"". Movies from the 2000 to 2010 years are usually 1–2 hours long.


== Common units ==


=== FPS ===
FPS, or frames per second, is the number of scenes being shot in one second. The higher this is, the more ""smooth"" the film looks. Most movies have an FPS of 24 to 60.


== Tools ==


=== Cels ===
Cels, or celluloids, are tools used to ""preserve"" scenes. An editor uses a cell to draw a scene then make changes to it on the next drawing. It is useful when a cartoon or movie involves moving figures or objects.


=== Sketcher ===
Sometimes a sketch pad is used to draft the scenes the editors think would be good in the movie. A sketchpad at first may contain a comic book that looks like an animation when the editors flip it back and forth.


=== Live video shower ===
Often editors preview the animation with a video shower. On the stream of scenes, movie-makers test their animation and fix bugs or problems.

Arecibo message,"The Arecibo message was a short radio message sent into space to celebrate the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974. It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth. M13 was chosen because it was the right size, and was in the sky at the right time and place for the ceremony. 
Dr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from Carl Sagan, among others. The message was in seven parts which show:

The numbers one (1) to ten (10)
The atomic numbers of the elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, which make up deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
The formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA
The number of nucleotides in DNA, and a graphic of the double helix structure of DNA
A figure of a human, the size of an average man, and the human population of Earth
The Solar System
The Arecibo Observatory and the diameter of the transmitting antenna dish
It will take 25,000 years for the message to reach the stars, and at least another 25,000 years to get any reply. This means the Arecibo message was a show of human technological achievement, not a real attempt to talk to extraterrestrial life.  The stars of M13 that the message was aimed at will no longer be in that location when the message arrives. Cornell University said on November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact, but to show the power of the new equipment. (Cornell University had built and operated the radio telescope for the United States National Science Foundation.)
The message consisted of 1679 binary digits, about 210 bytes. It was transmitted at a frequency of 2380 MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10 Hz, with a power of 1000 kW. The ""ones"" and ""zeros"" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.
The cardinality of 1679 was chosen because it is a semiprime. It can be arranged as a rectangle of 73 rows by 23 columns. The other arrangement, 23 rows by 73 columns, does not produce a meaningful result. The message forms the image shown on the right, or its inverse, when translated into graphics characters and spaces.
In 2009 the band Boxcutter made an album called the Arecibo Message, which has a lot of short songs.

Xylotheque,"A xylotheque or xylothek (from the Greek xylon for ""wood"" and theque meaning ""repository"") is special form of herbarium that consists of a collection of authenticated wood specimens. It is also known as a xylarium (from the Greek xylon for ""wood"" and Latin arium meaning ""separate place""). Traditionally, xylotheque specimens were in the form of book-shaped volumes, each made of a particular kind of wood and holding samples of the different parts of the corresponding plant. While the terms are often used interchangeably, some use xylotheque to refer to these older collections of wooden 'books' and xylarium for modern collections in which some or all of the specimens are in simpler shapes, such as blocks or plaques with information engraved on their surfaces. Many countries have at least one xylotheque with native flora, and some also house flora from other parts of the world. They are valuable to specialists in forestry, botany, conservation, forensics, art restoration, paleontology, archaeology, and other fields.


== History ==
Xylotheques date back to the later 17th century, when wood specimens began to appear in cabinets of curiosity. Over time, they grew larger and more systematic, with hundreds of individual volumes in a single collection. The oldest extant collection was established in 1823 at the University of Leningrad, and by the middle of the century they had been established in many European countries. Australia now houses 12 xylaria holding 11% of the world's wood specimens, while the Oxford Forestry Institute's xylarium holds about 13%.
In older xylotheques, the wooden volumes were typically made out of the same wood as the specimens inside and sometimes decorated with tree bark and associated lichens and mosses. Each volume housed seeds, flowers, twigs, and leaves from the corresponding tree or bush, along with a written description hidden in a small compartment set into the inner spine. An alternative form of xylotheque found in Japan and elsewhere featured paintings of the plant parts rather than actual field specimens.  
Even a modest collection of wood samples has value, as each of its samples has a particular history. Xylotheques provide comparison samples for xylotomy, art historical studies, and scientific studies of the physical and mechanical properties of wood, such as durability and preservation. Xylotheques are also useful for anyone who needs to make a morphological-visual analysis of wood.
The xylotheque with the largest number of samples is the Samuel James Record Collection in the United States, which holds 98,000 samples. Formerly housed at the Forestry School of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, it was transferred to the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory in 1969. The second largest xylotheque belongs to the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium, with 57,000 samples. The Thünen Institute of Wood Research in Hamburg has more than 37,000 samples.


== Selected xylotheques ==


== Index xylariorum ==
The Index xylariorum is a listing of the world's xylaria. It was conceived of by William Louis Stern (1926– ) who first published the work in 1967. A subsequent work in 1981 was published by the Botanic Garden of the Polish Academy of Sciences as ""No. 1"" of the series. Stern then published the third revised edition of this work in 1988. Anna H. Lynch and Peter E. Gasson compiled Index Xylariorum 4.1 in 2010, and the International Association of Wood Anatomists updated the list in 2016 under the supervision of Frederic Lens. In addition to the link to the PDF of this document provided in the reference list of this article, Index Xylariorum 4.1 can also be accessed online as a database through the Global Timber Tracking Network website here.
Below is a list of the Index xylariorum codes, locations, and institutional names included by Stern in his 1988 Index xylariorum. This list is provided for historic context.


== In popular culture ==
For documenta 13 in 2012, American artist Mark Dion created a new hexagonal display chamber for the Schildbach Xylotheque at the Natural History Museum in Kassel, Germany. As part of the project, he created six new volumes made of wood from each of the continents (excluding Antarctica).

International Cities of Peace,"International Cities of Peace (ICP) is a global association of cities of peace dedicated to developing and implementing programs that foster a community culture of peace.
International Cities of Peace is the main program of Cities of Peace, Inc., a nonprofit non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the United States. In 2017, the association achieved Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations.
Established in 2009, the association of International Cities of Peace has members in over 400 communities in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South and Central America, and Oceania. Each member of the International Cities of Peace network is self-organized either by government proclamation, resolution, or a community leadership team.
Whether established by community government proclamation or resolution, or by an inter-community initiative, each city of peace is a signatory of a letter of intent that includes the United Nations Culture of Peace Resolution, which addresses a Culture of Peace, as defined by that Resolution. The association of International Cities of Peace defines peace as safety, prosperity and quality of life. 


== History ==
International City of Peace originated in 2009 when J. Frederick Arment envisioned a global network of cities of peace. A city of peace is an ancient archetype that captures a universal ideal of a community of and at peace. The first city to be recognized as an International City of Peace was Dayton, Ohio in 2010, in a proclamation written by J. Frederick Arment and signed by then-Mayor Gary Leitzell. The network has since expanded to include over 400 civic municipalities worldwide. Each City of Peace agrees to be a signatory to the tenets of the U.N. Culture of Peace Resolution.


===== Founding and early years =====
The founding principles of the International Cities of Peace were established to create a global network dedicated to peace. The early goals included promoting peacebuilding initiatives and encouraging cities to adopt proactive steps in fostering harmony.
Significant events include the first City of Peace Summit, held at the Dayton International Peace Museum in 2006. The accompanying map shows annual growth.


===== The City of Peace concept =====
According to the only scholarly paper to date on Cities of Peace, ""Idee und Geschichte der neuzeitlichen Friedensstadt"", written by scholar Peter Vanden Dungen, the following are major categories for consideration as Cities of Peace. Though many Cities of Peace are now being established by resolution, proclamation, or a community action campaign, this listing shows that the City of Peace ideal has deep roots. Published only in German, the following is a rough translation of Vanden Dungen's typology.

Cities where a particular war has been successfully concluded (through a peace treaty).
Cities which are the seats of international institutions which are significant for the maintenance of world peace.
Cities where important peace prizes are awarded/places where peace is being celebrated and honored.
Cities that, having been destroyed in war, have used this tragedy to dedicate themselves to work for peace.
Cities that have been rediscovered and now are reconnecting with historical impulses from the past, especially the remembrance of a prominent historical figure born in (or associated with) the city, and who was a great peace advocate.
Cities where important peace institutions once existed, or which once hosted important peace conferences.
Cities where important peace research or peace training institutions have been created.
Cities that have joined one or more important international peace organizations, and which are playing a significant role in them.
Cities of practical peacemaking, in ethnically diverse and polarized environments.
Cities that have given their name to important peace documents.


== Organizational structure ==
The International City of Peace is governed by a board of directors of Cities of Peace, Inc., and is supported by a global network of facilitators, volunteers, and an advisory council. The organization operates regionally through continental coordinators.


===== Leadership Council =====
The Leadership Council of International Cities of Peace consists of over 400 liaisons in over 75 countries on all six continents. They provide community leadership and communications between their communities and the association of International Cities of Peace. Each liaison leads a team dedicated to establishing goals and objectives for fostering community peace.


===== Peacebuilding projects =====
City-to-City Program: Collaborative projects involve multiple cities working together on peacebuilding efforts, which are detailed in over 400 City of Peace profiles on the organization's member listings.
Notable projects include the Aalborg, Denmark's work in the Nakivale refugee settlement in Uganda, which successfully engaged over ten Cities of peace in a vision of the first refugee city of Peace project.
In Nanjing, China, which established an International City of Peace in 2017, major initiatives in peace studies, developed by the UNESCO Chair of Peace Studies in China, have expanded peace literacy and peace studies programs in four other megacities in China.


== Recognition ==
Members of International Cities of Peace are awarded this status based on their dedication to peace and their efforts and vision for fostering a culture of peace.
Examples of recognized cities include Derry-Londonderry, Northern Ireland, known for its progress in moving from violence to peace, and Buenos Aires, Argentina where the Milenios de Paz network has engaged over 40 Cities of Peace in communities throughout South America.


===== Impact and global reach =====
International City of Peace has made a significant impact on the global peace movement, with a growing number of cities joining the network.

The network includes over 400 communities across six continents, reflecting the organization's broad influence and global reach.
Examples of successful outcomes include Dayton, Ohio, where peace initiatives have led to increased community cohesion; Nanjing, China, where the association has helped in expanding peace studies programs in China; and Lagos, Nigeria, where a mediation program has been implemented to reduce conflict in Nigeria and other African countries.


== Challenges and criticism ==
When the organization was founded, the main question from the public was, ""What do you mean by peace?"" The association defined peace as the Consensus Values of Peace: Safety, Prosperity, and Quality of Life  for all in the community.
The association of International Cities of Peace, and its parent organization, Cities of Peace, inc., faces challenges presented by global sanctions policies. The association receives membership applications from municipalities in countries under sanctions by the United States, the European Union, and others. Cities of Peace, Inc. has put in place membership policies to ensure compliance with global sanctions.

Lignum vitae,"Lignum vitae (), also called guayacan or guaiacum, and in parts of Europe known as Pockholz or pokhout, is a wood from trees of the genus Guaiacum. The trees are indigenous to the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America (e.g., Colombia and Venezuela) and have been an important export crop to Europe since the beginning of the 16th century. The wood was once very important for applications requiring a material with its extraordinary combination of strength, toughness, and density. It is also the national tree of the Bahamas, and the Jamaican national flower. 
The wood is obtained chiefly from Guaiacum officinale and Guaiacum sanctum, both small, slow-growing trees. All species of the genus Guaiacum are now listed in Appendix II of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) as potentially endangered species. G. sanctum is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. Demand for the wood has been reduced by modern materials science, which has led to polymers, alloys and composite materials that can take lignum vitae's place.
Various other hardwoods may also be called lignum vitae and should not be confused with it. The best-known come from Bulnesia arborea and Bulnesia sarmientoi (in the same subfamily as Guaiacum) and are known as verawood or Argentine lignum vitae; they are somewhat similar in appearance and working qualities as genuine lignum vitae. Note that these species are now Plectrocarpa arborea and Plectrocarpa sarmientoi. Some hardwoods from Australasia (e.g., Vitex lignum-vitae and some species of Acacia and Eucalyptus) are also referred to as lignum vitae.


== Name ==
Lignum vitae is Latin for ""wood of life"". The plant derives its name from its medicinal uses; lignum vitae resin has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions from coughs to arthritis. 
Other names for lignum vitae include palo santo (Spanish for ""holy stick""), Aura palo santo and ""bastard greenheart"" (not to be confused with true greenheart Chlorocardium rodiei, a popular wood in shipbuilding, cabinetry, and woodturning but a completely different timber). Lignum vitae is also one of the numerous hard, dense woods loosely referred to as ""ironwood"".


== Description ==
The tree is slow-growing and relatively small in stature, even when mature and old. It bears small, purplish-blue flowers which result in paired orange dehiscent fruits. The bark is mottled.


=== Wood products ===
Lignum vitae is hard and durable, and is also the densest wood traded (average dried density: ~79 lb/ft3 or ~1,260 kg/m3); it will easily sink in water. On the Janka scale of hardness, which measures hardness of woods, lignum vitae ranks highest of the trade woods, with a Janka hardness of 4,390 lbf (compared with Olneya at 3,260 lbf, African blackwood at 2,940 lbf, hickory at 1,820 lbf, red oak at 1,290 lbf, yellow pine at 690 lbf, and balsa at 100 lbf). The densest of all woods is Allocasuarina luehmannii. Krugiodendron typically has a higher density, among many other woods that vary by sample.


== Uses ==
Because of the density of the wood, cricket bails, in particular ""heavy bails"" used in windy conditions, are sometimes made of lignum vitae. It is also sometimes used to make lawn bowls, croquet mallets, and skittles balls. The wood also has seen widespread historical usage in mortars and pestles and for wood carvers' mallets.
It was the traditional wood used for the British police truncheon until recently because of both its density and its strength, combined with its relative softness compared to metal, thereby tending to bruise rather than cut the skin.
The belaying pins and deadeyes aboard USS Constitution and many other sailing ships were made from lignum vitae. Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the severity of typical marine weathering conditions, and also resist jamming in their mortise holes. The sheaves of blocks on sailing vessels were made of lignum vitae until the introduction of modern synthetics.
Lignum vitae's toughness also allows its use as a lap in the process of cutting gems. The wood is covered with powdered industrial diamond, attached to a spindle, and used to smooth rough surfaces of gems.
Master clockmaker John Harrison used lignum vitae in the bearings and gears of his pendulum clocks and his first three marine chronometers (all of which were large clocks rather than watches), for the wood is self-lubricating. The use of lignum vitae eliminates the need for horological lubricating oil; 18th-century horological oil would become viscous and reduce the accuracy of a timepiece under unfavourable conditions (including those that prevail at sea).
For the same reason it was widely used in water-lubricated shaft bearings for ships and hydro-electric power plants and in the stern-tube bearings of ship propeller shafts until the 1960s saw the introduction of sealed white metal bearings. According to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association website, the shaft bearings on the WWII submarine USS Pampanito (SS-383) were made of this wood. The aft main shaft strut bearings for USS Nautilus (SSN-571), the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, were composed of this wood. Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the Conowingo hydroelectric plant on the lower Susquehanna River were made from lignum vitae. The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from lignum vitae. Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with lignum vitae and are too numerous to be listed here.
The United Railroads of San Francisco (an ancestor of the San Francisco Municipal Railway) began installing insulators made of composite materials to support the heavy 600-volt DC feeder wires for their trolley system in 1904. These lines were damaged, along with most everything else, during the 1906 earthquake and the fires that followed. Rebuilding the trolley system and expanding it to replace cable car routes destroyed in the quake created a huge demand for insulators, a demand manufacturers further east were unable to meet. The properties of lignum vitae, namely its ability to withstand high stress (from heavy cables on long spans and the strain of lines rounding corners) and high temperature (from the feeder cables' becoming very hot during peak operating hours), and its ready availability from the holds of the ships in the harbor (where it served as dunnage and ballast) made it an ideal ""temporary"" solution. Many were still in use well into the 1970s, and the final few were replaced with underground feeder systems in the 2000s.
It was also used extensively in the manufacture of British Railways Mark 1 rolling stock, as a ""bump stop"" in the bogies (the frame that carries the wheels).


== In popular culture ==

Pioneering calypsonian/vaudevillian Sam Manning recorded a song titled ""Lignum Vitae"" in the 1920s.
Benvenuto Cellini recounts using lignum vitae, presumably decocted, to cure himself of a venereal disease, the ""French Pox"", presumably syphilis.
According to T. H. White's version of the Arthurian legend, The Once and Future King, Merlin's wand is made of lignum vitae and has magical powers.

Anti-aging medicine,"Life extension is the concept of extending the human lifespan, either modestly through improvements in medicine or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally-settled biological limit of around 125 years. Several researchers in the area, along with ""life extensionists"", ""immortalists"", or ""longevists"" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), postulate that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition (agerasia). The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists.
The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50 billion of revenue a year in 2009. The use of such hormone products has not been proven to be effective or safe.


== Average life expectancy and lifespan ==

During the process of aging, an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules, cells, tissues, and organs. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by ""genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."" Oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well.
The longest documented human lifespan is 122 years 164 days, the case of Jeanne Calment, who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse, commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant defenses, energy metabolism, proteostasis maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy.
The average life expectancy in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality, which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of life expectancy and lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, vaccinations, good diet, exercise, and avoidance of hazards such as smoking.
Maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes, fruit flies, and mice include caloric restriction, gene manipulation, and administration of pharmaceuticals. Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.
Some animals such as hydra,  planarian flatworms, and certain sponges, corals, and jellyfish do not die of old age and exhibit potential immortality.


== History ==

The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and the Egyptian Smith medical papyrus, all the way through the Taoists, Ayurveda practitioners, alchemists, hygienists such as Luigi Cornaro, Johann Cohausen and Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, and philosophers such as Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Benjamin Franklin and Nicolas Condorcet. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called ""fin-de-siècle"" (end of the century) period, denoted as an ""end of an epoch"" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist Elie Metchnikoff (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.
Sociologist James Hughes claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the Age of Enlightenment. He cites Francis Bacon (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel New Atlantis, wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. Robert Boyle (1627–1691), founding member of the Royal Society, also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as ""to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young"". Biologist Alexis Carrel (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with cells, says Hughes.


=== Contemporary ===
Regulatory and legal struggles between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Life Extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, Saul Kent and Bill Faloon, the principals of the organization, were jailed for four hours and were released on $850,000 bond each. After 11 years of legal battles, Kent and Faloon convinced the US Attorney's Office to dismiss all criminal indictments brought against them by the FDA.
In 2003, Doubleday published ""The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging,"" by Michael D. West. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.
Other modern life extensionists include writer Gennady Stolyarov, who insists that death is ""the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology""; transhumanist philosopher Zoltan Istvan, who proposes that the ""transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else""; futurist George Dvorsky, who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved; and recording artist Steve Aoki, who has been called ""one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension"".


==== Scientific research ====

In 1991, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) was formed. The American Board of Medical Specialties recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.
In 2003, Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel formed the Methuselah Foundation, which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the SENS Research Foundation, a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities. In 2013, Google announced Calico, a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging. It is led by Arthur D. Levinson, and its research team includes scientists such as Hal V. Barron, David Botstein, and Cynthia Kenyon. In 2014, biologist Craig Venter founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.
Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as Harvard and UCLA. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.


== Research ==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by periodic replacement of damaged tissues, molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity.
Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction. A 2009 review of longevity research noted: ""Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a ""life-extension factor"" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology.""


=== Anti-aging drugs ===
There are numerous chemicals intended to slow the aging process under study in animal models. One type of research is related to the observed effects of a calorie restriction (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals. Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a CR diet, which are known as caloric restriction mimetic drugs, such as rapamycin and metformin.
Sirtuin activating polyphenols, such as resveratrol and pterostilbene, and flavonoids, such as quercetin and fisetin, as well as oleic acid are dietary supplements that have also been studied in this context. Other common supplements with less clear biological pathways to target aging include lipoic acid, senolytics, and coenzyme Q10. 
While agents such as these have some limited laboratory evidence of efficacy in animals, there are no studies to date in humans for drugs that may promote life extension, mainly because research investment remains at a low level, and regulatory standards are high. Aging is not recognized as a preventable condition by governments, indicating there is no clear pathway to approval of anti-aging medications. Further, anti-aging drug candidates are under constant review by regulatory authorities like the US Food and Drug Administration, which stated in 2023 that ""no medication has been proven to slow or reverse the aging process.""


=== Nanotechnology ===
Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular computers, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book The Singularity Is Near that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a medical use for Feynman's theoretical nanomachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) ""swallow the doctor"". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.


=== Cyborgs ===

Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the 2045 Initiative.


=== Cryonics ===

Cryonics is the low-temperature freezing (usually at −196 °C or −320.8 °F or 77.1 K) of a human corpse, with the hope that resuscitation may be possible in the future. It is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community and has been characterized as quackery.


=== Strategies for engineered negligible senescence ===

Another proposed life extension technology aims to combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of stem cells and tissue engineering, telomere-lengthening machinery, allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins, targeted ablation of cells, immunotherapeutic clearance, and novel lysosomal hydrolases.
While some biogerontologists find these ideas ""worthy of discussion"", others contend that the alleged benefits are too speculative given the current state of technology, referring to it as ""fantasy rather than science"".


== Genetic editing ==

Genome editing, in which nucleic acid polymers are delivered as a drug and are either expressed as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.


=== CRISPR/Cas9 ===

CRISPR/Cas9 edits genes by precisely cutting DNA and then harnessing natural DNA repair processes to modify the gene in the desired manner. The system has two components: the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA.  A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in nematode worms.

In July 2020 scientists, using public biological data on 1.75 m people with known lifespans overall, identify 10 genomic loci which appear to intrinsically influence healthspan, lifespan, and longevity – of which half have not been reported previously at genome-wide significance and most being associated with cardiovascular disease – and identify haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. Their study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans. The same month other scientists report that yeast cells of the same genetic material and within the same environment age in two distinct ways, describe a biomolecular mechanism that can determine which process dominates during aging and genetically engineer a novel aging route with substantially extended lifespan.


=== Fooling genes ===
In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins describes an approach to life-extension that involves ""fooling genes"" into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by ""identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body"".


=== Cloning and body part replacement ===
Some life extensionists suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. In 2008, the US Department of Defense announced a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease. Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.
The use of human stem cells, particularly embryonic stem cells, is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations. Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.
The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to reproductive cloning. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.


== Ethics and politics ==


=== Scientific controversy ===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, Leonard Hayflick, who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50 cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy. Hayflick and fellow biogerontologists Jay Olshansky and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements.


=== Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.


=== Political parties ===
Though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces working both for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.


=== Silicon Valley ===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon), Larry Ellison (founder of Oracle), Peter Thiel (former PayPal CEO), Larry Page (co-founder of Google), Peter Diamandis, Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI, invested in Retro Biosciences), and Brian Armstrong (founder of Coinbase and NewLimit), Bryan Johnson (Founder of Kernel).


=== Commentators ===
Leon Kass (chairman of the US President's Council on Bioethics from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of overpopulation problems would make life extension unethical. He states his opposition to life extension with the words:

""simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and narcissistic wish incompatible with devotion to posterity.""
John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.
Transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few. In an extended metaphor entitled ""The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant"", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.


=== Overpopulation concerns ===
Controversy about life extension is due to fear of overpopulation and possible effects on society. Biogerontologist Aubrey De Grey counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate menopause, allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus decreasing the yearly population growth rate. Moreover, the philosopher and futurist Max More argues that, given that the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.


=== Opinion polls ===
A Spring 2013 Pew Research poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an ""ideal lifespan"" to be more than 120 years. The median ""ideal lifespan"" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society. One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.
Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated, though some variation exists between religious denominations.


=== Aging as a disease ===
Most mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. Biologist David Sinclair says: ""I don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body."" The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not. However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for AARP, notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context. David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease. In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that Basenji are not dogs because they do not bark. Because of the universality of aging he calls it a ""special sort of disease"". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms ""aging syndrome"" and ""disease complex"" in 1954 to describe aging.
The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.


== Beliefs and methods ==


=== Senolytics and prolongevity drugs ===

Senolytics eliminate senescent cells whereas senomorphics – with candidates such as Apigenin, Everolimus and Rapamycin – modulate properties of senescent cells without eliminating them, suppressing phenotypes of senescence, including the SASP. Senomorphic effects may be one major effect mechanism of a range of prolongevity drug candidates. Such candidates are however typically not studied for just one mechanism, but multiple. There are biological databases of prolongevity drug candidates under research as well as of potential gene/protein targets. These are enhanced by longitudinal cohort studies, electronic health records, computational (drug) screening methods, computational biomarker-discovery methods and computational biodata-interpretation/personalized medicine methods.
Besides rapamycin and senolytics, the drug-repurposing candidates studied most extensively include metformin, acarbose, spermidine and NAD+ enhancers.
Many prolongevity drugs are synthetic alternatives or potential complements to existing nutraceuticals, such as various sirtuin-activating compounds under investigation like SRT2104. In some cases pharmaceutical administration is combined with that of neutraceuticals – such as in the case of glycine combined with NAC. Often studies are structured based on or thematize specific prolongevity targets, listing both nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals (together or separately) such as FOXO3-activators.
Researchers are also exploring ways to mitigate side-effects from such substances (possibly most notably rapamycin and its derivatives) such as via protocols of intermittent administration and have called for research that helps determine optimal treatment schedules (including timing) in general.


=== Diets and supplements ===


==== Vitamins and antioxidants ====

The free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life. Reviews, however, have found that use of vitamin A (as β-carotene) and vitamin E supplements possibly can increase mortality. Other reviews have found no relationship between vitamin E and other vitamins with mortality. Vitamin D supplementation of various dosages is investigated in trials and there also is research into GlyNAC (see above).


==== Complications ====
Complications of antioxidant supplementation (especially continuous high dosages far above the RDA) include that reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are mitigated by antioxidants, ""have been found to be physiologically vital for signal transduction, gene regulation, and redox regulation, among others, implying that their complete elimination would be harmful"". In particular, one way of multiple they can be detrimental is by inhibiting adaptation to exercise such as muscle hypertrophy (e.g. during dedicated periods of caloric surplus). There is also research into stimulating/activating/fueling endogenous antioxidant generation, in particular e.g. of neutraceutical glycine and pharmaceutical NAC. Antioxidants can change the oxidation status of different e.g. tissues, targets or sites each with potentially different implications, especially for different concentrations. A review suggests mitochondria have a hormetic response to ROS, whereby low oxidative damage can be beneficial.


==== Dietary restriction ====

As of 2021, there is no clinical evidence that any dietary restriction practice contributes to human longevity.


==== Healthy diet ====
Research suggests that increasing adherence to Mediterranean diet patterns is associated with a reduction in total and cause-specific mortality, extending health- and lifespan. Research is identifying the key beneficial components of the Mediterranean diet. Studies suggest dietary changes are a factor of national relative rises in life-span.


==== Optimal diet ====

Approaches to develop optimal diets for health- and lifespan (or ""longevity diets"") include:

modifying the Mediterranean diet as the baseline via nutrition science. For instance, via:
(additional) increase in plant-based foods alongside additional restriction of meat intake – meat reduction is (or can be) typically healthy,
keeping alcohol consumption of any type at a minimum – conventional Mediterranean diets include alcohol consumption (i.e. of wine), which is under research due to data suggesting negative long-term brain impacts even at low/moderate consumption levels.
fully replacing refined grains – some guidelines of Mediterranean diets do not clarify or include the principle of whole-grain consumption instead of refined grains. Whole grains are included in Mediterranean diets.


=== Other approaches ===
Further advanced biosciences-based approaches include:

Genetic and epigenetic alterations: Human genetic enhancement for pro-longevity and protective genes – see genetics of aging
Cellular reprogramming': in vivo reprogramming to complement or augment human regenerative capacity and rejuvenate or replace cells
Epigenetic reprogramming: early-stage research about rejuvenating/repairing epigenetic machinery
Stem-cell interventions: ""Increasing the number and quality of stem cells and activate regenerative signals""
Nanomedicine: early-stage research of in vivo pro-longevity nanotechnology
Tissue engineering: of tissues and organs (see also: xenotransplantation and artificial organ)
Endogenous circulating biomolecules: Blood proteins of blood from young animals have shown some pro-longevity potential in animal studies (e.g. via transfer of blood or plasma, and of plasma proteins). Moreover, exerkines – signalling biomolecules released during/after exercise – have also shown promising results. Exerkines include myokines. Extracellular vesicles were shown to be secreted concomitantly with exerkines and are also investigated. (See also: body fluid and cerebrospinal fluid)
Personalized interventions: future studies may tailor and investigate personalized medicine-type interventions For instance, effects of interventions or e.g. dosages may vary per age and/or genome. A review suggests that the field of precision medicine and geroscience will have to interact closely (see also: combination therapy)
Peptides: such as MOTS-c released by mitochondria
Mitochondria modulation: early-stage research indicates mitochondrial interventions such as mitochondrial transplantation may have potential to be efficacious (See also: mitochondrial theory of ageing)


==== Within the field ====

There is a need and research into the development of aging biomarkers such as the epigenetic clock ""to assess the ageing process and the efficacy of interventions to bypass the need for large-scale longitudinal studies"". Such biomarkers may also include in vivo brain imaging.
Reviews sometimes include structured tables that provide systematic overviews of intervention/drug candidates with a review calling for integrating ""current knowledge with multi-omics, health records, and drug safety data to predict drugs that can improve health in late life"" and listing major outstanding questions. Biological databases of prolongevity drug candidates under research as well as of potential gene/protein targets include GenAge, DrugAge and Geroprotectors.
A review has pointed out that the approach of ""'epidemiological' comparison of how a low versus a high consumption of an isolated macronutrient and its association with health and mortality may not only fail to identify protective or detrimental nutrition patterns but may lead to misleading interpretations"". It proposes a multi-pillar approach, and summarizes findings towards constructing – multi-system-considering and at least age-personalized dynamic – refined longevity diets. Epidemiological-type observational studies included in meta-analyses should according to the study at least be complemented by ""(1) basic research focused on lifespan and healthspan, (2) carefully controlled clinical trials, and (3) studies of individuals and populations with record longevity"".


=== Hormone treatment ===
The anti-aging industry offers several hormone therapies. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the American Medical Association has b",1
Travel technology,"Travel technology (also called tourism technology, and hospitality automation) is the application of Information Technology (IT) or Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the travel, tourism and hospitality industry.  Some forms of travel technology are flight tracking, pre-travel planning through online travel agencies, and systems that allow tourists to review their experiences.
Travel technology was originally associated with the computer reservations system (CRS) of the airlines industry, but is now used more inclusively, incorporating the broader tourism sector as well as its subset the hospitality industry.


== Online travel agencies ==
Booking engines allow easy access for consumers and travel professionals; the systems enable individuals to make reservations and compare prices. Online travel agencies such as expedia.com, are a large contribution to how the travel and tourism industries have changed due to technology. These online agencies help users plan and book trips and provide comparisons of hotels, flights, vacation packages, prices and more, all in one place. The change from of-person to online travel agencies gives the customer more power in planning their trip.


== Customer reviews ==
The increase in review websites has also had a huge impact on the tourism industry. Sites such as tripadvisor.com let users read, post, and interact with reviews of travel experiences and attractions others have had. eWOM, meaning electronic word of mouth, has become a big influence in consumer’s attitudes and actions, resulting in different choices of products and planning aspects.


== Social media and mobile technologies ==
The introduction of smartphones and mobile applications has also had a big effect on the tourism industry. Social media posts allow users to gather general information, free of marketing bias. GPS and social media apps allow users to tag and share their locations. People no longer need to print out directions and can use map apps to help them get around. Social media users can search for locations on social media platforms and gain more knowledge of the locations without using a review site.
Applications such as Uber and Lyft have also made travelling easier. Users no longer have to plan ahead for transportation to and from an airport or a different destination. Ubers and Lyfts may also be used in place of a rental car.


== Mobile communication ==
Today the tour guide can be a GPS tour guide, and the guidebook could be an audioguide and trips could be planned completely online. The continuing evolution of information technology and the widespread public use of the Internet has created a number of conditions that have been both beneficial and detrimental to the modern travel agency. The internet is reshaping many business aspects. As a result, the travel and tourism industries will have to continue to adapt to new technologies in the future.

Shah Amanat was born into a Muslim family of Iraqi Arab origin. His forefathers migrated from Baghdad to Bihar; they were descendants of Abdul Qadir Gilani. His father's name was Niyamat. Shah Amanat later migrated to Bengal. In Murshidabad, Shah Amanat became a disciple of and pledged bay'ah to a Kashmiri Sufi scholar by the name of Shah Abdur Rahim Rizvi, for a number of years. Shah Abdur Rahim was the grandson of Khwaja Masum, the son of Ahmad Sirhindi. Shah Amanat travelled across the subcontinent to learn about Islam in places such as Delhi, Lucknow and Kashmir.
After 12 years, Shah Abdur Rahim advised Shah Amanat to migrate to Chittagong. Shah Amanat built himself a small cottage in a forest area in Chittagong to live in. He managed to get a job as a punkah wallah at the Chittagong Judge Court, and preferred a simple lifestyle without attracting much attention. He would attend prayers at Nawab Yasin Khan's Qadam Mubarak mosque. It was from this career at the court that he was nicknamed Meah Saheb. However, after people realised his true identity, Shah Amanat began dedicating more of his public life towards religious propagation. Shah Amanat established Khanqah Amanatiya to preach Islam and Naqshbandiya, Mujaddedia, Qadirriyya, Chishtiya and Madariya Sufi order. Khanqah Amanatiya later became a Sufi hub in Bangladesh. One of his first disciple was Shah Sufi Muhammad Dayem of Dayera Sharif, Azimpur who later left for Azimabad. He had numerous disciples spread across the Indian Subcontinent.


== Death and legacy ==
In 1773, at the age of 125 years this great Sufi mystic passed away leaving the Khanqah Amanatiya and his estate in the hands of his only son Shahzada Muhammad Anwar Khan and was buried near his Khanqah in a mazar (mausoleum). It is currently in the city of Chittagong; east of the Laldighi, Kotwali.


== Successors' history ==
Shah Amanat Khan left his Sufi dynasty to his only son Anwar Khan, also known as Shahzada Muhammad Anwar Khan. The successor of the Sufi dynasty is known as Sajjada Nashin, who serves the people.
Shahzada Alef Khan, only son of Shahzada Muhammad Anwar Khan, died before his father, leaving behind his son Shahzada Aliyar Khan. Shahzada Aliyar Khan became the Sajjada Nashin of the Dargah Sharif and Khanqah Amanatiya after his grand father Shahzada Anwar Khan died shortly after 1840 AD. He continued the legacy and managed Khanqah Amanatiya. The amount of free meals also known as Langar was increased at his time as people visiting the Dargah Sharif increased considerably. This system of providing Langar was established by Shah Sufi Amanat Khan in his Khanqah and continued till date by the Sajjada Nashins.
Shahzada Fazr Ali Khan, only son of Shahzada Aliyar Khan succeeded his father as the Sajjada Nashin of Dargah Sharif and Khanqah Amanatiya. After living a glorious Sufi life he died in 1890 AD leaving the Khanqah and Dargah Sharif on his son Shahzada Sher Ali Khan's responsibility.
Shahzada Sher Ali Khan had four sons: Shahzada Fouzul Kabir Khan (1914–1982), Shahzada Fouzul Azim Khan (1920–1978), Shahzada Fouzul Karim Khan (1923–1962), and Shahzada Fouzul Ali Khan (1935–2009). In 1942, when Shahzada Sher Ali Khan died, his four sons became the Sajjada Nashin of Dargah Sharif and Khanqah Amanatiya, and continued to serve the people and the path of Sufism. The sons of the four brothers became the Sajjada Nashin, the dynasty is currently under the supervision of them - the seventh generation of Shah Sufi Amanat Khan.


== Influence ==
Shah Sufi Amanat Khan's Dargah has been a place where people from different religions interconnect. His influence among the Bangladeshi people can be seen through the village songs, Sufi qawalis, and shops, institutions after his name. His name can also be seen on the body of many vehicles in Chittagong. Most of the Sufi lineages of Bangladesh comes from him.
The famous Shah Amanat Bridge was named after him. In Halishahar, there is a school named after Shah Amanat called the Shah Amanat Shishu Niketan. There is also a power and energy company called Shah Amanat Prakritik Gas Co. Ltd. owned by S. Alam Group of Industries. Shah Amanat International Airport was also named after him.

Arts and crafts,"Arts and crafts describes a wide variety of activities involving making things with one's own hands.  Arts and crafts is usually a hobby. Some crafts (art skills) have been practised since preshistoric times, others are more recent inventions. William Morris, John Ruskin and others promoted an ""arts and crafts"" movement in the late 19th century, which popularized the phrase.
Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts. Children in schools may learn skills such as woodworking, wood carving, sewing, or making things with all sorts of material. Many community centres and schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn arts and craft skills

Burke–Schumann limit,"In combustion, Burke–Schumann limit, or large Damköhler number limit, is the limit of infinitely fast chemistry (or in other words, infinite Damköhler number), named after S.P. Burke and T.E.W. Schumann, due to their pioneering work on Burke–Schumann flame. One important conclusion of infinitely fast chemistry is the non-co-existence of fuel and oxidizer simultaneously except in a thin reaction sheet. The inner structure of the reaction sheet is described by Liñán's equation.


== Limit description ==
In a typical non-premixed combustion (fuel and oxidizer are separated initially), mixing of fuel and oxidizer takes place based on the mechanical time scale

i.e., fuel and oxidizer cannot coexist, since far away from the reaction sheet, only one of the reactant is available (non premixed). On the fuel side of the reaction sheet, 
  
    
      
        
          Y

    {\displaystyle Y_{F}=0}

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Da} \sim O(1)}
  
 (diffusive transport will be comparable to reaction in this zone). In this thin reaction sheet, both fuel and oxygen are consumed and nothing leaks to the other side of the sheet. Due to the instantaneous consumption of fuel and oxidizer, the normal gradients of scalars exhibit discontinuities at the reaction sheet.

Privacy by design,"Privacy by design (PbD) is an idea in systems engineering and information technology.
In privacy by design, the engineers build the system so that it keeps information private starting at the beginning instead of building the system and then adding privacy protection later.  In privacy by design, the designers treat privacy protection as just as important as other parts of the design.


== History ==
Dr. Ann Cavoukian first said the term ""Privacy by Design"" when she was the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. Dr. Cavoukian later wrote about the ""7 foundational principles"" of privacy by design in the 1990s.
The European GDPR regulation incorporates privacy by design which revolves around the following foundational principles:


== Foundational principles ==


=== Privacy by Design is based on seven foundational principles ===
Privacy First
Privacy as the default setting
Privacy inside of design
Full functionality
End-to-end security
Keep it open
Keep user centered
The authors of more than five hundred other articles have talked about these principles by citing the white paper ""Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice"" by Ann Cavoukian. Privacy by Design is accepted as the gold standard internationally.

Asset management,"Asset management is a systematic approach to the governance and realization of all value for which a group or entity is responsible. It may apply both to tangible assets (physical objects such as complex process or manufacturing plants, infrastructure, buildings or equipment) and to intangible assets (such as intellectual property, goodwill or financial assets). Asset management is a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost-effective manner (including all costs, risks, and performance attributes).
Theory of asset management primarily deals with the periodic matter of improving, maintaining or in other circumstances assuring the economic and capital value of an asset over time. The term is commonly used in engineering, the business world, and public infrastructure sectors to ensure a coordinated approach to the optimization of costs, risks, service/performance, and sustainability. The term has traditionally been used in the financial sector to describe people and companies who manage investments on behalf of others. Those include, for example, investment managers who manage the assets of a pension fund.
The ISO 55000 series of standards, developed by ISO TC 251, are the international standards for Asset Management. ISO 55000 provides an introduction and requirements specification for a management system for asset management. The ISO 55000 standard defines an asset as an ""item, thing or entity that has potential or actual value to an organization"". ISO 55001 specifies requirements for an asset management system within the context of the organization, and ISO 55002 gives guidelines for the application of an asset management system, in accordance with the requirements of ISO 55001.


== By industry ==


=== Financial asset management ===
The most frequent usage of the term portfolio manager (asset manager) refers to investment management, the sector of the financial services industry that manages investment funds and segregated client accounts. Asset management is part of a financial company that employs experts who manage money and handle the investments of clients. This is done either actively or passively.

Active asset management: involves active tasks such as studying the client's assets to plan and look after the investments, all things are looked after by the asset managers, and recommendations are provided based on the financial health of each client. Active asset management comes at a higher price to investors because more work is involved.
Passive asset management: assets are allocated to mirror a market or a sector index. Unlike active asset management, passive asset management is a lot less laborious. It is also less tailored, requires less looking after, and consequently is cheaper for investors. Benjamin Braun suggests that, since American stock ownership is concentrated on few big asset managers which are very diversified and do not have a direct interest in the performance of the companies, this emerging ""asset manager capitalism"" is distinct from the earlier shareholder primacy.


=== Physical and Infrastructure asset management ===

Physical and Infrastructure asset management is the combination of management, financial, economic, engineering, and other practices applied to physical assets to provide the best value level of service for the costs involved. It includes the management of the entire life cycle—including design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing, and decommissioning/disposal—of physical and infrastructure assets. Operation and maintenance of assets in a constrained budget environment require a prioritization scheme. As a way of illustration, the recent development of renewable energy has seen the rise of effective asset managers involved in the management of solar systems (solar parks, rooftops, and windmills). These teams often collaborate with financial asset managers in order to offer turnkey solutions to investors. 
Infrastructure asset management became very important in most of the developed countries in the 21st century, since their infrastructure network was almost completed in the 20th century and they have to manage to operate and maintain them cost-effectively.
Physical, or Infrastructure Asset Management is a growing specialist engineering discipline, with many international technical societies now established to advance knowledge in this area, including the Engineers Australia technical society of the Asset Management Council (AMC), the World Partners in Asset Management (WPiAM), Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals (SMRP), the Institute of Asset Management (IAM), the International Society of Engineering Asset Management (ISEAM), and the Global Forum on Maintenance and Asset Management (GFMAM).


=== Engineering asset management ===
Engineering asset management is a more recent term that is used to describe the management of complex physical assets, a specific engineering practice that is concerned with optimizing assets, in the context of the organizations goals and objectives, through using multidiscipline engineering methodologies, and Terotechnology (which includes management, engineering, and financial expertise), to balance cost, risk, and performance. Engineering asset management includes multiple engineering disciplines, including but not limited to maintenance engineering, systems engineering, reliability engineering, process safety management, industrial engineering, and risk analysis. Engineering asset management is a term synonymous with physical and infrastructure asset management, it is used to describe management of more complex physical assets which require the application of specialist asset management engineering methods over their life-cycles in order to maximize value for their owners, whilst keeping risk to an acceptable level.


=== Software asset management ===

SAM is a sub-discipline of IT asset management.


=== International Standard series on Asset Management ===
The International Organization for Standardization published its management system standard for asset management in 2014. The ISO 55000 series provides terminology, requirements, and guidance for implementing, maintaining and improving an effective asset management system. The key to forming a structure of this sort is directly connected to local governance. 

Physical asset management: the practice of managing the entire life cycle (design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing, and decommissioning/disposal) of physical and infrastructure assets such as structures, production, and service plant, power, water, and waste treatment facilities, distribution networks, transport systems, buildings, and other physical assets.  The increasing availability of data from asset systems is allowing the principles of Total Cost of Ownership to be applied to facility management of an individual system, a building, or across a campus.  Physical asset management is related to asset health management.
Infrastructure asset management expands on this theme in relation primarily to the public sector, utilities, property, and transport systems. Additionally, Asset Management can refer to shaping the future interfaces between the human, built, and natural environments through collaborative and evidence-based decision processes
Fixed assets management: an accounting process that seeks to track fixed assets for financial accounting
IT asset management: the set of business practices that join financial, contractual, and inventory functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making for the IT environment.
Digital asset management: a form of electronic media content management that includes digital assets


=== Enterprise asset management ===
Enterprise asset management (EAM) systems are asset information systems that support the management of an organization's assets.   An EAM includes an asset registry (inventory of assets and their attributes) combined with a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) and other modules (such as inventory or materials management). Assets that are geographically distributed, interconnected or networked, are often also represented through the use of geographic information systems (GIS).
GIS-centric asset registry standardizes data and improves interoperability, providing users the capability to reuse, coordinate, and share information efficiently and effectively. A GIS platform combined with information of both the ""hard"" and ""soft"" assets helps to remove the traditional silos of departmental functions. While the hard assets are the typical physical assets or infrastructure assets, the soft assets might include permits, licenses, brands, patents, right-of-ways, and other entitlements or valued items.
The EAM system is only one of the 'enablers' of good asset management.  Asset managers need to make informed decisions to fulfill their organizational goals, this requires good asset information but also leadership, clarity of strategic priorities, competencies, inter-departmental collaboration and communications, workforce, and supply chain engagement, risk and change management systems, performance monitoring, and continual improvement.


=== Public asset management ===
Public asset management expands the definition of enterprise asset management (EAM) by incorporating the management of all things of value to a municipal jurisdiction and its citizens' expectations. An example in which public asset management is used is land-use development and planning.


== Intellectual and non-physical asset management ==
Increasingly both consumers and organizations use assets, e.g. software, music, books, etc. where the user's rights are constrained by a license agreement. An asset management system would identify the constraints upon such licenses, e.g. a period. If, for example, one licenses software, often the license is for a given period. Adobe and Microsoft both offer time-based software licenses. In both the corporate and consumer worlds, there is a distinction between software ownership and the updating of software. One may own a version of the software, but not newer versions of the software. Cellular phones are often not updated by vendors, in an attempt to force a purchase of newer hardware. Large companies such as Oracle, that license software to clients distinguish between the right to use and the right to receive maintenance/support.

HHVM,"HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is an open-source virtual machine based on just-in-time (JIT) compilation that serves as an execution engine for the Hack programming language and used to support PHP execution before the release of HHVM version 4. By using the principle of JIT compilation, Hack code is first transformed into intermediate HipHop bytecode (HHBC), which is then dynamically translated into x86-64 machine code, optimized, and natively executed.  This contrasts with PHP's usual interpreted execution, in which the Zend Engine transforms PHP source code into opcodes that serve as a form of bytecode, and executes the opcodes directly on the Zend Engine's virtual CPU.
HHVM is developed by Facebook, with the project's source code hosted on GitHub; it is licensed under the terms of the PHP License and Zend License.

Olea capensis,"Olea capensis, the black ironwood, is an African tree species in the olive family Oleaceae. It is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa: from the east in Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan, south to the tip of South Africa, and west to Cameroon, Sierra Leone and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, as well as Madagascar and the Comoros. It occurs in bush, littoral scrub and evergreen forest.
Other common names in English include ironwood, ironwood olive, East African olive and Elgon olive.


== Description ==
The black ironwood is a bushy shrub, or a small to medium-sized tree, up to 10 metres (33 ft) in height, occasionally reaching 40 metres (130 ft).

Bark: light grey, becoming dark grey and vertically fissured with age; a characteristic blackish gum is exuded from bark wounds.
Leaves: light to dark green and glossy above and paler green below; petiole often purplish, 0.3–1.7 cm long; lanceolate-oblong to almost circular, 3–10 x 1.5–5 cm.
Flowers: white or cream and sweetly scented, small and in many flowered axillary or terminal heads, bisexual, 3–15 cm long.
Fruit: when ripe they are somewhat succulent purplish drupes; ovoid up to 2 x 1 cm.


=== Subspecies ===
The species has been divided into 3 subspecies: 

Olea capensis subsp. macrocarpa: flowers in lax heads, fruits oblong to elliptic.
Olea capensis subsp. capensis: flowers in dense heads, leaves very variable, apex often rounded, and fruits almost spherical to oblong elliptic.
Olea capensis subsp. enervis: leaves usually broadly elliptic, apex tapering.


== Uses ==


=== Food ===
Olea capensis has masses of sweetly scented bisexual flowers, that produce large edible fruits.


=== Timber ===
The wood of the tree is very hard, fine grained, and heavy, and although difficult to work, it is widely used for art and artifacts. 


=== Gardens ===
Olea capensis is cultivated as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens.
The Guinness Book of World Records lists this tree as the world's heaviest wood, with a specific gravity of 1.49, similar to that of anthracite or dry earth. It is known for its tendency to sink in water, unlike other wood materials. It is also one of the world's hardest woods according to the Janka hardness test. The timber has a good abrasion resistance and is very strong. It is an excellent turnery wood, and is used for a wide range of decorative items.

Character animation,"Character animation is a specialized area of the animation process, which involves bringing animated characters to life. The role of a character animator is analogous to that of a film or stage actor and character animators are often said to be ""actors with a pencil"" (or a mouse). Character animators breathe life in their characters, creating the illusion of thought, emotion and personality. Character animation is often distinguished from creature animation, which involves bringing photorealistic animals and creatures to life. 


== Origins ==

Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur (1914) is often considered the first example of true character animation. Later, Otto Messmer imbued Felix the Cat with an instantly recognizable personality during the 1920s.
In the 1930s, Walt Disney made character animation a particular focus of his animation studio, best showcased in productions such as Three Little Pigs (1933), Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and Dumbo (1941). Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the ""first full length animated and musical feature"" in Technicolor. Disney animators such as Bill Tytla, Ub Iwerks, Grim Natwick, Fred Moore, Ward Kimball, Les Clark, John Sibley, Marc Davis, Wolfgang Reitherman, Hal King, Hamilton Luske, Norm Ferguson, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston all became masters of the technique.
Frank and Ollie, as they were affectionately known by their protégés, taught that the thoughts and emotions behind the character were primary to the creation of every scene. Out of all the Nine Old Men, Frank and Ollie were the most known for their mentor/apprentice relationships, and the sharing of their knowledge about creating characters, most notably as transcribed through Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life. This book relays the 12 basic principles of animation, and is informally considered to be the 'animation bible' for any student of animation.
Other notable figures in character animation include the Schlesinger/Warner Bros. directors (Tex Avery, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Frank Tashlin, Robert McKimson, and Friz Freleng), cartoon animators Max Fleischer and Walter Lantz, pioneering animators Hanna-Barbera, former Disney animator Don Bluth, independent animator Richard Williams, John Lasseter at Pixar, and latter-day Disney animators Andreas Deja, Glen Keane and Eric Goldberg. Character animation is not limited to Hollywood studios, however. Some of the finest examples of character animation can be found in the work of Nick Park of Aardman Animations and Russian independent animator Yuri Norstein.


== Games ==
Though typical examples of character animation are found in animated feature films, the role of character animation within the gaming industry is rapidly increasing. Game developers are using more complicated characters that allow the gamer to more fully connect with the gaming experience. Prince of Persia, God of War, Team Fortress or Resident Evil contain examples of character animation in games.


== Visual effects and creature animation ==

Character animation is often contrasted with creature animation, in which specialised animators bring to life realistic animals and creatures, such as dinosaurs and fantasy creatures. Visual effects animators specialise in animating vehicles, machinery, and natural phenomena such as rain, snow, lightning and water, as well as the ""non-natural"" effects often seen in science fiction films. There is a good deal of overlap between these areas. Sometimes, visual effects animators will use the same principles of character animation; an early example is the pseudopod in The Abyss.
On-going computer science research on character animation deals with the question of generating multi-layer level of detail at run-time to allow large crowd rendering in real-time applications. Realistic character movements are often simulated using motion capture and soft-body dynamics simulations.

Entry point,"In computer programming, an entry point is the place in a program where the execution of a program begins, and where the program has access to command line arguments.
To start a program's execution, the loader or operating system passes control to its entry point. (During booting, the operating system itself is the program). This marks the transition from load time (and dynamic link time, if present) to run time.
For some operating systems and programming languages, the entry point is in a runtime library, a set of support functions for the language. The library code initializes the program and then passes control to the program proper. In other cases, the program may initialize the runtime library itself. 
In simple systems, execution begins at the first statement, which is common in interpreted languages, simple executable formats, and boot loaders. In other cases, the entry point is at some other known memory address which can be an absolute address or relative address (offset).
Alternatively, execution of a program can begin at a named point, either with a conventional name defined by the programming language or operating system or at a caller-specified name. In many C-family languages, this is a function called main; as a result, the entry point is often known as the main function.
In JVM languages, such as Java, the entry point is a static method called main; in CLI languages such as C# the entry point is a static method named Main.


== Usage ==
Entry points apply both to source code and to executable files. However, in day-to-day software development, programmers specify the entry points only in source code, which makes them much better known. Entry points in executable files depend on the application binary interface (ABI) of the actual operating system, and are generated by the compiler or linker (if not fixed by the ABI). Other linked object files may also have entry points, which are used later by the linker when generating entry points of an executable file.
Entry points are capable of passing on command arguments, variables, or other information as a local variable used by the Main() method. This way, specific options may be set upon execution of the program, and then interpreted by the program. Many programs use this as an alternative way to configure different settings, or perform a set variety of actions using a single program.


=== Contemporary ===
In most of today's popular programming languages and operating systems, a computer program usually only has a single entry point.
In C, C++, D, Zig, Rust and Kotlin programs this is a function named main; in Java it is a static method named main (although the class must be specified at the invocation time), and in C# it is a static method named Main.
In many major operating systems, the standard executable format has a single entry point. In the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), used in Unix and Unix-like systems such as Linux, the entry point is specified in the e_entry field of the ELF header. In the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc), the entry point used by the linker is the _start symbol. Similarly, in the Portable Executable format, used in Microsoft Windows, the entry point is specified by the AddressOfEntryPoint field, which is inherited from COFF. In COM files, the entry point is at the fixed offset of 0100h.
One exception to the single-entry-point paradigm is Android.  Android applications do not have a single entry point –  there is no special main function. Instead, they have essential components (activities and services) which the system can load and run as needed.
An occasionally used technique is the fat binary, which consists of several executables for different targets packaged in a single file. Most commonly, this is implemented by a single overall entry point, which is compatible with all targets and branches to the target-specific entry point. Alternative techniques include storing separate executables in separate forks, each with its own entry point, which is then selected by the operating system.


=== Historical ===
Historically, and in some contemporary legacy systems, such as VMS and OS/400, computer programs have a multitude of entry points, each corresponding to the different functionalities of the program. The usual way to denote entry points, as used system-wide in VMS and in PL/I and MACRO programs, is to append them at the end of the name of the executable image, delimited by a dollar sign ($), e.g. directory.exe$make.
The Apple I computer also used this to some degree. For example, an alternative entry point in Apple I's BASIC would keep the BASIC program useful when the reset button was accidentally pushed.


== Exit point ==
In general, programs can exit at any time by returning to the operating system or crashing. Programs in interpreted languages return control to the interpreter, but programs in compiled languages must return to the operating system, otherwise the processor will simply continue executing beyond the end of the program, resulting in undefined behavior.
Usually, there is not a single exit point specified in a program. However, in other cases runtimes ensure that programs always terminate in a structured way via a single exit point, which is guaranteed unless the runtime itself crashes; this allows cleanup code to be run, such as atexit handlers. This can be done by either requiring that programs terminate by returning from the main function, by calling a specific exit function, or by the runtime catching exceptions or operating system signals.


== Programming languages ==
In many programming languages, the main function is where a program starts its execution. It enables high-level organization of the program's functionality, and typically has access to the command arguments given to the program when it was executed.
The main function is generally the first programmer-written function that runs when a program starts, and is invoked directly from the system-specific initialization contained in the runtime environment (crt0 or equivalent). However, some languages can execute user-written functions before main runs, such as the constructors of C++ global objects.
In other languages, notably many interpreted languages, execution begins at the first statement in the program.
A non-exhaustive list of programming languages follows, describing their way of defining the main entry point:


=== APL ===
In APL, when a workspace is loaded, the contents of ""quad LX"" (latent expression) variable is interpreted as an APL expression and executed.


=== C and C++ ===
In C and C++, the function prototype of the main function must be equivalent to one of the following:

Main function looks like entry point for application programmers (the application's entry point or main entry point). System programming reveals more information about the program, and specifies the entry point elsewhere (in initialization procedure, or in reset interrupt vector for standalone programs).
The parameters argc, argument count, and argv, argument vector, respectively give the number and values of the program's command-line arguments. The names of argc and argv may be any valid identifier in C, but it is common convention to use these names. In C++, the names are to be taken literally, and the ""void"" in the parameter list is to be omitted, if strict conformance is desired. Other platform-dependent formats are also allowed by the C and C++ standards, except that in C++ the return type must always be int; for example, Unix (though not POSIX.1) and Windows have a third argument giving the program's environment, otherwise accessible through getenv in stdlib.h:

Darwin-based operating systems, such as macOS, have a fourth parameter containing arbitrary OS-supplied information, such as the path to the executing binary:

The value returned from the main function becomes the exit status of the process, though the C standard only ascribes specific meaning to two values: EXIT_SUCCESS (traditionally 0) and EXIT_FAILURE. The meaning of other possible return values is implementation-defined. In case a return value is not defined by the programmer, an implicit return 0; at the end of the main() function is inserted by the compiler; this behavior is required by the C++ standard.
It is guaranteed that argc is non-negative and that argv[argc] is a null pointer. By convention, the command-line arguments specified by argc and argv include the name of the program as the first element if argc is greater than 0; if a user types a command of ""rm file"", the shell will initialise the rm process with argc = 2 and argv = {""rm"", ""file"", NULL}.  As argv[0] is the name that processes appear under in ps, top etc., some programs, such as daemons or those running within an interpreter or virtual machine (where argv[0] would be the name of the host executable), may choose to alter their argv to give a more descriptive argv[0], usually by means of the exec system call.
The main() function is special; normally every C and C++ program must define it exactly once.
If declared, main() must be declared as if it has external linkage; it cannot be declared static or inline.
In C++, main() must be in the global namespace (i.e. ::main), cannot be overloaded, and cannot be a member function, although the name is not otherwise reserved, and may be used for member functions, classes, enumerations, or non-member functions in other namespaces. In C++ (unlike C) main() cannot be called recursively and cannot have its address taken.


=== C# ===
When executing a program written in C#, the CLR searches for a static method marked with the .entrypoint IL directive, which takes either no arguments, or a single argument of type string[], and has a return type of void or int, and executes it.

Command-line arguments are passed in args, similar to how it is done in Java. For versions of Main() returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.
Since C#7.1 there are four more possible signatures of the entry point, which allow asynchronous execution in the Main() Method.

The Task and Task<int> types are the asynchronous equivalents of void and int. async is required to allow the use of asynchrony (the await keyword) inside the method.


=== Clean ===
Clean is a functional programming language based on graph rewriting. The initial node is named Start and is of type *World -> *World if it changes the world or some fixed type if the program only prints the result after reducing Start.

Or even simpler

One tells the compiler which option to use to generate the executable file.


=== Common Lisp ===
ANSI Common Lisp does not define a main function; instead, the code is read and evaluated from top to bottom in a source file. However, the following code will emulate a main function.


=== D ===
In D, the function prototype of the main function looks like one of the following:

Command-line arguments are passed in args, similar to how it is done in C# or Java. For versions of main() returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.


=== Dart ===
Dart is a general-purpose programming language that is often used for building web and mobile applications. Like many other programming languages, Dart has an entry point that serves as the starting point for a Dart program. The entry point is the first function that is executed when a program runs. In Dart, the entry point is typically a function named main . When a Dart program is run, the Dart runtime looks for a function named main and executes it. Any Dart code that is intended to be executed when the program starts should be included in the main function. Here is an example of a simple main function in Dart:

In this example, the main function simply prints the text Hello, world! to the console when the program is run. This code will be executed automatically when the Dart program is run.
It is important to note that while the main function is the default entry point for a Dart program, it is possible to specify a different entry point if needed. This can be done using the @pragma(""vm:entry-point"") annotation in Dart. However, in most cases, the main function is the entry point that should be used for Dart programs.


=== FORTRAN ===
FORTRAN does not have a main subroutine or function. Instead a PROGRAM statement as the first line can be used to specify that a program unit is a main program, as shown below. The PROGRAM statement cannot be used for recursive calls.

Some versions of Fortran, such as those on the IBM System/360 and successor mainframes, do not support the PROGRAM statement. Many compilers from other software manufacturers will allow a fortran program to be compiled without a PROGRAM statement. In these cases, whatever module that has any non-comment statement where no SUBROUTINE, FUNCTION or BLOCK DATA statement occurs, is considered to be the Main program.


=== GNAT ===
Using GNAT, the programmer is not required to write a function named main; a source file containing a single subprogram can be compiled to an executable. The binder will however create a package ada_main, which will contain and export a C-style main function.


=== Go ===
In Go programming language, program execution starts with the main function of the package main

There is no way to access arguments or a return code outside of the standard library in Go. These can be accessed via os.Args and os.Exit respectively, both of which are included in the ""os"" package.


=== Haskell ===
A Haskell program must contain a name main bound to a value of type IO t, for some type t; which is usually IO (). IO is a monad, which organizes side-effects in terms of purely functional code. The main value represents the side-effects-ful computation done by the program. The result of the computation represented by main is discarded; that is why main usually has type IO (), which indicates that the type of the result of the computation is (), the unit type, which contains no information.

Command line arguments are not given to main; they must be fetched using another IO action, such as System.Environment.getArgs.


=== Java ===
Java programs start executing at the main method of a class, which has one of the following method headings:

Command-line arguments are passed in args. As in C and C++, the name ""main()"" is special. Java's main methods do not return a value directly, but one can be passed by using the System.exit() method.
Unlike C, the name of the program is not included in args, because it is the name of the class that contains the main method, so it is already known. Also unlike C, the number of arguments need not be included, since arrays in Java have a field that keeps track of how many elements there are.
The main function must be included within a class. This is because in Java everything has to be contained within a class. For instance, a hello world program in Java may look like:

To run this program, one must call java HelloWorld in the directory where the compiled class file HelloWorld.class) exists. Alternatively, executable JAR files use a manifest file to specify the entry point in a manner that is filesystem-independent from the user's perspective.


=== LOGO ===
In FMSLogo, the procedures when loaded do not execute. To make them execute, it is necessary to use this code:

to procname
 ...                 ; Startup commands (such as print [Welcome])
end

make ""startup [procname]

The variable startup is used for the startup list of actions, but the convention is that this calls a procedure that runs the actions. That procedure may be of any name.


=== OCaml ===
OCaml has no main function. Programs are evaluated from top to bottom.
Command-line arguments are available in an array named Sys.argv and the exit status is 0 by default.
Example:


=== Pascal ===
In Pascal, the main procedure is the only unnamed block in the program. Because Pascal programs define procedures and functions in a more rigorous bottom-up order than C, C++ or Java programs, the main procedure is usually the last block in the program. Pascal does not have a special meaning for the name ""main"" or any similar name.

Command-line arguments are counted in ParamCount and accessible as strings by ParamStr(n), with n between 0 and ParamCount.
Versions of Pascal that support units or modules may also contain an unnamed block in each, which is used to initialize the module. These blocks are executed before the main program entry point is called.


=== Perl ===
In Perl, there is no main function. Statements are executed from top to bottom, although statements in a BEGIN block are executed before normal statements.
Command-line arguments are available in the special array @ARGV. Unlike C, @ARGV does not contain the name of the program, which is $0.


=== PHP ===
PHP does not have a ""main"" function. Starting from the first line of a PHP script, any code not encapsulated by a function header is executed as soon as it is seen.


=== Pike ===
In Pike syntax is similar to that of C and C++.  The execution begins at main.  The ""argc"" variable keeps the number of arguments passed to the program.  The ""argv"" variable holds the value associated with the arguments passed to the program.
Example:


=== Python ===
Python programs are evaluated top-to-bottom, as is usual in scripting languages: the entry point is the start of the source code. Since definitions must precede use, programs are typically structured with definitions at the top and the code to execute at the bottom (unindented), similar to code for a one-pass compiler, such as in Pascal.
Alternatively, a program can be structured with an explicit main function containing the code to be executed when a program is executed directly, but which can also be invoked by importing the program as a module and calling the function. This can be done by the following idiom, which relies on the internal variable __name__ being set to __main__ when a program is executed, but not when it is imported as a module (in which case it is instead set to the module name); there are many variants of this structure:

In this idiom, the call to the named entry point main is explicit, and the interaction with the operating system (receiving the arguments, calling system exit) are done explicitly by library calls, which are ultimately handled by the Python runtime. This contrasts with C, where these are done implicitly by the runtime, based on convention.


=== QB64 ===
The QB64 language has no main function, the code that is not within a function, or subroutine is executed first, from top to bottom:

Command line arguments (if any) can be read using the COMMAND$ function:


=== Ruby ===
In Ruby, there is no distinct main function. Instead, code written outside of any class .. end or module .. end scope is executed in the context of a special ""main"" object. This object can be accessed using self:

It has the following properties:

Methods defined outside of a class or module scope are defined as private methods of the ""main"" object. Since the class of ""main"" is Object, such methods become private methods of almost every object:

The number and values of command-line arguments can be determined using the ARGV constant array:

The first element of ARGV, ARGV[0], contains the first command-line argument, not the name of program executed, as in C. The name of program is available using $0 or $PROGRAM_NAME.
Similar to Python, one could use:

to execute some code only if its file was specified in the ruby invocation.


=== Rust ===
In Rust, the entry point of a program is a function named main. Typically, this function is situated in a file called main.rs or lib.rs.

Additionally, as of Rust 1.26.0, the main function may return a Result:


=== Swift ===
When run in an Xcode Playground, Swift behaves like a scripting language, executing statements from top to bottom; top-level code is allowed.Cocoa- and Cocoa Touch-based applications written in Swift are usually initialized with the @NSApplicationMain and @UIApplicationMain attributes, respectively. Those attributes are equivalent in their purpose to the main.m file in Objective-C projects: they implicitly declare the main function that calls UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:) which creates an instance of UIApplication.
The following code is the default way to initialize a Cocoa Touch-based iOS app and declare its application delegate.


=== Visual Basic ===
In Visual Basic, when a project contains no forms, the startup object may be the Main() procedure. The Command$ function can be optionally used to access the argument portion of the command line used to launch the program:


=== Xojo ===
In Xojo, there are two different project types, each with a different main entry point. Desktop (GUI) applications start with the App.Open event of the project's Application object. Console applications start with the App.Run event of the project's ConsoleApplication object. In both instances, the main function is automatically generated, and cannot be removed from the project.

Annual percentage rate,"The term annual percentage rate (APR), also called nominal APR, and the term effective APR, means the interest rate for a whole year, rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, or credit card. This rate is useful when buying a car, a house, or any other expensive possession. Since few people are able to afford to pay the full price, many sellers choose to divide the price into monthly payments and a down payment. This makes things easier to buy. Once the buyer pays the down payment, he or she enters into an agreement to pay the remaining months. But since the buyer has not paid the entire amount yet, the seller is essentially lending part of the purchase to the buyer. This is where interest rates come in. The seller charges the monthly payments with a part or a percentage of the remaining amount. This amount gets added onto the monthly payment. Some companies force the buyer to pay the interest first, and the remaining amount pays the original loaned amount, called the principal.

Small Dark Spot,"The Small Dark Spot, sometimes also called Dark Spot 2 or The Wizard's Eye, was a southern cyclonic storm on the planet Neptune. It was the second strongest storm on the planet in 1989, when Voyager 2 flew by the planet. When first discovered, it was  a dark cyclonic storm.  As Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core of cloud activity developed. It disappeared in 1994.

Money,"Money, also sometimes called currency, can be defined as anything that people use go and to buy goods and services. Money is what many people receive for selling their own things or services.
There are lots of different kinds of money in the world. Most countries have their own kind of money, such as the United States dollar or the British pound.


== History ==
The idea of bartering things is very old. A long time ago, people did not buy or sell with money. Instead, they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed. One person who owned many cows could trade with another person who had a lot of wheat. Each would trade a little of what he had with the other. This would support the people on his farm. Other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable. This gave rise to trade items such as jewelry and spices.

 
When people changed from trading in things like, for example, cows and wheat to using money instead, they needed things that would last a long time. They must still have a known value, and could be carried around. The first country in the world to make metal coins was called Lydia. These first appeared during the 7th century BC, in the western part of what is now Turkey. The Lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion. This idea soon spread to Greece, the rest of the Mediterranean, and the rest of the world. Coins were all made to the same size and shape. In some parts of the world, different things have been used as money, like clam shells or blocks of salt.
Besides being easier to carry than cows, using money had many other advantages. Money is easier to divide than many trade goods. If someone own cows, and wants to trade for only ""half a cow's worth"" of wheat, he probably does not want to cut his cow in half. But if he sells his cow for money, and buys wheat with money, he can get exactly the amount he wants.
Cows die, and wheat rots. But money lasts longer than most trade goods. If someone sells a cow for money, he can save that money away until he needs it. He can always leave it to his children when he dies. It can last a very long time, and he can use it at any time.
Not every cow is as good as another cow. Some cows are sick and old, and others are healthy and young. Some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale. So if a person trades cows for wheat, he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth. However, money is standard. That means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar. It is easier to add up and count money, than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat.
Later, after coins had been used for hundreds of years, paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin, much like an ""I.O.U."" note. The first true paper money was used in China in the 10th century AD. Paper money was also printed in Sweden between 1660 and 1664. Both times, it did not work well, and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes. Massachusetts Bay Colony printed paper money in the 1690s. This time, the use became more common.
Today, most of what people think of as money is not even things you can hold. It is numbers in bank accounts, saved in computer memories. Many people still feel more comfortable using coins and paper, and do not totally trust using electronic money on a computer memory.


== Kinds ==
 
Many types of money have been used at different times in history. These are:

Cowry shells
Commodity money
Convertible paper money
Inconvertible money
Bank deposits
Electronic money
Commodity money can be used for other purposes besides serving as a medium of exchange. We say it possesses intrinsic value, because it is useful or valuable by itself. Some examples of commodity money are cattle, silk, gold and silver. Convertible paper money is money that is convertible into gold and silver. Gold and Silver certificates are convertible paper money as they can be fully convertible into gold and silver.
Inconvertible money is money that cannot be converted into gold and silver. Notes and coins are inconvertible money. They are inconvertible and are declared by the government money. Such fiat money is a country's legal tender. Today, notes and coins are the currencies used in bank deposits.
Types of bank deposits:

Demand deposits
Savings deposits
Time deposits
Negotiable certificate

Application programming interface,"An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions, procedures, methods or classes used by computer programs to request services from the operating system, software libraries or any other service providers running on the computer. A computer programmer uses the API to make
application programs.
An API works by communicating with and exchanging data with other systems, acting as a messenger between the user and the system to retrieve the necessary data the user is requesting from the system. 
Main types of web APIs:

Open APIs - available to the public; they can be accessed by any external users.
Partner APIs - available to strategic business partners; they are exposed to a public API developer portal.
Internal APIs - available to a company's internal development teams; they are exposed to a private API developer portal.
Composite APIs - are a sequence of tasks bundled into a single API call.
Types of API include web services API like the Twitter API, which allows programs to use the API to receive updates on tweets.

Ethereum,"Ethereum is a system on the Internet where people can make deals. Ether is type of money which uses the Ethereum system to make sure that every person gets the right amount in every deal.
Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Many people donated money to support the development of the system in what was one of the first initial coin offerings. The system came online on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins.
In 2016, Ethereum split into two separate versions: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
Ethereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition to proof of stake and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding.


== Overview ==
Ether is a type of money that is decentralized, which means that there's no company, bank or government that oversees it. Instead, it uses the Ethereum network of computers spread around the world, which keep track of every payment of ether. As in other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum keeps track of payments by using a blockchain, which is a growing registry of every payment. This blockchain is open for everyone to read, and it is spread across the network so that everyone can check what payments have been made. This also protects against hacking or theft of money from the system, because if the blockchain was to be altered in some computers then it would be noticed that it is not identical with the others.
Ether is a form of cryptocurrency, which means that it is decentralized, and also means that people can use it for payments without revealing who they are. Instead, people can use the Ethereum system by addresses (also called keys) which they can keep secret from others. The Ether coin can be transferred between accounts and used as a payment mechanism. The Ether coin is mined and used as compensation to miners for verifying transactions.
After bitcoin, digital currency ether is the second most widespread cryptocurrency. However, Ethereum – the blockchain platform that supports ether transactions – has a few technological advantages over the market leader. Whereas practically the only use for bitcoin is in monetary transactions, Ethereum offers the additional option of linking the transactions to contractual conditions in what are known as smart contracts. These are small computer programs that are executed when the relevant monetary transaction has been concluded or, conversely, that trigger a monetary transaction or data delivery once they have been executed.


== History ==
Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine in late 2013.
Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014. During the conference, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Iorio (who financed the project) rented a house in Miami with Buterin to develop a fuller sense of what Ethereum might become.
In January 2018, Ethereum was the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin. As of 2021, it maintained that relative position.
In 2019, Ethereum Foundation employee Virgil Griffith was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea.
On 27 August 2021, the blockchain experienced a brief fork that was the result of clients running different incompatible software versions.
Ethereum's founding story and team are featured in the 2021 book The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze. The Cryptopians focuses on the infamous 2016 DAO hack on Ethereum. During this hack, over 3.6 million ether–about 15% of all ether in the world at the time–was stolen. Author Laura Shin writes about exciting and sometimes bad situations with the project's founding and the huge cryptocurrency rise of 2017.

Firewood,"Firewood is any wooden material that is gathered and used for fuel. It is a renewable resource. Generally, firewood is not highly processed and is in some sort of log or branch form. Firewood has been essential to human civilization for thousands of years. It's been used for heating, cooking, lighting, and even in industries.


== History ==
Firewood has been a crucial resource since ancient times, when humans first harnessed fire's benefits. It provided warmth, safety, and a way to cook meals. Early civilizations heavily relied on firewood, often sourcing it from forests. Ancient cultures like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans used firewood extensively for heating, cooking, and industrial needs.
Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, firewood remained vital. It fueled fires in castles, monasteries, and households. Demand increased, leading communities to organize wood supplies, sometimes through cottage industries where locals gathered and sold firewood.

Medical ethics,"Medical ethics is the set of ethical rules that medical doctors follow. These ethics guide doctors as to how they should treat patients.
The earliest set of ethical ideas in medicine was the Hippocratic oath (an oath is an important promise). It was supposed to be written by Hippocrates.


== Principles ==
There are 6 major principles (important ideas):

Beneficences - a doctor must do things that are good for the patient (the doctor is giving medical care to.)
Non-maleficence – a doctor must not try to hurt his patients.
Autonomy - the patient can say he does not want to be treated
Justice – talks about what is fair in giving people medicines and care. It talks about who gets what treatments.
Dignity - the patient (and the doctor) have the right to dignity (respect for someone as a person)
Truthfulness (being honest) – the doctor must tell the patient the truth


== Medical ethics questions ==
Here are some kinds of medical ethics questions:

If there is not enough of a medicine to treat every person who has a disease who should get the medicine?
If a baby has a disease that will kill him very soon, what should a doctor do if the baby's mother says she does not want the baby to be helped?
A patient has an injury that cannot be helped and that will kill them in a few minutes. The patient asks a doctor “am I going to die?” What should the doctor say?
If a man has stage four cancer but only wants hollistic medicine, should you treat him with chemotherapy anyway?

Pipe (material),"A pipe is a tube or hollow cylinder for the transport of fluid. The terms 'pipe' and 'tube' can be used for the same objects. 'Pipe' is generally specified by the internal diameter (ID) whereas 'tube' is usually defined by the outside diameter (OD) but may be specified by any combination of dimensions (OD, ID, wall thickness). 'Tube' is often made to custom sizes and may often have more specific sizes and tolerances than pipe. The terms 'tube' and 'tubing' are more widely used in the US and 'pipe' elsewhere in the world.
Both ""pipe"" and ""tube"" imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a 'hose' is usually portable and flexible.


== Uses ==
Domestic water systems
Pipeline containing high pressure gas or fluid
Scaffolding
Structural steel
As components in mechanical systems such as:
Rollers in conveyor belts
Compactors (E.g.: steam rollers)
Bearing casing
Casing for concrete pilings used in construction projects
High temperature or pressure manufacturing processes
The petroleum industry:
Oil well casing
Oil refinery equipment
The construction of high pressure storage vessels


== Pipe cutter ==
Pipe cutters for thin plastic pipes are like scissors. For cutting pipes of large diameter, with thicker walls and made of harder materials, pipe cutters are used, which are a clamp with a cutting wheel, pressure rollers and a lever.

Machine translation,"Machine translation, sometimes referred to by the acronym MT, is part of computational linguistics. It is the use of computer software to translate text or speech from one natural language to another. 
At its basic level, MT changes words words in one natural language for words in another. That is literal translation.
Present machine translation software adapts the translation to the subject. For example, weather reports improve output by limiting the substitutions. This technique is very effective in domains where specialised formal language is used. It follows then that machine translation of government and legal documents more often produces usable output than conversation or less standardised text.


== Quotes ==
In the words of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT):


== History ==
The origins of machine translation can be traced back to the work of Al-Kindi, a ninth-century Arabic cryptographer. He developed techniques for systemic language translation. He was aware of cryptanalysis, frequency analysis, probability and statistics, which are all used in modern machine translation. 
An idea related to machine translation appeared in the 17th century. In 1629, René Descartes proposed a universal language, where equivalent ideas shared a symbol.
The idea of using digital computers for translation of natural languages was proposed in 1947 by England's A.D. Booth and Warren Weaver at Rockefeller Foundation in the same year. ""The memorandum written by Warren Weaver in 1949 is perhaps the single most influential publication in the earliest days of machine translation"". 
Others followed. One example was reading and composing Braille texts by computer.

Steam (service),"Steam is an internet-based digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and social networking program developed and distributed by Valve Corporation. Steam has its own store where the user can purchase video games and other software. It is available for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux. Steam also has an application with fewer functions for smartphones which is available for Android and iOS. Steam can also be used as a communication software, meaning that you can talk with people if they are your friends on Steam.


== Popularity ==
The Steam platform is considered to be one of the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, and was estimated by Screen Digest to have 75% of the market space in October 2013. In 2015, users purchasing titles through Steam or through Steam keys from third-party vendors totaling around $3.5 billion representing 15% of the global PC game sales for the year, based on estimations made by the tracking website Steam Spy. By the end of 2015, the service had over 125 million registered accounts, with 12.5 million concurrent users. The success of the Steam platform has led to the development of a line of Steam Machine micro-console, as well as SteamOS, an in-house fork of the Debian operating system. As of February 2015, Steam has over 125 million users.

Dorsal pancreatic agenesis,"Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is a congenital anomaly characterised by the absence of the duct of Santorini, tail and body of the pancreas. It is regarded as asymptomatic and the most common clinical manifestation is non-specific abdominal pain. While the cause is unclear, its mechanism is thought to be impaired dorsal buds or mutation of genes that regulate organogenesis during embryogenesis.
Early diagnostic methods are laparotomy and autopsy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and computed tomography scan (CT scan) are combined for diagnosis of this agenesis in recent years. No specific medications are needed for relieving symptoms, but pancreatic enzymes capsule and insulin are prescribed.
Scholars have studied several transcription factors and proteins that can manipulate pancreatic growth and related to dorsal pancreatic agenesis. This malformation is associated with other pancreatic disorders including pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors. Also, patients with this dysgenesis are usually accompanied with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction such as diabetes mellitus.
The prevalence and geographical pattern are unknown. First reported in 1911 by Heiberg in an autopsy.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The agenesis of the dorsal pancreas is asymptomatic in most cases due to the functional reserves of exocrine and endocrine pancreas. Thereby it is often diagnosed incidentally by autopsy, surgery, endoscopy, or imaging technologies during evaluation of other diseases. Some common indicators reported by patients include abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. Abdominal pain could be associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, diabetic autonomic neuropathy; and weight loss can also be due to diabetes mellitus in some patients.
The localisation of abdominal pain is at epigastrium and aggregates after meals. The two possible reasons for abdominal pain include the underdevelopment of the papillary muscle of the sphincter of Oddi or the autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus. Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is associated with diabetes mellitus because the β cells in the islets of Langerhans are present in the pancreatic body and tail, which are both absent in agenesis of the dorsal pancreas. Patients with dorsal pancreatic agenesis may result in a defect in the metabolism of hepatic glycogen, which may be related to the reduced β cell mass.


=== Associated conditions ===


==== Pancreatitis ====
Pancreatitis is a common disorder associated with dorsal pancreatic agenesis. However, it is unclear whether the high occurrence of pancreatitis is due to repetitive imaging procedures or whether it is a comorbidity of agenesis.


==== Diabetes mellitus ====
Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disease that is due to insufficient amount of insulin produced by the pancreas, and it is another common disease linked with dorsal pancreatic agenesis. Insulin is produced by the β cells of the islet of Langerhans in the dorsal pancreas. In patients with agenesis of the dorsal pancreas, the amount of β cells are reduced thus leading to a high possibility of causing diabetes mellitus.


==== Pancreatic tumors ====
Tumors can also be associated with dorsal pancreatic agenesis. Reported pancreatic tumors include solid papillary, solid pseudopapillary tumors, adenocarcinomas, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN).


==== Organ malfunction ====
Organ malfunction is also associated with dorsal pancreatic agenesis. Disorders such as polycystic kidney disease, Kartagener syndrome, multiple splenic deformities, congenital choledochal cysts, and biliary atresia have been reported.


== Cause ==
There is no suggested cause for the dorsal pancreatic agenesis, however there are several hypotheses for the underlying mechanism. As the dorsal pancreatic bud is the ancestor for the majority of pancreas, one possible explanation to this rare anomaly is the dorsal mesentery ischemia which induces the dysgenesis of pancreas. In spite of the unknown molecular mechanism, some scholars have speculated the mode of inheritance of this agenesis, which is autosomal-dominant or X-linked disease.


=== Genetics ===
Scientists have demonstrated a wide spectrum of genes that can manipulate and regulate the embryonic pancreatic development by in vivo animal study. The formation of dorsal and ventral buds is reliant on the interaction of transcription factors, for instance the Pax4, Pax6 and Ptf1a. By expressing sonic hedgehog (Shh) or Indian hedgehog (Ihh), the growth of both dorsal and ventral buds from the foregut endoderm is repressed to a large extent, inhibition of Shh or Ihh signaling pathway favor the pancreatic development. The Homeodomain protein HB9 (Hlxb9) is critical for the formation of the dorsal bud, however it is not significant to the ventral bud. Another homeodomain protein, PDX1 (also known as Ipf-1 insulin promoter factor 1) is the initiator of buds expression, genetic mutation on gene Ipf-1 can lead to pancreatic agenesis. Also, both heterozygous and homozygous variant of PDX1 can cause dysgenesis of pancreas and neonatal diabetes.
CDH2 (CD352) gene encoded Neural-cadherin (N-cadherin) is identified to have a active role in recruiting dorsal pancreatic mesenchyme for pancreatic morphogenesis, depletion of N-cadherin in mice can lead to the apoptosis of dorsal pancreatic mesenchyme cells. Moreover, research suggests that retinoid acid is significant for the development of pancreas as the deficiency of retinoid acid can induce dorsal pancreatic agenesis in mice.


== Embryonic development of pancreas ==
The pancreas is responsible for secreting various enzymes for most digestion. It is a retroperitoneal organ posterior to the great curvature of the stomach. Its anterior surface is covered by the parietal peritoneum while the posterior surface contacts the aorta as well as other viscera on the left posterior body wall. Its 15 cm entity is divided into three parts, a globular head attached to the right side of duodenum, a long body, and a blunt head.
In embryonic development, the pancreas is formed by the convergence of the two pancreatic buds (dorsal and ventral) during the sixth and seventh week of gestation, but the development of these two buds is initiated at about week 4. During the gestation phase which takes place at week 4, the dorsal bud develops from the dorsal mesentery, and form the body and tail of the pancreas. Meanwhile, the ventral bud arises inferior to form the head of the pancreas. Two weeks later, the ventral bud will rotate dorsally and fuse with the dorsal bud to form the pancreas. The fusion of the duct happened at the same time, to form the duct of Wirsung and the duct of Santorini.  Any deviation from the normal pancreatic embryogenesis process can potentially leads to congenital malformation of the pancreas. Among all anomalies, Pancreatic Divisum is the most prevalent one, followed by Pancreatic Heterotopia. In comparison, a complete agenesis of dorsal pancreas is rare and often associated with infant mortality.
The agenesis of dorsal pancreas can be classified into two classes based on the morphological features: complete and partial agenesis. For the former one, the accessory pancreatic duct (also known as duct of Santorini) as well as the body and tail of the pancreas are missing. For partial agenesis, the tail of the pancreas is still present.


== Diagnosis ==

Dorsal pancreatic agenesis with advancement in modern day technology,  is currently diagnosed with the following imaging technologies, and sometimes a combination of these methods.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). An invasive, operator-dependent gold standard for diagnosis. It presents the pancreatic duct; the absence or presence of the dorsal ductal system and the minor papilla can be used to indicate dorsal pancreatic agenesis.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). A non-invasive, accurate type of MRI to depict the major and accessory pancreatic ducts.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A non-invasive, non-radiation exposed method that can be used to identify the morphological structure of the pancreas.
Computed Tomography (CT). A non-invasive method to diagnose dorsal pancreatic agenesis by an absence of pancreatic tissue ventral to the splenic vein.
Stomach/intestine sign. Can be used to distinguish dorsal pancreatic agenesis from distal pancreatic lipomatosis.
Transabdominal Ultrasound (US). The diagnostic ability depends on pancreatic bowel gas or the patient's body habitus.
Agenesis of dorsal pancreas has to be differentiated with pancreatic fat infiltration, chronic pancreatitis and atrophy of pancreatic body and tail. The absence of pancreatic body and tail is the usual manifestation of dorsal pancreatic agenesis, the density and morphological features of the pancreatic head should be either normal or slightly enlarged due to compensation of the absent body and tail.
Stomach/intestine sign can combine with CT for better diagnosis. Since dorsal pancreatic agenesis can be at times complicated with pancreatic tumors, CT is a visualisation tool that can be used to exclude both pancreatic tumors and abdominal tumors, which allows for improved observation.


== Management ==
Vast majority of dorsal pancreatic agenesis cases are diagnosed incidentally and asymptomatic, hence there is no special medication for dorsal pancreatic agenesis.


=== Medication ===
1. Pancreatic enteric-coated capsules. A proposed study suggested dorsal pancreatic agenesis patients show Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) related symptoms. Oral administration of pancreatic enzymes, including lipase, protease and amylase is useful for relieving EPI related symptoms. In addition, pay attention to drugs that may interact with pancreatic enzymes such as Acarbose and Miglitol.
2. Exogenous insulin. Patients with dorsal pancreatic agenesis have lost the tail of pancreas which contain the Islet of Langerhan for insulin production. Therefore, exogenous insulin can be used to treat the accompanied Diabetes Mellitus.


== History ==
Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is an extremely rare disease, there are only about 100 cases reported so far and no association discovered between a specific geographical location and disease prevalence. First reported in 1911 by Heiberg in an autopsy. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and associated with pulmonary tuberculosis, the observed morphology of pancreatic head was described as ""large and thick"". Two years later, the second case was reported by Ghon and Roman (1913).

Moon landing,"A Moon landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. It is a follow up to Project Mercury. This includes both crewed and uncrewed (robotic) missions. The first man-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.
The United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969. There have been six missions with people onboard that landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. There were also numerous landings without people onboard, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.
To date, the United States is the only country to have successfully landed humans on the Moon. The last mission was in December, 1972, and the last human to walk on the Moon was Gene Cernan.

Wild man,"A wild man of the woods, also known as a wild man of the jungle, wild man of the forest, woodwose, wodewose or wereape or simply a wild man, is a legendary creature that painters and artists in medieval Europe would put in their artwork. It was always shown as man covered with hair. The image of a wild man were used for coats-of-arms, especially in Germany. Renaissance engravers in Germany and Italy added wild men, wild women and wild families to art (for example, Albrecht Dürer or Holbein the Younger).

Driftwood,"Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto the shore of a sea, river, or lake by winds, tides, waves or man.
In some waterfront areas, driftwood is a major nuisance. However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean. Gribbles, shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes.
Driftwood can be:

a tree or part of a tree that is in a large body of water because of strong winds or flooding
buildings and their contents that are in the sea because of floods, storms and tsunamis
wooden objects placed into the water from shore
remains of wooden ships and boats
lost cargo


== In history ==
According to Norse mythology, the first humans, Ask and Embla, were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an ash and an elm, by the god Odin and his brothers, Ve and Vili. 
Driftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree-line until they came into regular contact with European traders. 
Many people use driftwood as parts of decorative furniture or other art forms, and it is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks.",0
Resin canal,"Resin canals or resin ducts are elongated, tube-shaped intercellular spaces surrounded by epithelial cells which secrete resin into the canal. These canals are orientated longitudinally and radially in between fusiform rays. They are usually found in late wood: denser wood grown later in the season. Resin is antiseptic and aromatic and prevents the development of fungi and deters insects.


== Types ==
Normal resin canals exist naturally in the wood of the genera Picea, Larix, Pinus, Pseudotsuga and Shorea.
Traumatic resin canals may be formed in wounded trees that don't have normal resin canals. Wounding occurs from either fire, freezing or mechanical damage. These canals are irregularly shaped compared to normal resin canals.


== Characteristics ==
Resin canal characteristics (such as number, size and density) in pine species can determine its resistance to pests. In one study, biologists were able to categorize 84% of lodgepole pine, and 92% of limber pines, as being either susceptible or resistant to bark beetles based only on their resin canals and growth rate over 20 years. In another study, scientists found ponderosa pine trees that survived drought and bark beetle attacks had resin ducts that were >10% larger in diameter, >25% denser (resin canals per mm2), and composed >50% more area of per ring.

Dust devil,"Dust devils are twirling masses of air that form in the desert and send sand spinning. The height of a dust devil can range from a few meters tall to more than 1,000 meters (3,281 ft) tall. They are usually harmless, but occasionally they can cause some damage to both people and property.


== Formation ==
A dust devil forms when hot air near the ground rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler, low-pressure air above it. If conditions are just right, then the air may begin to rotate. As the air rapidly rises, the hot air is stretched vertically and because of angular momentum, the spinning gets much more intense. Because the hot air cools when it rises, it eventually goes down to the base and expands horizontally, while more hot air shoots up the column to replace the lost air. The air that is displaced falls to the ground around the dust devil, creating a balancing force. Thus, a dust devil is formed.
Certain conditions help the formation of dust devils: 
1. Flat barren, desert terrain: Flat terrain and hot conditions help the hot air ""fuel"" being always available. The dust and sand helps the dust devil be seen.

2. Clear skies or lightly cloudy conditions: The surface needs a lot of solar energy to heat the air.

3. Light or no wind, and cool temperature in the atmosphere: Without a cool atmosphere and hot surface, the dust devil with never form. Wind will not keep the dust devil stable.
A dust devil ""dies"" when it eventually sucks in cool air from the surface. Cool air destroys the dust devil because it quickly discourages the rising of air through the column. This usually happens when the dust devil becomes weak, or moves across a new terrain were the surface temperatures are cooler.
Similarly, when hot air rises rapidly in water bodies and if conditions are just right they are known as water sprout.


== Martian dust devils ==

Dust devils occur on the planet of Mars as well. They can be ten times higher than ones on Earth, and fifty times as wide. They can pose a threat to technology placed on Mars.
However, not all dust devils are damaging. Mission members keeping an eye on the Mars Spirit rover reported that on March 12, 2005, a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the solar panels of that robot. Power levels dramatically increased, and much more scientific work was able to be done.

Heli hiking,"Heli hiking is a recreational activity in which a helicopter is used to access remote areas of the back country for hiking. These locations are typically inaccessible through other forms of transportation. Along with heli skiing, heli hiking is one of the most popular forms of heli tourism. It falls within the broad category of amateur adventure or activity-based tourism. It is a seasonal commercial backcountry industry, which also includes mountaineering and kayaking.
Heli hiking is a form of mountain recreation in the mountainous regions of New Zealand and the Bugaboos in Canada. It is a form of glacier tourism in locations including Glacier Bay National Park, Westland Tai Poutini National Park, and Ilulissat Icefjord.


== History ==
The first heli hiking tour took place in the summer of 1978 at the Cariboo Lodge, operated by Canadian Mountain Holidays. It was introduced as and continues to be the summer counterpart to heli skiing.


== Marketing ==
Heli hiking has been marketed toward women. It is popular among young female tourists in New Zealand.
The activity is advertised as a luxury tourist attraction.


== Environmental impact and regulation ==
Due to the disturbances caused by helicopter overflights, heli hiking is considered by authorities to be a possible cause of the decline of the mountain goat population in southeastern British Columbia and is opposed by the East Kootenay Environmental Society. It has also impacted British Columbia's Graham caribou population through displacement and interruption of migratory cycles.
In the North Cascades, heli hiking has been discouraged by the United States Forest Service. However, there is still minimal regulation of heli hiking and other mountain recreation activities for environmental protection.

Software release life cycle,"A software release life cycle is the different stages of making a computer program, giving it out to other people, and making sure the computer program works right after it is released.
Stages can either be officially announced and regulated by developers, or sometimes the term is used to describe the state of the product.


== Stages of development (making the computer program) ==


=== Pre-alpha ===
Pre-alpha is the first stage of making a computer program. People making the computer program think up what the computer program should have in it, and start to actually create the computer program itself. Also, programs that have not yet entered the alpha or beta stage, but passed the development stage, are called so.


=== Alpha ===
Alpha software is a computer program that can do most of what the programmers (people who make the software) want it to do, but it has lots of problems. Only the things that the programmers really want the software to do has been made without many problems.


=== Beta ===
A computer program goes into beta when programmers have made the software do everything it needs to do, but there may still be problems. The people who make the software then give it out to other people, so they can test whether the software works properly. They may still find problems that they did not find in alpha. Some programs, even very stable, exist only as beta versions. The most frequent reason is that the developer continues to release new features which are not usually well tested. In this way responsible developers inform users about the increased risk of problems, but not to avoid responsibility. Even a final version of every program or operating system contains a disclaimer that says that a developer is not responsible for any loss or damage caused to a user.
It is also known as betaware.


=== RC ===
RC (release candidate) is a candidate stage for becoming stable. The software of this stage has passed almost full testing and the main errors have been corrected. But at the same time, there are some bugs that could not be found during testing.
It is also called as ""going silver"".


=== RTM ===
RTM (release to manufacturing) is a publication of a product which is ready for replication. This is a stable version of the program that has gone through all stages of development. The main errors were fixed, but there is a possibility of new mistakes.


=== GA ===
GA (general availability) is a public version of the software and people can buy it. The time between RTM and GA can be from a week to a month. At this stage, the software ""went into operation"".

Engraved gem,"An engraved gem, frequently referred to as an intaglio, is a small and usually semi-precious gemstone that has been carved, in the Western tradition normally with images or inscriptions only on one face. The engraving of gemstones was a major luxury art form in the ancient world, and an important one in some later periods.
Strictly speaking, engraving means carving in intaglio (with the design cut into the flat background of the stone), but relief carvings (with the design projecting out of the background as in nearly all cameos) are also covered by the term. This article uses cameo in its strict sense, to denote a carving exploiting layers of differently coloured stone. The activity is also called gem carving and the artists gem-cutters. References to antique gems and intaglios in a jewellery context will almost always mean carved gems; when referring to monumental sculpture, the term counter-relief, meaning the same as intaglio, is more likely to be used. Vessels like the Cup of the Ptolemies and heads or figures carved in the round are also known as hardstone carvings.
Glyptics or glyptic art covers the field of small carved stones, including cylinder seals and inscriptions, especially in an archaeological context. Though they were keenly collected in antiquity, most carved gems originally functioned as seals, often mounted in a ring; intaglio designs register most clearly when viewed by the recipient of a letter as an impression in hardened wax. A finely carved seal was practical, as it made forgery more difficult – the distinctive personal signature did not really exist in antiquity.


== Technique ==
Gems  were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a lathe. Emery has been mined for abrasive powder on Naxos since antiquity. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by gem cutters in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity – since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.


== History ==

The technique has an ancient tradition in the Near East, and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the Indus Valley civilization. The cylinder seal, whose design appears only when it is rolled over damp clay, from which the flat ring type developed, was the usual form in Mesopotamia, Assyria and other cultures, and spread to the Aegean and Minoan world, including parts of Greece and Cyprus. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone, and gold rings were a related development in Minoan seals, which are often very fine.  The Greek tradition emerged in Ancient Greek art under Minoan influence on mainland Helladic culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the Hellenistic period. Pre-Hellenic Ancient Egyptian seals tend to have inscriptions in hieroglyphs rather than images. The biblical Book of Exodus describes the form of the hoshen, a ceremonial breastplate worn by the high priest, bearing twelve gems engraved with the names of the Twelve tribes of Israel.
Round or oval Greek gems (along with similar objects in bone and ivory) are found from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, usually with animals in energetic geometric poses, often with a border marked by dots or a rim. Early examples are mostly in softer stones. Gems of the 6th century are more often oval, with a scarab back (in the past this type was called a ""scarabaeus""), and human or divine figures as well as animals; the scarab form was apparently adopted from Phoenicia. The forms are sophisticated for the period, despite the usually small size of the gems. In the 5th century gems became somewhat larger, but still only 2-3 centimetres tall. Despite this, very fine detail is shown, including the eyelashes on one male head, perhaps a portrait. Four gems signed by Dexamenos of Chios are the finest of the period, two showing herons.

Relief carving became common in 5th century BC Greece, and gradually most of the spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the Sassanian and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it was the owner of the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as jewellery pendants in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals – later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse (""mirror-writing"") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original.
The cameo, which is rare in intaglio form, seems to have reached Greece around the 3rd century; the Farnese Tazza is the only major surviving Hellenistic example (depending on the date assigned to the Gonzaga Cameo – see below), but other glass-paste imitations with portraits suggest that gem-type cameos were made in this period. The conquests of Alexander the Great had opened up new trade routes to the Greek world and increased the range of gemstones available. Roman gems generally continued Hellenistic styles, and can be hard to date, until their quality sharply declines at the end of the 2nd century AD. Philosophers are sometimes shown; Cicero refers to people having portraits of their favourite on their cups and rings. The Romans invented cameo glass, best known from the Portland Vase, as a cheaper material for cameos, and one that allowed consistent and predictable layers on even round objects.

During the European Middle Ages antique engraved gems were one classical art form which was always highly valued, and a large but unknown number of ancient gems have (unlike most surviving classical works of art) never been buried and then excavated. Gems were used to decorate elaborate pieces of goldsmith work such as votive crowns, book-covers and crosses, sometimes very inappropriately given their subject matter. Matthew Paris illustrated a number of gems owned by St Albans Abbey, including one large Late Roman imperial cameo (now lost) called Kaadmau which was used to induce overdue childbirths – it was slowly lowered, with a prayer to St Alban, on its chain down the woman's cleavage, as it was believed that the infant would flee downwards to escape it, a belief in accordance with the views of the ""father of mineralogy"", Georgius Agricola (1494–1555) on jasper. Some gems were engraved, mostly with religious scenes in intaglio, during the period both in Byzantium and Europe.
In the West production revived from the Carolingian period, when rock crystal was the commonest material. The Lothair Crystal (or Suzanna Crystal, British Museum, 11.5 cm diameter), clearly not designed for use as a seal, is the best known of 20 surviving Carolingian large intaglio gems with complex figural scenes, although most were used for seals. Several crystals were designed, like the Susanna Crystal, to be viewed through the gem from the unengraved side, so their inscriptions were reversed like the seals. In wills and inventories, engraved gems were often given pride of place at the head of a list of treasures.
Some gems in a remarkably effective evocation of classical style were made in Southern Italy for the court of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in the first half of the 13th century, several in the Cabinet des Médailles in Paris. Meanwhile, the church led the development of large, often double-sided, metal seal matrices for wax seals that were left permanently attached to charters and similar legal documents, dangling by a cord, though smaller ring seals that were broken when a letter was opened remained in use. It is not clear to what extent this also continued practices in the ancient world.


== Renaissance revival ==

The late medieval French and Burgundian courts collected and commissioned gems, and began to use them for portraits. The British Museum has what is probably a seated portrait of John, Duke of Berry in intaglio on a sapphire, and the Hermitage has a cameo head of Charles VII of France.
Interest had also revived in Early Renaissance Italy, where Venice soon became a particular centre of production. Along with the Roman statues and sarcophagi being newly excavated, antique gems were prime sources for artists eager to regain a classical figurative vocabulary. Cast bronze copies of gems were made, which circulated around Italy, and later Europe. Among very many examples of borrowings that can be traced confidently, the Felix or Diomedes gem owned by Lorenzo de' Medici (see below), with an unusual pose, was copied by Leonardo da Vinci and may well have provided the ""starting point"" for one of Michelangelo's ignudi on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Another of Lorenzo's gems supplied, probably via a drawing by Perugino, a pose used by Raphael.
By the 16th century carved and engraved gems were keenly collected across Europe for dedicated sections of a cabinet of curiosities, and their production revived, in classical styles; 16th-century gem-cutters working with the same types of sardonyx and other hardstones and using virtually the same techniques, produced classicizing works of glyptic art, often intended as forgeries, in such quantity that they compromised the market for them, as Gisela Richter observed in 1922.  Even today, Sir John Boardman admits that ""We are sometimes at a loss to know whether what we are looking at belongs to the 1st or the 15th century AD, a sad confession for any art-historian."" Other Renaissance gems reveal their date by showing mythological scenes derived from literature that were not part of the visual repertoire in classical times, or borrowing compositions from Renaissance paintings, and using ""compositions with rather more figures than any ancient engraver would have tolerated or attempted"". Among artists, the wealthy Rubens was a notable collector.


== Parallel traditions ==
Engraved gems occur in the Bible, especially when the hoshen and ephod worn by the High Priest are described; though these were inscribed with the names of the tribes of Israel in letters, rather than any images. A few identifiably Jewish gems survive from the classical world, including Persia, mostly with the owner's name in Hebrew, but some with symbols such as the menorah. Many gems are inscribed in the Islamic world, typically with verses from the Koran, and sometimes gems in the Western tradition just contain inscriptions.
Many Asian and Middle Eastern cultures have their own traditions, although for example the important Chinese tradition of carved gemstones and hardstones, especially jade carving, is broader than the European one of concentration on a flattish faced stone that might fit into a ring. Seal engraving covers the inscription that is printed by stamping, which nearly always only contains script rather than images. Other decoration of the seal itself was not intended to be reproduced.


== Iconography ==

The iconography of gems is similar to that of coins, though more varied. Early gems mostly show animals. Gods, satyrs, and mythological scenes were common, and famous statues often represented – much modern knowledge of the poses of lost Greek cult statues such as Athena Promachos comes from the study of gems, which often have clearer images than coins. A 6th(?) century BC Greek gem already shows Ajax committing suicide, with his name inscribed. The story of Heracles was, as in other arts, the most common source of narrative subjects. A scene may be intended as the subject of an early Archaic gem, and certainly appears on 6th century examples from the later Archaic period.
Portraits of monarchs are found from the Hellenistic period onwards, although as they do not usually have identifying inscriptions, many fine ones cannot be identified with a subject. In the Roman Imperial period, portraits of the imperial family were often produced for the court circle, and many of these have survived, especially a number of spectacular cameos from the time of Augustus. As private objects, produced no doubt by artists trained in the tradition of Hellenistic monarchies, their iconography is less inhibited than the public state art of the period about showing divine attributes as well as sexual matters. The identity and interpretation of figures in the Gemma Augustea remains unclear. A number of gems from the same period contain scenes apparently from the lost epic on the Sack of Troy, of which the finest is by Dioskurides (Chatsworth House).
Renaissance and later gems remain dominated by the Hellenistic repertoire of subjects, though portraits in contemporary styles were also produced.


== Collectors ==

Famous collectors begin with King Mithridates VI of Pontus (d. 63 BC), whose collection was part of the booty of Pompey the Great, who donated it to the Temple of Jupiter in Rome. Julius Caesar was determined to excel Pompey in this as in other areas, and later gave six collections to his own Temple of Venus Genetrix; according to Suetonius gems were among his varied collecting passions. Many later emperors also collected gems. Chapters 4-6 of Book 37 of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder give a summary art history of the Greek and Roman tradition, and of Roman collecting. According to Pliny Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC) was the first Roman collector.
As in later periods objects carved in the round from semi-precious stone were regarded as a similar category of object; these are also known as hardstone carvings.  One of the largest, the Coupe des Ptolémées was probably donated to the Basilica of Saint-Denis, near Paris, by Charles the Bald, as the inscription on its former gem-studded gold Carolingian mounting stated; it may have belonged to Charlemagne. One of the best collections of such vessels, though mostly plain without carved decoration, was looted from Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, and is in the Treasury of the Basilica of San Marco in Venice. Many of these retain the medieval mounts which adapted them for liturgical use. Like the Coupe des Ptolémées, most objects in European museums lost these when they became objects of classicist interest from the Renaissance onwards, or when the mounts were removed for the value of the materials, as happened to many in the French Revolution.

The collection of 827 engraved gems of Pope Paul II, which included the ""Felix gem"" of Diomedes with the Palladium, was acquired by Lorenzo il Magnifico; the Medici collection included many other gems and was legendary, valued in inventories much higher than his Botticellis. Somewhat like Chinese collectors, Lorenzo had all his gems inscribed with his name.
The Gonzaga Cameo passed through a series of famous collections before coming to rest in the Hermitage. First known in the collection of Isabella d'Este, it passed to the Gonzaga Dukes of Mantua, Emperor Rudolf II, Queen Christina of Sweden, Cardinal Decio Azzolini, Livio Odescalchi, Duke of Bracciano, and Pope Pius VI before Napoleon carried it off to Paris, where his Empress Joséphine gave it to Alexander I of Russia after Napoleon's downfall, as a token of goodwill. It remains disputed whether the cameo is Alexandrian work of the 3rd century BC, or a Julio-Claudian imitation of the style from the 1st century AD.
Three of the largest cameo gems from antiquity were created for members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and seem to have survived above ground since antiquity. The large Gemma Augustea appeared in 1246 in the treasury of the Basilique St-Sernin, Toulouse. In 1533, King François I appropriated it and moved it to Paris, where it soon disappeared around 1590. Not long thereafter it was fenced for 12,000 gold pieces to Emperor Rudolph II; it remains in Vienna, alongside the Gemma Claudia. The largest flat engraved gem known from antiquity is the Great Cameo of France, which entered (or re-entered) the French royal collection in 1791 from the treasury of Sainte-Chapelle, where it had been since at least 1291.

In England, a false dawn of gem collecting was represented by Henry, Prince of Wales' purchase of the cabinet of the Flemish antiquary Abraham Gorlaeus in 1609, and engraved gems featured among the antiquities assembled by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel. Later in the century William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire, formed a collection of gems that is still conserved at Chatsworth. In the eighteenth century a more discerning cabinet of gems was assembled by Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle, acting upon the advice of Francesco Maria Zanetti and Francesco Ficoroni; 170 of the Carlisle gems, both Classical and post-Classical, were purchased in 1890 for the British Museum.
By the mid-eighteenth century prices had reached such a level that major collections could only be formed by the very wealthy; lesser collectors had to make do with collecting plaster casts, which was also very popular, or buying one of many sumptuously illustrated catalogues of collections that were published. Catherine the Great's collection is in the Hermitage Museum; one large collection she had bought was the gems from the Orléans Collection. Louis XV of France hired Dominique Vivant to assemble a collection for Madame de Pompadour.

In the eighteenth century British aristocrats were able to outcompete even the agents for royal and princely collectors on the Continent, aided by connoisseur-dealers like Count Antonio Maria Zanetti and Philipp von Stosch. Zanetti travelled Europe in pursuit of gems hidden in private collections for the British aristocrats he tutored in connoisseurship; his own collection was described in A.F. Gori, Le gemme antiche di Anton Maria Zanetti (Venice, 1750), illustrated with eighty plates of engravings from his own drawings. Baron Philipp von Stosch (1691–1757), a Prussian who lived in Rome and then Florence, was a major collector, as well as a dealer in engraved gems: ""busy, unscrupulous, and in his spare time a spy for England in Italy"". Among his contemporaries, Stosch made his lasting impression with Gemmæ Antiquæ Cælatæ (Pierres antiques graveés) (1724), in which Bernard Picart's engravings reproduced seventy antique carved hardstones like onyx, jasper and carnelian from European collections. He also encouraged Johann Lorenz Natter (1705–1763) whom Stosch set to copying ancient carved gems in Florence. Frederick the Great of Prussia bought Stosch's collection in 1765 and built the Antique Temple in the park of the Sanssouci Palace to house his collections of ancient sculpture, coins and over 4,000 gems – the two were naturally often grouped together. The gems are now in the Antikensammlung Berlin.

The collection of Joseph Smith, British consul in Venice was bought by King George III of Great Britain and remains in the Royal Collection. The collections of Charles Towneley, Richard Payne Knight and Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode were bought by or bequeathed to the British Museum, founding their very important collection.
But the most famous English collection was that formed by the 4th Duke of Marlborough (1739–1817), ""which the Duke kept in his bedroom and resorted to as a relief from his ambitious wife, his busy sister and his many children"". This included collections formerly owned by the Gonzagas of Mantua (later owned by Lord Arundel), the 2nd Earl of Bessborough, and the brother of Lord Chesterfield, who himself warned his son in one of his Letters against ""days lost in poring upon imperceptible intaglios and cameos"". The collection, including its single most famous cameo, the ""Marlborough gem"" depicting an initiation of Cupid and Psyche, was dispersed after a sale in 1899, fortunately timed for the new American museums and provided the core of the collection of the Metropolitan in New York and elsewhere, with the largest group still together being about 100 in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.
Prince Stanisław Poniatowski (1754–1833) ""commissioned about 2500 gems and encouraged the belief that they were, in fact, ancient."" He presented a set of 419 plaster impressions of his collection of Poniatowski gems to the King of Prussia which now form the Daktyliothek Poniatowski in Berlin, where they were recognised as modern in 1832, mainly because the signatures of ancient artists from very different times were found on gems in too consistent a style.


== Artists ==

As in other fields, not many ancient artists' names are known from literary sources, although some gems are signed. According to Pliny, Pyrgoteles was the only artist allowed to carve gems for the seal rings of Alexander the Great. Most of the most famous Roman artists were Greeks, like Dioskurides, who is thought to have produced the Gemma Augustea, and is recorded as the artist of the matching signet rings of Augustus – very carefully controlled, they allowed orders to be issued in his name by his most trusted associates. Other works survive signed by him (rather more than are all likely to be genuine), and his son Hyllos was also a gem engraver.
The Anichini family were leading artists in Venice and elsewhere in the 15th and 16th centuries. Many Renaissance artists no doubt kept their activities quiet, as they were passing their products off as antique. Other specialist carvers included Giovanni Bernardi (1494–1553), Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio (c. 1500–1565), Giuseppe Antonio Torricelli (1662–1719), the German-Italian Anton Pichler (1697–1779) and his sons Giovanni and Luigi, Charles Christian Reisen (Anglo-Norwegian, 1680–1725). Other sculptors also carved gems, or had someone in their workshop who did. Leone Leoni said he personally spent two months on a double-sided cameo gem with portraits of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and his wife and son.
The Scot James Tassie (1735–1799), and his nephew William (1777–1860) developed methods for taking hard impressions from old gems, and also for casting new designs from carved wax in enamel, enabling a huge production of what are really imitation engraved gems. The fullest catalogue of his impressions (""Tassie gems"") was published in 1791, with 15,800 items. There are complete sets of the impressions in the Hermitage, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, and in Edinburgh. Other types of imitation became fashionable for ladies' brooches, such as ceramic cameos by Josiah Wedgwood in jasperware. The engraved gem fell permanently out of fashion from about the 1860s, perhaps partly as a growing realization of the number of gems that were not what they seemed to be scared collectors. Among the last practitioners was James Robertson, who sensibly moved into the new art of photography. Perhaps the best known gem engraver of the 20th century, working in a contemporary idiom, is the British artist Ronald Pennell, whose work is held in the British Crafts Council Collection among many others.


== Imitations ==

Cameo glass was invented by the Romans in about 30BC to imitate engraved hardstone cameos, with the advantage that consistent layering could be achieved even on round vessels – impossible with natural gemstones. It was however very difficult to manufacture and surviving pieces, most famously the Portland Vase, are actually much rarer than Roman gemstone cameos. The technique was revived in the 18th and especially 19th centuries in England and elsewhere, and was most effectively used in French Art Nouveau glass that made no attempt to follow classical styles.
The Middle Ages, which lived by charters and other sealed documents, were at least as keen on using seals as the ancient world, now creating them for towns and church institutions, but they normally used metal matrices and signet rings. However some objects, like a 13th-century Venetian Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, mimicked the engraved gem.
Another offshoot of the mania for engraved gems is the fine-grained slightly translucent stoneware called jasperware that was developed by Josiah Wedgwood and perfected in 1775. Though white-on-blue matte jasperware is the most familiar Wedgwood ceramic line, still in production today and widely imitated since the mid-19th century, white-on-black was also produced. Wedgwood made notable jasperware copies of the Portland Vase and the Marlborough gem, a famous head of Antinous, and interpreted in jasperware casts from antique gems by James Tassie. John Flaxman's neoclassical designs for jasperware were carried out in the extremely low relief typical of cameo production. Some other porcelain imitated three-layer cameos purely by paint, even in implausible objects like a flat Sèvres tea-tray of 1840.


== Scholars ==
Gems were a favourite topic for antiquaries from the Renaissance onwards, culminating in the work of Philipp von Stosch, described above. Major progress in understanding Greek gems was made in the work of Adolf Furtwängler (1853–1907, father of the conductor, Wilhelm). Among recent scholars Sir John Boardman (b. 1927) has made a special contribution, again concentrating on Greek gems. Gertrud Seidmann (1919–2013) moved into the subject, having previously been a German teacher.

Heresy,"Heresy is a word used by different religious groups, used to describe someone who has ideas that are different from what the religion or law teaches. Such a person is known as heretic. 
In the Middle Ages it was not uncommon to accuse someone of heresy. If the accusations could be proven, the culprit would go through a ritual. Since torture could be used, the accusations were often proven. The ritual was done to save the soul of the convicted criminal.  It involved being burnt while tied to a post.
Still in the 21st century Muslims who apostatize are often treated very harshly and frequently killed.
Jesus Christ himself was regarded as a heretic by the Jewish leaders at the time- see Gospel of Matthew 26:57-67
The Roman Catholic Church in early times had great trouble with heretical christological doctrines, such as Monophysitism and Arianism. The Church sees several heresies in Protestantism:

Protestants claim only scripture (the Bible) is relevant for the faith (sola scriptura); the Catholic Church says traditions are also important.
Protestants say that belief is enough to be saved (sola fide). Catholics say that good deeds are necessary as well.
Protestants say that anyone can be a priest; the only requirement is that the person is baptised. In the Catholic and Orthodox churches, priests are ordained. This means that some people are not priests, even though they have been baptised.
According to Protestants, there is no Transubstantiation during mass (liturgy).
The Roman Missal contains heresies, according to Protestants
As a result of the Protestant Reformation, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was created in the Roman Catholic Church which protects the Church against heresies. It is the last instance to decide what constitutes a heresy, and how to deal with it.

Mahogany,"Mahogany is a straight-grained, reddish-brown timber of three tropical hardwood species of the genus Swietenia, indigenous to the Americas and part of the pantropical chinaberry family, Meliaceae. Mahogany is used commercially for a wide variety of goods, due to its coloring and durable nature. It is naturally found within the Americas, but has also been imported to plantations across Asia and Oceania. The mahogany trade may have begun as early as the 16th century and flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries. In certain countries, mahogany is considered an invasive species.
Mahogany is wood from any of three tree species: Honduran or big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), West Indian or Cuban mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), and Swietenia humilis. Honduran mahogany is the most widespread and the only genuine mahogany species commercially grown today. Mahogany is a valuable lumber used for paneling, furniture, boats, musical instruments, and other items. The United States is the leading importer of mahogany, while Peru is the largest exporter. Mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize.
Swietenia species have been introduced in various countries outside the Americas since the 1800s, with many plantings becoming naturalized forests. All species of Swietenia are now listed by CITES and protected due to concerns over illegal logging and mismanagement. Mahogany species can crossbreed when they grow in proximity, and the hybrid between S. mahagoni and S. macrophylla is widely planted for timber.
The history of the American mahogany trade dates back to the 17th century when the wood was first noticed by Europeans during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Mahogany became more popular in the 18th century when the British Parliament removed import duties on timber from British possessions, leading to increased exports to Europe and North America. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, mahogany from various regions was imported into Europe and North America, with Britain being the largest consumer.
By the late 19th century, African mahogany began to dominate the market, and by the early 20th century, the supply of American mahogany became scarcer. In response to concerns about the sustainability of mahogany, several species have been placed on CITES Appendices to regulate the trade.
Mahogany is known for its straight, fine grain and durability, making it a popular choice for fine furniture, boat construction, and musical instruments. However, the over-harvesting of mahogany and environmental concerns have led to a decrease in its use.


== Etymology ==
The etymology of mahogany is uncertain and a subject of debate. The term first appeared in John Ogilby's ""America"" (1671), referring to a ""curious and rich wood"" from Jamaica. Initial mentions of the mahogany tree (as opposed to wood) date to 1731, with its first detailed description in 1743, attributed to Swietenia mahagoni by Kemp Malone in 1940. Malone suggested that mahogany originated as a generic term for 'wood' in a native Bahamian language. F. Bruce Lamb disagreed, pointing out that the Arawak language's word for wood is caoba. Lamb identified a West African origin for the word in the Yoruba oganwo, collectively m'oganwo (meaning one which is the tallest or most high) used for the Khaya genus of trees, whose timber is today called African mahogany. Lamb proposes that Yoruba and Igbo people brought to Jamaica as slaves identified the local trees of the Swietenia genus as m'oganwo, which developed into the Portuguese term mogano, which first appeared in print as the name of a river in 1661, before finally developing into the English mahogany in Jamaica between 1655 and 1670. 
Malone criticized this etymology, arguing that the proposed metamorphosis from the Yoruba m'oganwo to the Portuguese mogano to the English mahogany was a logical and linguistic stretch relying on the conversion of the singular oganwo to the collective m'oganwo, which Malone finds unlikely considering the tree's generally solitary nature. He also argues that Lamb's earliest identified use of the Portuguese mog(a)no, which is for a river that Lamb asserts must have been so named for the mahogany oganwo trees on its banks, could just as well have been named for any tall tree, since oganwo only means tall. Lamb, in turn, criticized Malone's methodology and perceived bias, and maintained that there is no evidence for mahogany as a generic word.


== Description ==
The three species are:

Honduran or big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), with a range from Mexico to southern Amazonia in Brazil, the most widespread species of mahogany and the only genuine mahogany species commercially grown today. Illegal logging of S. macrophylla, and its highly destructive environmental effects, led to the species' placement in 2003 on Appendix II of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the first time that a high-volume, high-value tree was listed on Appendix II.
West Indian or Cuban mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), native to southern Florida and the Caribbean, formerly dominant in the mahogany trade, but not in widespread commercial use since World War II.
Swietenia humilis, a small and often twisted mahogany tree limited to seasonally dry forests in Pacific Central America that is of limited commercial utility. Some botanists believe that S. humilis is a mere variant of S. macrophylla.
While only the three Swietenia species are classified officially as ""genuine mahogany"", other Meliaceae species with timber uses are classified as ""true mahogany"". Some may or may not have the word mahogany in their trade or common name. Some of these true mahoganies include the African genera Khaya (African mahogany) and Entandrophragma (sapele mahogany); New Zealand mahogany or kohekohe (Dysoxylum spectabile); Chinese mahogany, Toona sinensis; Indonesian mahogany, Toona sureni; Indian mahogany, Toona ciliata; Chinaberry, Melia azedarach; Pink Mahogany (or Bosse), Guarea; Chittagong (also known as Indian Mahogany), Chukrasia velutina; and Crabwood Carapa guianensis. Some members of the genus Shorea (Meranti, Balau, or Lauan) of the family Dipterocarpaceae are also sometimes sold as Philippine mahogany, although the name is more properly applied to another species of Toona, Toona calantas.

Mahogany is a commercially important lumber prized for its beauty, durability, and color, and used for paneling and to make furniture, boats, musical instruments and other items. The leading importer of mahogany is the United States, followed by Britain; while the largest exporter today is Peru, which surpassed Brazil after that country banned mahogany exports in 2001. It is estimated that some 80 or 90 percent of Peruvian mahogany exported to the United States is illegally harvested, with the economic cost of illegal logging in Peru placed conservatively at $40–70 million USD annually. It was estimated that in 2000, some 57,000 mahogany trees were harvested to supply the U.S. furniture trade alone.
Mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize. A mahogany tree with two woodcutters bearing an axe and a paddle also appears on the Belizean national coat of arms, under the national motto, Sub umbra floreo, Latin for ""under the shade I flourish.""
The specific density of mahogany is 0.55. Mahogany, African: (500–850 kg/m3); Mahogany, Cuban: 660 kg/m3; Mahogany, Honduras: 650 kg/m3; Mahogany, Spanish: 850 kg/m3.


== Overview ==


=== Distribution ===
The natural distribution of these species within the Americas is geographically distinct. S. mahagoni grows on the West Indian islands as far north as the Bahamas, the Florida Keys and parts of Florida; S. humilis grows in the dry regions of the Pacific coast of Central America from south-western Mexico to Costa Rica; S. macrophylla grows in Central America from Yucatan southwards and into South America, extending as far as Peru, Bolivia and extreme western Brazil. In the 20th century various botanists attempted to further define S. macrophylla in South America as a new species, such as S. candollei Pittier and S. tessmannii Harms., but many authorities consider these spurious. According to Record and Hess, all of the mahogany of continental North and South America can be considered as one botanical species, Swietenia macrophylla King.
Both major species of Swietenia were introduced in several countries outside of the Americas during the 1800s and early 1900s using seeds from South America and the Caribbean. Many of these plantings became naturalized forests over time.
India had both S. macrophylla and S. mahagoni introduced in 1865 using seeds from West Indies. Both eventually became naturalized forests. Bangladesh had Honduran S. macrophylla introduced in 1872 and as with India it became naturalized in some areas. S. mahagoni and S. macrophylla were introduced in Indonesia in 1870 using seeds from India. S. macrophylla was included in plantation forests planted in Indonesia from the 1920s to the 1940s. Philippines had S. macrophylla introduced in 1907 and in 1913 as well as S. mahagoni in 1911, 1913, 1914, 1920 and 1922. Planting resumed in the late 1980s. It was planted with many other exotic tree species for the purpose of reforestation. S. macrophylla was planted in Sri Lanka in 1897 but it was left unmanaged until the 1950s when reforestation efforts initiated by the Sri Lankan government led to plantations being consciously developed. In the early 1900s S. mahagoni was planted on the islands of O'ahu and Maui in Hawaii but was neglected and became naturalized forests. Additionally, S. macrophylla was planted in 1922 on O'ahu and is now naturalized. Fiji had S. macrophylla introduced originally in 1911 as an ornamental species using seeds from Honduras and Belize. Fiji has become a major producer of mahogany in the 21st Century due to a robust plantation program spanning over 50 years. Harvesting began in 2003.


=== History ===
The name mahogany was initially associated only with those islands in the West Indies under British control (French colonists used the term acajou, while in the Spanish territories it was called caoba). The origin of the name is uncertain, but it could be a corruption of 'm'oganwo', the name used by the Yoruba and Ibo people of West Africa to describe trees of the genus Khaya, which is closely related to Swietenia. When transported to Jamaica as slaves, they gave the same name to the similar trees they saw there. Though this interpretation has been disputed, no one has suggested a more plausible origin. The indigenous Arawak name for the tree is not known. In 1671 the word mahogany appeared in print for the first time, in John Ogilby's America. Among botanists and naturalists, however, the tree was considered a type of cedar, and in 1759 was classified by Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) as Cedrela mahagoni. The following year it was assigned to a new genus by Nicholas Joseph Jacquin (1727–1817), and named Swietenia mahagoni.
Until the 19th century all of the mahogany was regarded as one species, although varying in quality and character according to soil and climate. In 1836 the German botanist Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini (1797–1848) identified a second species while working on specimens collected on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and named it Swietenia humilis. In 1886 a third species, Swietenia macrophylla, was named by Sir George King (1840–1909) after studying specimens of Honduras mahogany planted in the Botanic Gardens in Calcutta, India.
Today, all species of Swietenia grown in their native locations are listed by CITES, and are therefore protected. After S. mahogani and S. macrophylla were added to CITES appendixes in 1992 and 1995 respectively international conservation programs began in earnest aided by a 1993 World Bank report entitled ""Tropical Hardwood Marketing Strategies for Southeast Asia"". Efforts to repopulate mahogany largely failed in its native locations due to attacks from the shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella and similarly failed in Africa due to the attacks by the equivalent Hypsipyla robusta. After so many years of mismanagement and illegal logging, Swietenia also suffered from genetic loss thus mutating and weakening the seeds. Additionally erosion in its native locations meant seeds could no longer even be planted. However, both species grew well in Asia and Asia Pacific due to the absence of these shoot borers and absence of other limitations. Plantation management progressed throughout the 1990s and 2000s in Asia and the South Pacific. Global supply of genuine mahogany has been increasing from these plantations, notably Fiji, and Philippines. For Swietenia macrophylla, the trees in these plantations are still relatively young compared to the trees being harvested from old growth forests in South America. Thus, the illegal trade of bigleaf mahogany continues apace.


=== Species ===
Species of Swietenia cross-breed readily when they grow in proximity; the hybrid between S. mahagoni and S. macrophylla is widely planted for its timber.
In addition, the U.S. timber trade also markets various other Federal Trade Commission–defined species as mahoganies under a variety of different commercial names, most notably Philippine mahogany, which is actually from the genus Shorea, a dipterocarp. This wood is also called Lauan or Meranti.


== History of American mahogany trade ==

In the 17th century, the buccaneer Alexandre Exquemelin recorded the use of mahogany or Caoba (Cedrela being the Spanish name) on Hispaniola for making canoes: ""The Indians make these canoes without the use of any iron instruments, by only burning the trees at the bottom near the root, and afterwards governing the fire with such industry that nothing is burnt more than what they would have...""
The wood first came to the notice of Europeans with the beginning of Spanish colonisation in the Americas. A cross in the Cathedral at Santo Domingo, bearing the date 1514, is said to be mahogany, and Philip II of Spain apparently used the wood for the interior joinery of the palace El Escorial, begun in 1584. However, caoba, as the Taino Natives called the wood, was principally reserved for shipbuilding, and it was declared a royal monopoly at Havana in 1622. Hence very little of the mahogany growing in Spanish controlled territory found its way to Europe.
After the French established a colony in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), some mahogany from that island probably found its way to France, where joiners in the port cities of Saint-Malo, Nantes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux used the wood to a limited extent from about 1700. On the English-controlled islands, especially Jamaica and the Bahamas, mahogany was abundant but not exported in any quantity before 1700.


=== 18th century ===
While the trade in mahogany from the Spanish and French territories in America remained moribund for most of the 18th century, this was not true for those islands under British control. In 1721 the British Parliament removed all import duties from timber imported into Britain from British possessions in the Americas. This immediately stimulated the trade in West Indian timbers including, most importantly, mahogany. Importations of mahogany into England (and excluding those to Scotland, which were recorded separately) reached 525 tons per annum by 1740, 3,688 tons by 1750, and more than 30,000 tons in 1788, the peak year of the 18th century trade.
At the same time, the 1721 Act had the effect of substantially increasing exports of mahogany from the West Indies to the British colonies in North America. Although initially regarded as a joinery wood, mahogany rapidly became the timber of choice for makers of high quality furniture in both the British Isles and the 13 colonies of North America.

Until the 1760s over 90 per cent of the mahogany imported into Britain came from Jamaica. Some of this was re-exported to continental Europe, but most was used by British furniture makers. Quantities of Jamaican mahogany also went to the North American colonies, but most of the wood used in American furniture came from the Bahamas. This was sometimes called Providence wood, after the main port of the islands, but more often madera or madeira, which was the West Indian name for mahogany.
In addition to Jamaica and Bahamas, all the British controlled islands exported some mahogany at various times, but the quantities were not large. The most significant third source was Black River and adjacent areas on the Mosquito Coast (now Republic of Honduras), from where quantities of mahogany were shipped from the 1740s onwards. This mahogany was known as 'Rattan mahogany', after the island of Ruatan, which was the main offshore entrepot for the British settlers in the area.
At the end of the Seven Years' War (1756–63), the mahogany trade began to change significantly. During the occupation of Havana by British forces between August 1762 and July 1763, quantities of Cuban or Havanna mahogany were sent to Britain, and after the city was restored to Spain in 1763, Cuba continued to export small quantities, mostly to ports on the north coast of Jamaica, from where it went to Britain. However, this mahogany was regarded as inferior to the Jamaican variety, and the trade remained sporadic until the 19th century.
Another variety new to the market was Hispaniola mahogany, also called 'Spanish' and 'St Domingo' mahogany. This was the result of the Free Ports Act of 1766, which opened Kingston and other designated Jamaican ports to foreign vessels for the first time. The object was primarily to encourage importations of cotton from French plantations in Saint Domingue, but quantities of high quality mahogany were also shipped. These were then forwarded to Britain, where they entered the market in the late 1760s.

In terms of quantity, the most significant new addition to the mahogany trade was Honduras mahogany, also called 'baywood', after the Bay of Honduras. British settlers had been active in southern Yucatan since the beginning of the 18th century, despite the opposition of the Spanish, who claimed sovereignty over all of Central America.
Their main occupation was cutting logwood, a dyewood in high demand in Europe. The center of their activity and the primary point of export was Belize. Under Article XVII of the Treaty of Paris (1763), British cutters were for the first time given the right to cut logwood in Yucatan unmolested, within agreed limits. Such was the enthusiasm of the cutters that within a few years the European market was glutted, and the price of logwood collapsed.
However, the price of mahogany was still high after the war, and so the cutters turned to cutting mahogany. The first Honduras mahogany arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, in November 1763, and the first shipments arrived in Britain the following year.
By the 1790s most of the viable stocks of mahogany in Jamaica had been cut, and the market was divided between two principal sources or types of mahogany. Honduras mahogany was relatively cheap, plentiful, but rarely of the best quality. Hispaniola (also called Spanish or Santo Domingo) mahogany was the wood of choice for high quality work.
Data are lacking, but it is likely that the newly independent United States now received a good proportion of its mahogany from Cuba. In the last quarter of the 18th century France began to use mahogany more widely; they had ample supplies of high quality wood from Saint Domingue. The rest of Europe, where the wood was increasingly fashionable, obtained most of their wood from Britain.


=== Recent history ===
The French Revolution of 1789 and the wars that followed radically changed the mahogany trade, primarily due to the progressive collapse of the French and Spanish colonial empires, which allowed British traders into areas previously closed to them. Saint Domingue became the independent republic of Haiti, and from 1808, Spanish controlled Santo Domingo and Cuba were both open to British vessels for the first time.
From the 1820s mahogany from all these areas was imported into Europe and North America, with the majority of them going to Britain. In Central America British loggers moved northwest towards Mexico and south into Guatemala. Other areas of Central America as far south as Panama also began to be exploited.
The most important new development was the beginning of large scale logging in Mexico from the 1860s. Most mahogany was cut in the province of Tabasco and exported from a number of ports on the Gulf of Campeche, from Vera Cruz eastwards to Campeche and Sisal. By the end of the 19th century there was scarcely any part of Central America within reach of the coast untouched by logging, and activity also extended into Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Brazil.
Trade in American mahogany probably reached a peak in the last quarter of the 19th century. Figures are not available for all countries, but Britain alone imported more than 80,000 tons in 1875. This figure was not matched again. From the 1880s, African mahogany (Khaya spp.), a related genus, began to be exported in increasing quantities from West Africa, and by the early 20th century it dominated the market.
In 1907 the total of mahogany from all sources imported into Europe was 159,830 tons, of which 121,743 tons were from West Africa. By this time mahogany from Cuba, Haiti and other West Indian sources had become increasingly difficult to obtain in commercial sizes, and by the late 20th century Central American and even South American mahogany was heading in a similar direction. In 1975 S. humilis was placed on CITES Appendix II (a list of species that would be in danger of extinction without strict regulation) followed by S. mahagoni in 1992. The most abundant species, S. macrophylla, was placed on Appendix III in 1995 and moved to Appendix II in 2003.


== Uses ==

Mahogany has a straight, fine, and even grain, and is relatively free of voids and pockets. Its reddish-brown color darkens over time, and displays a reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, and is very durable.  Historically, the tree's girth allowed for wide boards from traditional mahogany species.  These properties make it a favorable wood for crafting cabinets and furniture.
Much of the first-quality furniture made in the American colonies from the mid 18th century was made of mahogany, when the wood first became available to American craftsmen. Mahogany is still widely used for fine furniture; however, the rarity of Cuban mahogany, the over-harvesting of Honduras and Brazilian mahogany, and the protests by indigenous peoples and environmental organizations from the 1980s into the 2000s, have diminished their use. Recent mahogany production from Mexico and Fiji has a lighter color and density than South American production from the early 20th century.
Mahogany also resists wood rot, making it attractive in boat construction and outdoor decking. It is a tonewood, often used for musical instruments, particularly the backs, sides and necks of acoustic guitars, electric guitar bodies, and drum shells because of its ability to produce a very deep, warm tone compared to other commonly used woods, such as maple, alder, ash (Fraxinus) or spruce. Guitars featuring mahogany in their construction include many acoustic guitars from Martin, Taylor, and Gibson, and Gibson electric guitars such as the Les Paul and SG. In the 1930s Gibson used the wood to make banjo necks as well.


== Mahogany as an invasive species ==

In the Philippines, environmentalists are calling for an end to the planting of mahogany because of its negative impact on the environment and wildlife, including possibly causing soil acidification and no net benefit to wildlife.

International Art Society & Academy,"The International Art Society & Academy (International Art Society and Academy, Διεθνής Εταιρεία Τέχνης και Ακαδημία) is an art association founded in 2007 by a Greek classical guitarist and composer Yorgos Foudoulis. The Society is in Volos, Greece.
Every year the society organizes international art competitions (Interartia, Ithagenia, World Award, World Book Award, Artist of the Year, World Poetry Competition ""Manolis Aligizakis"") dominantly in various fields of music, but also in poetry, plastic arts and other forms of artistic expression. 
Since its start the society awarded and collaborated famous and notable artists like Martha Argerich (the winner of the Japanese Premium Imperiale and 3 Grammy awards), Éric Pénicaud, Nobuyuki Tsujii, The Quartetto di Cremona, Peter Bence (Guinness World Record-breaking pianist with ""the fastest fingers on the planet""), Fraguial Francisco Guilherme de Almeida Jesus, Alondra de la Parra (the current Music Director of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra), Marco Minnemann, Tolgahan Çoğulu, Sungha Jung, Silesian Guitar Octet and many others. 
Within the society also is active the International Art Academy which is an examination board based on UK and US models (an international nonprofit training, education, and certifying organization) only for arts. Many well known artists serves as members, mentors or (honorary) professors like Małgorzata Chodakowska (sculpture), Tolgahan Çoğulu, Marios Joannou Elia, Dario Cebić, Pero Šiša, Thelxis Theohari (Θέλξη Θεοχάρη, the author of a number of the public monuments in Greece), Melissa Studdard (an author, the winner of a Forward National Literature Award and Pinnacle Book Achievement Award), Dimitris P. Kraniotis, Candice James (the poet laureate of New Westminster, British Columbia), Robert Hagan (a painter and the host of the Discovery HD/Discovery television show Splash of Color), Miran Vaupotich and others.
Yorgos Foudoulis is the president of the International Examination Center of the International Art Academy and the director of the Examination Center of Trinity College London.
In addition to these competitions, the International Academy of Arts, with the support of the Directorate for Organizational and Academic Development of the Greek Ministry of Education, traditionally organizes the World Poetry Competition 'K.P.Kavafis'. 
The International Examination Center at the International Art Academy in Volos acts under the legal framework of Examinations Boards, but all the certificates and substantial (earned) academic degrees in arts are currently issued in an honorary form in order to align itself to the present legal limitations in Greece (despite the fact that IAA is not the university or college per se). According to the State Constitution of Greece, ""education at the university level must be provided exclusively by institutions which are fully self-governed Public law legal bodies"".
In cooperation with the Foudoulis Conservatory, the World Guitar Festival Volos, World Guitar Orchestra Volos and World Guitar Center organize the World Composition Competition 'KITHARA' with an emphasis on guitar (solo guitar, musical ensembles, guitar ensembles, orchestras, etc.).

Prayer,"Prayer is a worship and communication to God.  Prayer can be spoken, silent (no talking), or in a song.  It can be used to praise God or to ask for something including help and forgiveness. 
Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set ritual or an individual invocation and can take the form of a hymn, a ritual statement, or a spontaneous expression. It can be done alone or in groups. 
In Christianity, prayers are varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. The most common prayer among Christians is the Lord's Prayer which, according to the gospel accounts, is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray.
In Islam, salat is observed three or (most commonly) five times every day at prescribed times.
Hinduism has prayer to various divinities or holy beings.


== Dua ==

duʿāʾ (Arabic: اَلدُّعَاءُ) is a prayer or request made by Muslims in which they ask for help from their God. Muslims see dua as a very serious way of worship.
Dua has been done by Muslims for a long time, as it is seen as very important by a lot of Muslims and Muslim families. They have been carried on as traditions.

Match,"A match is a tool for making fire under controlled circumstances. Most often, it is a small piece of wood, or hardened paper. At one end, the match is coated with a material that will ignite from friction. The lighting end of a match is known as the match ""head"". It contains an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder as the active ingredient and gelatin as a binder. Matches are sold in multiples, packaged together either in a box, or in matchbooks. There are two main types of matches: safety matches, which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface; and strike-anywhere matches, for which any suitably frictional surface can be used.
There are also electric matches, which use electricity and not friction to produce a fire.


== Early matches ==
Matches that used sulfur were mentioned by Martial in ancient Rome. He called them sulphurata.
Around the year 1530, Matches appeared in Europe. The first modern, self-igniting match was invented in 1805 by K. Chancel, assistant to Professor Louis Jacques Thénard of Paris, though. The head of the match was made of a mixture of potassium chlorate, sulfur, sugar, and rubber. They were ignited by dipping the tip of the match in a small asbestos bottle filled with sulfuric acid. This kind of match was quite expensive and its usage was dangerous, so Chancel's matches never gained much popularity.


== Special-purpose matches ==
Storm matches, also known as lifeboat matches or flare matches, have an easy to strike tip like a normal match, but much of the stick is coated with a combustible compound which will keep burning even in a strong wind. They have a wax coating to make them waterproof. They are a component of many survival kits. This particular match was used in the first mass-produced Molotov cocktails.
""Bengal matches"" are actually small hand-held fireworks akin to sparklers. They are similar to storm matches in form, but they include compounds of strontium or barium in the compound on the stick to produce a red or green flame respectively.

Natural theology,"Natural theology, once also termed physico-theology, is a type of theology that seeks to provide arguments for theological topics (such as the existence of a deity) based on reason and the discoveries of science, the project of arguing for the existence of God on the basis of observed natural facts, and through natural phenomena viewed as divine, or complexities of nature seen as evidence of a divine plan (see predestination) or Will of God,  which includes nature itself.
This distinguishes it from revealed theology, which is based on scripture and/or religious experiences, also from transcendental theology, which is based on a priori reasoning.  It is thus a type of philosophy, with the aim of explaining the nature of the celestial motors, or gods, or of one supreme god, that are responsible for heavenly motion.  Aristotle's tractate on metaphysics claims to demonstrate the necessary existence of an unmoved prime mover.
For monotheistic religions, this principally involves arguments about the attributes or non-attributes of a deity, and especially the deity's existence, using arguments that do not involve recourse to revelation.
The ideals of natural theology can be traced back to the Old Testament and Greek philosophy. Early sources evident of these ideals come from Jeremiah and the Wisdom of Solomon (c. 50 BC) and Plato's dialogue Timaeus (c. 360 BC).
Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BCE) established a distinction between political theology (the social functions of religion), natural theology and mythical theology. His terminology became part of the Stoic tradition and then Christianity through Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas.


== Ancient Greece ==

Besides Hesiod's Works and Days and Zarathushtra's Gathas, Plato gives the earliest surviving account of a natural theology. In the Timaeus, written c. 360 BCE, in the preamble to the account of the origin of the cosmos, we read: ""We must first investigate concerning [the whole Cosmos] that primary question which has to be investigated at the outset in every case,— namely, whether it has always existed, having no beginning or generation, or whether it has come into existence, having begun from some beginning."" The subsequent parts of the text argues for the necessity of a divine craftsman, who rationally constructed the cosmos out of pre-exisitng chaos (Timaeus 27d-30c) In the Laws, in answer to the question as to what arguments justify faith in the gods, Plato affirms: ""One is our dogma about the soul...the other is our dogma concerning the ordering of the motion of the stars"".


== Ancient Rome ==
Marcus Terentius Varro in his (lost) Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum (Antiquities of Human and Divine Things, 1st century BCE) established a distinction between three kinds of theology: civil (political) (theologia civilis), natural (physical) (theologia naturalis) and mythical (theologia mythica). The theologians of civil theology are ""the people"", asking how the gods relate to daily life and the state (imperial cult). The theologians of natural theology are the philosophers, asking about the nature of the gods, and the theologians of mythical theology are the poets, crafting mythology.


== Middle Ages ==
From the 8th century CE, the Mutazilite school of Islam, compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islam of their day, used philosophy for support, and were among the first to pursue a rational Islamic theology, termed Ilm-al-Kalam (scholastic theology). The teleological argument was later presented by the early Islamic philosophers Alkindus and Averroes, while Avicenna presented both the cosmological argument and the ontological argument in The Book of Healing (1027).
Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225 – 1274) presented several versions of the cosmological argument in his Summa Theologica, and of the teleological argument in his Summa contra Gentiles. He presented the ontological argument, but rejected it in favor of proofs that invoke cause and effect alone. His quinque viae (""five ways"") in those books attempted to demonstrate the existence of God in different ways, including (as way No. 5) the goal-directed actions seen in nature.


== Early modern ==
Raymond of Sabunde's (c. 1385–1436) Theologia Naturalis sive Liber Creaturarum, written 1434–1436, but published posthumously (1484), marks an important stage in the history of natural theology. John Ray (1627–1705) also known as John Wray, was an English naturalist, sometimes referred to as the father of English natural history. He published important works on plants, animals, and natural theology, with the objective ""to illustrate the glory of God in the knowledge of the works of nature or creation"". Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) established another term for natural theology as theodicy, defined exactly as ""the justification of God"". He viewed the science in a positive light as it supported his personal ethical belief system.
William Derham (1657–1735) continued Ray's tradition of natural theology in two of his own works, Physico-Theology, published during 1713, and Astro-Theology, 1714. These later influenced the work of William Paley.


== Nineteenth century ==
In An Essay on the Principle of Population, published during 1798, Thomas Malthus ended with two chapters on natural theology and population. Malthus—a devout Christian—argued that revelation would ""damp the soaring wings of intellect"", and thus never let ""the difficulties and doubts of parts of the scripture"" interfere with his work.
William Paley, an important influence on Charles Darwin, gave a well-known rendition of the teleological argument for God. During 1802 he published Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature. In this he described the Watchmaker analogy, for which he is probably best known. His book, which was one of the most-published books of the 19th and 20th centuries, presents a number of teleological and cosmological arguments for the existence of God. The book served as a template for many subsequent natural theologies during the 19th century.
The Bridgewater Treatises were eight works ""the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation"" published during the years 1833 to 1836.  They were written by eight scientific authors appointed by the President of the Royal Society using an £8000 bequest from Francis Henry Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater. The series, which was widely read, offered extensive discussion concerning the relationship between religion and science, and many of the authors offered observations on natural theology, although their views on the subject differed widely.  Responding critically to one of the series, Charles Babbage published what he termed The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise: A Fragment.
Professor of chemistry and natural history Edward Hitchcock also studied and wrote on natural theology. He attempted to unify and reconcile science and religion, emphasizing geology.  His major work of this type was The Religion of Geology and its Connected Sciences (1851).
The Gifford Lectures were established by the will of Adam Lord Gifford to ""promote and diffuse the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of the term—in other words, the knowledge of God."" The term ""natural theology"", as used by Gifford, refers to theology supported by science and not dependent on the miraculous.


== Criticism ==
The ideas of natural theology did not come without criticism. Many opposed the idea of natural theology, but some philosophers had a greater influence, including David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Søren Kierkegaard, and Charles Darwin. Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics also heavily opposed the entirety of natural theology.
David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion played a major role in Hume's standpoint on natural theology. Hume's ideas heavily stem from the idea of natural belief. It was stated that, ""Hume's doctrine of natural belief allows that certain beliefs are justifiably held by all men without regard to the quality of the evidence which may be produced in their favour"". However, Hume's argument also stems from the design argument. The design argument comes from people being labeled as morally good or evil. Hume's argument claims that if we restrict ourselves to the idea of good and evil, that we must also assign this to the designer as well. Hume states, ""I will allow that pain or misery in man is compatible with infinite power and goodness in the Deity...A mere possible compatibility is not sufficient. You must prove these pure, unmixt, and uncontrollable attributes..."". Hume argues for the idea of a morally perfect deity and requires evidence for anything besides that. Hume's arguments against natural theology had a wide influence on many philosophers.
Charles Darwin's criticism of the theory had a broader impact on scientists and commoners. Darwin's theories showed that humans and animals developed through an evolutionary process. This implied that a chemical reaction was occurring; but it had no influence from the idea of God. However, Darwin's ideas did not erase the question of how the original ideas of matter came to be.


=== Faith and fideism ===

Immanuel Kant and Søren Kierkegaard had similar ideas about natural theology. Kant's ideas focused more on the natural dialect of reason, while Kierkegaard focused more on the dialect of understanding. Both men suggest that ""the natural dialect leads to the question of God"". Kant argues for the idea that reason leads to the ideas of God as a regulative principle. Kierkegaard argues that the idea of understanding will ultimately lead itself to becoming faith. Both of these men argue that the idea of God cannot be based solely on the idea of reason, that the dialect and ideals will transcend into faith.
Karl Barth opposed the entirety of natural theology. Barth argued that ""by starting from such experience, rather that from the gracious revelation through Jesus Christ, we produce a concept of God that is the projection of the highest we know, a construct of human thinking, divorced from salvation history"". Barth argues that God is restricted by the construct of human thinking if he is divorced from salvation. Barth also acknowledges that God is knowable because of his grace. Barth's argument stems from the idea of faith rather than reason. Barth held that God can be known only through Jesus Christ, as revealed in scripture, and that any such attempts should be considered idolatry.
Søren Kierkegaard questioned the existence of God, rejecting all rational arguments for God's existence (including the teleological argument) on the grounds that reason is inevitably accompanied by doubt. He proposed that the argument from design does not take into consideration future events which may serve to undermine the proof of God's existence: the argument would never finish proving God's existence. In the Philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaard writes:

The works of God are such that only God can perform them. Just so, but where then are the works of the God? The works from which I would deduce his existence are not directly and immediately given. The wisdom in nature, the goodness, the wisdom in the governance of the world – are all these manifest, perhaps, upon the very face of things? Are we not here confronted with the most terrible temptations to doubt, and is it not impossible finally to dispose of all these doubts? But from such an order of things I will surely not attempt to prove God's existence; and even if I began I would never finish, and would in addition have to live constantly in suspense, lest something so terrible should suddenly happen that my bit of proof would be demolished.
Fideists may reject attempts to prove God's existence.

Gopher wood,"Gopher wood or gopherwood is a term used once in the Bible for the material used to construct Noah's ark. Genesis 6:14 states that Noah was instructed to build the Ark of gofer (גֹפֶר‎), commonly transliterated as gopher wood, a word not otherwise used in the Bible or the Hebrew language in general. Although some English Bibles attempt a translation, older English translations such as the King James Version (17th century) leave it untranslated. The word is unrelated to the North American animal known as the gopher.


== Identity ==
The Greek Septuagint (3rd–1st centuries BC) translated the phrase mentioning gopher wood as ἐκ ξύλων τετραγώνων (ek xúlōn tetragṓnōn), 'out of squared timber', translating gofer as squared.  Similarly, the Latin Vulgate (5th century AD) rendered it as de lignis levigatis (lævigatis, in the spelling of the Clementine Vulgate), 'of timber planks'.
The Jewish Encyclopedia states that it was most likely a translation of the Babylonian gushure iṣ erini, 'cedar beams', or the Assyrian giparu, 'reeds'. The Aramaic Targum Onkelos, considered by many Jews to be an authoritative translation of the Hebrew scripture, renders this word as qadros, 'cedar'. The Syriac Peshitta translates this word as arqa, 'box'.
Many modern English translations favor cypress (otherwise referred to in Biblical Hebrew as berosh). This was espoused (among others) by Adam Clarke, a Methodist theologian famous for his commentary on the Bible: Clarke cited a resemblance between the Greek word for cypress, kuparisson, and the Hebrew word gophar. Likewise, the Nova Vulgata (20th century) has it as de lignis cupressinis ('out of cypress wood').
Others, noting the visual similarity between the Hebrew letters g (gimel ג‎) and k (kaf כ‎), suggest that the word may actually be kopher, the Hebrew word meaning 'pitch'; thus kopher wood would be 'pitched wood'. Recent suggestions have included a lamination process (to strengthen the Ark), or a now-lost type of tree, but there is no consensus.

Fibre saturation point,"Fibre saturation point is a term used in wood mechanics and especially wood drying, to denote the point in the drying process at which only water bound in the cell walls remains - all other water, called free water, having been removed from the cell cavities. Further drying of the wood results in strengthening of the wood fibres, and is usually accompanied by shrinkage. Wood is normally dried to a point where it is in equilibrium with the atmospheric moisture content or relative humidity, and since this varies so does the equilibrium moisture content.
Laboratory testing has found the average FSP in many types of wood to be approximately 26%. Individual species may differ from the average.

Cremation,"Cremation is a method of final disposition of a dead body through burning.
Cremation may serve as a funeral or post-funeral rite and as an alternative to burial. In some countries, including India, Nepal, and Syria, cremation on an open-air pyre is an ancient tradition. Starting in the 19th century, cremation was introduced or reintroduced into other parts of the world. In modern times, cremation is commonly carried out with a closed furnace (cremator), at a crematorium.
Cremation leaves behind an average of 2.4 kg (5.3 lb) of remains known as ashes or cremains. This is not all ash but includes unburnt fragments of bone mineral, which are commonly ground into powder. They are inorganic and inert, and thus do not constitute a health risk and may be buried, interred in a memorial site, retained by relatives or scattered in various ways.


== History ==


=== Ancient ===

Cremation dates from at least 17,000 years ago in the archaeological record, with the Mungo Lady, the remains of a partly cremated body found at Lake Mungo, Australia.
Alternative death rituals which emphasize one method of disposal – burial, cremation, or exposure – have gone through periods of preference throughout history.
In the Middle East and Europe, both burial and cremation are evident in the archaeological record in the Neolithic era. Cultural groups had their own preferences and prohibitions. The ancient Egyptians developed an intricate transmigration-of-soul theology, which prohibited cremation. This was also widely adopted by Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to Herodotus, embalmed their dead. Phoenicians practiced both cremation and burial. From the Cycladic civilization in 3000 BCE until the Sub-Mycenaean era in 1200–1100 BCE, Greeks practiced burial. Cremation appeared around the 12th century BCE, probably influenced by Anatolia. Until the Christian era, when inhumation again became the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced, depending on the era and location. In Rome's earliest history, both inhumation and cremation were in common use among all classes. Around the mid-Republic, inhumation was almost exclusively replaced by cremation, with some notable exceptions, and remained the most common funerary practice until the middle of the Empire, when it was almost entirely replaced by inhumation.
In Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2000 BCE) in the Pannonian Plain and along the middle Danube. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the Urnfield culture (from c. 1300 BCE). In the Iron Age, inhumation again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the Villanovan culture and elsewhere. Homer's account of Patroclus' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a tumulus, similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the Iliad was written, centuries later.

Criticism of burial rites is a common aspersion by competing religions and cultures, including the association of cremation with fire sacrifice or human sacrifice.

Hinduism and Jainism are notable for not only allowing but prescribing cremation. Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture (from c. 1900 BCE), considered the last phase of Indus Valley Civilisation and beginning of the Vedic civilization. The Rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice, in RV 10.15.14, where the forefathers ""both cremated (agnidagdhá-) and uncremated (ánagnidagdha-)"" are invoked.
Cremation remained common but not universal, in both ancient Greece and ancient Rome. According to Cicero, burial was considered the more archaic rite in Rome.
The rise of Christianity saw an end to cremation in Europe, though it may have already been in decline.
In early Roman Britain, cremation was usual but diminished by the 4th century. It then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included on the pyre, and the dead were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the Anglo-Saxon migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period. These ashes were usually thereafter deposited in a vessel of clay or bronze in an ""urn cemetery"". The custom again died out with the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons or Early English during the 7th century, when Christian burial became general.


=== Middle Ages ===
In parts of Europe, cremation was forbidden by law, and even punishable by death if combined with Heathen rites. Cremation was sometimes used by Catholic authorities as part of punishment for accused heretics, which included burning at the stake. For example, the body of John Wycliff was exhumed years after his death and burned to ashes, with the ashes thrown in a river, explicitly as a posthumous punishment for his denial of the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation.
The first to advocate for the use of cremation was the physician Sir Thomas Browne in Urne Buriall (1658) which interpreted cremation as means of oblivion and reveals plainly that ""'there is no antidote against the Opium of time..."". Honoretta Brooks Pratt became the first recorded cremated European individual in modern times when she died on 26 September 1769 and was illegally cremated at the burial ground on Hanover Square in London.


=== Reintroduction ===

In Europe, a movement to reintroduce cremation as a viable method for body disposal began in the 1870s. This was made possible by the invention of new furnace technology and contact with eastern cultures that practiced it. At the time, many proponents believed in the miasma theory, and that cremation would reduce the ""bad air"" that caused diseases. These movements were associated with secularism and gained a following in cultural and intellectual circles. In Italy, the movement was associated with anti-clericalism and Freemasonry, whereas these were not major themes of the movement in Britain.
In 1869, the idea was presented to the Medical International Congress of Florence by Professors Coletti and Castiglioni ""in the name of public health and civilization"". In 1873, Professor Paolo Gorini of Lodi and Professor Ludovico Brunetti of Padua published reports of practical work they had conducted. A model of Brunetti's cremating apparatus, together with the resulting ashes, was exhibited at the Vienna Exposition in 1873 and attracted great attention Meanwhile, Sir Charles William Siemens had developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s. His furnace operated at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, Carl Friedrich von Siemens perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in Dresden. The radical politician, Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.
The first crematorium in the Western World opened in Milan in 1876. Milan's ""Crematorium Temple"" was built in the Monumental Cemetery. The building still stands but ceased to be operational in 1992.

Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet, a surgeon and Physician to the Queen Victoria, had seen Gorini's cremator at the Vienna Exhibition and had returned home to become the first and chief promoter of cremation in England. His main reason for supporting cremation was that ""it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied"". In addition, he believed, cremation would prevent premature burial, reduce the expense of funerals, spare mourners the necessity of standing exposed to the weather during interment, and urns would be safe from vandalism. He joined with other proponents to form the Cremation Society of Great Britain in 1874."" They founded the United Kingdom's first crematorium in Woking, with Gorini travelling to England to assist the installation of a cremator. They first tested it on 17 March 1879 with the body of a horse. After protests and an intervention by the Home Secretary, Sir Richard Cross, their plans were put on hold. In 1884, the Welsh Neo-Druidic priest William Price was arrested and put on trial for attempting to cremate his son's body. Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that allowed the Cremation Society to proceed.
In 1885, the first official cremation in the United Kingdom took place in Woking. The deceased was Jeanette Pickersgill, a well-known figure in literary and scientific circles. By the end of the year, the Cremation Society of Great Britain had overseen 2 more cremations, a total of 3 out of 597,357 deaths in the UK that year. In 1888, 28 cremations took place at the venue. In 1891, Woking Crematorium added a chapel, pioneering the concept of a crematorium being a venue for funerals as well as cremation.

Other early crematoria in Europe were built in 1878 in the town of Gotha in Germany and later in Heidelberg in 1891. The first modern crematory in the U.S. was built in 1876 by Francis Julius LeMoyne after hearing about its use in Europe. Like many early proponents, he was motivated by a belief it would be beneficial for public health. Before LeMoyne's crematory closed in 1901, it had performed 42 cremations. Other countries that opened their first crematorium included Sweden (1887 in Stockholm), Switzerland (1889 in Zurich) and France (1889 in Père Lachaise, Paris).


=== Western spread ===
Some of the various Protestant churches came to accept cremation. In Anglican and Nordic Protestant countries, cremation gained acceptance (though it did not yet become the norm) first by the upper classes and cultural circles, and then by the rest of the population. In 1905, Westminster Abbey interred ashes for the first time; by 1911 the Abbey was expressing a preference for interring ashes. The 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia was critical of the development, referring to them as a ""sinister movement"" and associating them with Freemasonry, although it said that ""there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the Church in the practice of cremation.""
In the U.S. only about one crematory per year was built in the late 19th century. As embalming became more widely accepted and used, crematories lost their sanitary edge. Not to be left behind, crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful. They started building crematories with stained-glass windows and marble floors with frescoed walls.
Australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies. Australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the West Terrace Cemetery in the South Australian capital of Adelaide in 1901. This small building, resembling the buildings at Woking, remained largely unchanged from its 19th-century style and was in full operation until the late 1950s. The oldest operating crematorium in Australia is at Rookwood Cemetery, in Sydney. It opened in 1925.
In the Netherlands, the foundation of the Association for Optional Cremation in 1874 ushered in a long debate about the merits and demerits of cremation. Laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 (two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the Netherlands), though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955.


=== World War II ===
During World War II (1939–45), Nazi Germany used specially built furnaces in at least six extermination camps throughout occupied Poland including at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Chełmno, Belzec, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka, where the bodies of those murdered by gassing were disposed of using incineration. The efficiency of industrialised killing of Operation Reinhard during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust produced too many corpses, therefore the crematoria manufactured to SS specifications were put into use in all of them to handle the disposals around the clock, day and night. The Vrba–Wetzler report offers the following description. At present there are four crematoria in operation at BIRKENAU, two large ones, I and II, and two smaller ones, III and IV. Those of type I and II consist of 3 parts, i.e.,: (A) the furnace room; (B) the large halls; and (C) the gas chamber. A huge chimney rises from the furnace room around which are grouped nine furnaces, each having four openings. Each opening can take three normal corpses at once and after an hour and a half the bodies are completely burned. This corresponds to a daily capacity of about 2,000 bodies... Crematoria III and IV work on nearly the same principle, but their capacity is only half as large. Thus the total capacity of the four cremating and gassing plants at BIRKENAU amounts to about 6,000 daily.

The Holocaust furnaces were supplied by a number of manufacturers, with the best known and most common being Topf and Sons as well as Kori Company of Berlin, whose ovens were elongated to accommodate two bodies, slid inside from the back side. The ashes were taken out from the front side.


=== Modern era ===

In the 20th century, cremation gained varying degrees of acceptance in most Christian denominations. William Temple, the most senior bishop in the Church of England, was cremated after his death in office in 1944. The Roman Catholic Church accepted the practice more slowly. In 1963, at the Second Vatican Council Pope Paul VI lifted the ban on cremation, and in 1966 allowed Catholic priests to officiate at cremation ceremonies. This is done on the condition that the ashes must be buried or interred, not scattered. Many countries where burial is traditional saw cremation rise to become a significant, if not the most common way of disposing of a dead body. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an unprecedented phase of crematorium construction in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
Starting in the 1960s, cremation has become more common than burial in several countries where the latter is traditional. This has included the United Kingdom (1968), Czechoslovakia (1980), Canada (early 2000s), the United States (2016) and Finland (2017). Factors cited include cheaper costs (especially a factor after the 2008 recession), growth in secular attitudes and declining opposition in some Christian denominations.


== Modern process ==

The cremation occurs in a cremator, which is located at a crematorium or crematory. In many countries, the crematorium is a venue for funerals as well as cremation.
A cremator is an industrial furnace that is able to generate temperatures of 871–982 °C (1,600–1,800 °F) to ensure the disintegration of the corpse. Modern cremator fuels include oil, natural gas, propane, and, in Hong Kong, coal gas. Modern cremators automatically monitor their interior to tell when the cremation process is complete and have a spyhole so that an operator can see inside. The time required for cremation varies from body to body, with the average being 90 minutes for an adult body.
The chamber where the body is placed is called a cremation chamber or retort and is lined with heat-resistant refractory bricks. Refractory bricks are designed in several layers. The outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material, e.g., mineral wool. Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty cremators are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer. The layer of fire bricks in contact with the combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time.
The body is generally required to be inside a coffin or a combustible container. This allows the body to be quickly and safely slid into the cremator. It also reduces health risks to the operators. The coffin or container is inserted (charged) into the cremator as quickly as possible to avoid heat loss. Some crematoria allow relatives to view the charging. This is sometimes done for religious reasons, such as in traditional Hindu and Jain funerals, and is also customary in Japan.


=== Body container ===

In the United States federal law does not dictate any container requirements for cremation. Certain states require an opaque or non-transparent container for all cremations. This can be a simple corrugated cardboard box or a wooden casket (coffin). Another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell, which is designed to look like a traditional casket. After the funeral service, the box is removed from the shell before cremation, permitting the shell to be re-used.
In the United Kingdom, the body is not removed from the coffin and is not placed into a container as described above. The body is cremated with the coffin which is why all British coffins that are to be used for cremation must be combustible. The Code of Cremation Practice forbids the opening of the coffin once it has arrived at the crematorium, and rules stipulate that it must be cremated within 72 hours of the funeral service. Therefore, in the United Kingdom, bodies are cremated in the same coffin that they are placed in at the undertaker's, although the regulations allow the use of an approved ""cover"" during the funeral service. It is recommended that jewellery be removed before the coffin is sealed, for this reason. When cremation is finished, the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal, which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or, increasingly, recycled. The ashes are entered into a cremulator to further grind the remains down into a finer texture before being given to relatives or loved ones or scattered in the crematorium grounds where facilities exist.
In Germany, the process is mostly similar to that of the United Kingdom. The body is cremated in the coffin. A piece of fire clay with a number on it is used for identifying the remains of the dead body after burning. The remains are then placed in a container called an ash capsule, which generally is put into a cinerary urn.
In Australia, reusable or cardboard coffins are rare, with only a few manufacturers now supplying them. For low cost, a plain, particle-board coffin (known in the trade as a ""chippie"", ""shipper"" or ""pyro"") can be used. Handles (if fitted) are plastic and approved for use in a cremator.
Cremations can be ""delivery only"", with no preceding chapel service at the crematorium (although a church service may have been held) or preceded by a service in one of the crematorium chapels. Delivery-only allows crematoria to schedule cremations to make best use of the cremators, perhaps by holding the body overnight in a refrigerator, allowing a lower fee to be charged.

The box containing the body is placed in the retort and incinerated at a temperature of 760 to 1,150 °C (1,400 to 2,100 °F). During the cremation process, the greater portion of the body (especially the organs and other soft tissues) is vaporized and oxidized by the intense heat; gases released are discharged through the exhaust system.
Jewelry, such as necklaces, wrist-watches and rings, are ordinarily removed before cremation, and returned to the family. Several implanted devices are required to be removed. Pacemakers and other medical devices can cause large, dangerous explosions.
Contrary to popular belief, the cremated remains are not ashes in the usual sense. After the incineration is completed, the dry bone fragments are swept out of the retort and pulverised by a machine called a Cremulator—essentially a high-capacity, high-speed blender—to process them into ""ashes"" or ""cremated remains"", although pulverisation may also be performed by hand. This leaves the bone with a fine sand like texture and color, able to be scattered without need for mixing with any foreign matter, though the size of the grain varies depending on the Cremulator used. The mean weight of an adult's remains is 2.4 kg (5.3 lb); the mean weight for adult males is about 1 kg (2.2 lb) higher than that for adult females. There are various types of Cremulators, including rotating devices, grinders, and older models using heavy metal balls.
The grinding process typically takes about 20 seconds.

In most Asian countries, the bones are not pulverised, unless requested beforehand. When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.
The appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ashes, although a non-technical term sometimes used is ""cremains"", a portmanteau of ""cremated"" and ""remains"". (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word ""cremains"" not be used for referring to ""human cremated remains"". The reason given is that ""cremains"" is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one's ""cremated remains"" has a more identifiable human connection.)
After final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative urn. The default container used by most crematoria, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box.


=== Ash weight and composition ===

Cremated remains are mostly dry calcium phosphates with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although about 1–4% of carbon remains as carbonate.
The ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.
Ashes of adults can be said to weigh from 876 to 3,784 g (1 lb 15 oz to 8 lb 5 oz), with women's ashes generally weighing below 2,750 g (6 lb 1 oz) and men's ashes generally weighing above 1,887 g (4 lb 3 oz).
Bones are not all that remain after cremation. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and surgical implants, such as hip replacements. Breast implants do not have to be removed before cremation. Some medical devices such as pacemakers may need to be removed before cremation to avoid the risk of explosion. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground.) Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as gleanings) are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.


== Retention or disposal of remains ==

Cremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight polyethylene plastic bag contained within a hard snap-top rectangular plastic container, which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.
Cremated remains can be kept in an urn, stored in a special memorial building (columbarium), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or in the sea. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat or scattered from an aeroplane or drone. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies offer a service to turn part of the cremated remains into synthetic diamonds which can then be made into jewelry. This ""cremation jewelry"" is also known as funeral jewelry, remembrance jewelry or memorial jewelry. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes and glass orbs
Cremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight.
Ashes are alkaline. In some areas such as Snowdon, Wales, environmental authorities have warned that the frequent scattering of ashes can change the nature of the soil, and may affect the ecology.
The final disposition depends on the personal preferences of the deceased as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or retained at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, prefer to either bury or entomb the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river Ganges, preferably at one of the holy cities Triveni Sangam, Allahabad, Varanasi, or Haridwar in India. The Sikhs immerse the remains in the Sutlej, usually at Kiratpur Sahib. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river Kaveri at Paschima vahini in Srirangapattana at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment.


== Reasons ==

Aside from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some; many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body relatively quickly.
Other people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible. Cremation is a more simple disposition method to plan than a burial funeral. This is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods. With a burial funeral one will also have to purchase a casket, headstone, grave plot, opening and closing of the grave fee, and mortician fees. Cremation funerals only require planning the transportation of the body to a crematorium, cremation of the body, and a cremation urn.
The cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service, especially if direct cremation (also known as bare cremation) is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. For some, even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.
For surviving kin, cremation is preferred because of simple portability. Survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together.


== Environmental impact ==
Despite being an obvious source of carbon emissions, cremation does have environmental advantages over burial, depending on local practice. Studies by Elisabeth Keijzer for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial (the study did not address natural burials), while the newer method of alkaline hydrolysis (sometimes called green cremation or resomation) had less impact than both. The study was based on Dutch practice; American crematoria are more likely to emit mercury, but are less likely to burn hardwood coffins. Keijzer's studies also found that a cremation or burial accounts for only about a quarter of a funeral's environmental impact; the carbon emissions of people travelling to the funeral are far greater.
Each cremation requires about 110 L (28 US gal) of fuel and releases about 240 kg (540 lb) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce about 240,000 t (270,000 short tons) of carbon dioxide, which is more CO2 pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year. The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and relaxing the requirement for a cremation to take place on the same day that the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions. Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly toward the environment. Some funeral and crematorium owners offer a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board.
Burial is a known source of certain environmental contaminants, with the major ones being formaldehyde and the coffin itself. Cremation can also release contaminants, such as mercury from dental fillings. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, the law now requires that cremators be fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury.
Another environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a concrete vault or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns. Many cemeteries, particularly in Japan and Europe as well as those in larger cities, have run out of permanent space. In Tokyo, for example, traditional burial plots are extremely scarce and expensive, and in London, a space crisis led Harriet Harman to propose reopening old graves for ""double-de",1
Giuseppe Donatiello,"Giuseppe Donatiello (born 14 December 1967) is an Italian amateur astronomer. He is primarily known as the discoverer of eleven nearby dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.


== Contributions ==
He discovered in 2016 a dwarf galaxy about 10 million light years away in the constellation of Andromeda called Donatiello I. This is the first galaxy to be named after its non-professional discoverer.
In 2020, he discovered the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy named Pisces VII/Triangulum III which turned out to be a strong satellite candidate of the dwarf spiral galaxy Messier 33. Pisces VII is the first Local Group galaxy to be discovered by a non-professional astronomer.

Also in 2021, the discovery of three new satellites of the spiral galaxy NGC 253 was announced. These three new dwarf galaxies were named Donatiello II, III and IV. All were later observed and confirmed as satellites of NGC 253 by the Hubble Space Telescope.
In 2022, he discovered a very faint dwarf satellite galaxy of M31 which was named Pegasus V/Andromeda XXXIV. This object turned out to be particularly ancient and could be a fossil of the first star formation.
In 2024, the discovery of five more satellite galaxies of the NGC 253 galaxy was announced. The new objects were named Donatiello V, VI, VII, VIII and IX
To these discoveries must be added some candidate planetary nebulae and the participation in the discovery and analysis of several dozen stellar streams
He is the principal investigator and coordinator of the National Deep Sky Research Section of the Italian Amateur Astronomers Union

Wood flooring,"Wood flooring is a type of covering made from timber, used for either structural or decorative purposes. Wood is a popular material for flooring due to its variety in styles, colors, cuts, and species. While bamboo flooring is often grouped with wood flooring, it's actually made from bamboo, not timber.
Different types of finishes can be used on wood flooring. These include polyurethane, natural substances like shellac and varnishes, and oils. Some floors are also made smooth with brushing and oiling. Older wood floors usually need a process called buffing every few years to keep them smooth. This doesn't apply to floors made in factories. If wood floors get too old or worn, they may need to be refinished. This involves a process called sanding to make them smooth and look new again. In the past, floors were scraped to bring out fresh wood, but this can leave scratches. Now, we have machines to do this job more neatly.

Structural pipe fitting,"Structural pipe fitting is a pipe used for various structures.
A Structural pipe fitting, also known as a slip on pipe fitting, clamp or pipe clamp is used to build structures such as handrails, guardrails, and other types of pipe or tubular structure. They can also be used to build furniture and theatrical riggings. The fittings slip on the pipe and are usually locked down with a set screw. The set screw can then be tightened with a simple hex wench. Because of the modular design of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.
Other advantages of using structural pipe fittings are easy installation and reconfigurable design. Since there are no permanent welds in the structure, the set screws of the fittings can simply be loosened, allowing them to be repositioned. The project can be disassembled and stored if needed, or even taken apart with fittings and pipe recycled into a new project.
Fittings used for strong structures are galvanised malleable iron castings, and come in many styles such as elbows, tees, crosses, reducers and flanges. The fittings are not threaded; they simply lock onto the pipe with the supplied hex set screws.",0

Spruce-pine-fir,"Spruce-pine-fir (SPF) is a classification of lumber that can be traded on commodities exchanges.
In Canada, and parts of the United States, most of the spruce tree species, pine tree species, and fir tree species share similar physical and mechanical characteristics, to the point where lumber derived from any of these species are interchangeable for construction purposes. Therefore, it makes sense to harvest and process them together, and sell them as one product.
On some exchanges, there are different prices for Eastern and Western SPF varieties, and the price of Eastern SPF is generally higher than the price of Western SPF. When both types are sold together, the term Composite SPF is used. There is also utility-grade SPF, which is the lowest and cheapest grade.
Western SPF species generally grow faster and larger, but Eastern SPF species are generally stronger.


== Western SPF ==
Western SPF comes from the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, and the US states of California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming.
It consists of the following species:

White spruce (Picea glauca)
Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii)
Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)
Alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa)
Random-length lumber futures and options are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and western SPF is the type of lumber specified in the trading specs. The term random length is used because even though all the boards are 2x4s, the lengths can be between 2.4 and 6.1 metres (8 and 20 ft).


== Eastern SPF ==
Eastern SPF comes from the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador.
It consists of the following species:

Black spruce (Picea mariana)
Red spruce (Picea rubens)
White spruce (Picea glauca)
Jack pine (Pinus banksiana)
Balsam fir (Abies balsamea)

Shockwave cosmology,"Shockwave cosmology is a non-standard cosmology proposed by Joel Smoller and Blake Temple in 2003. In this model, the “big bang” is an explosion inside a black hole, producing the expanding volume of space and matter that includes the observable universe.


== Integration with general relativity ==
Smoller and Temple integrate shock waves into Einstein's general relativity. This produces a universe that ""looks essentially identical to the aftermath of the big bang"" according to cosmologists Barnes and Lewis. They explain that Smoller and Temple's version is distinguished from the big bang only by there being a shockwave at the leading edge of an explosion - one that, for Smoller and Temple's model, must be beyond the observable universe. However, Barnes and Lewis do not support shockwave cosmology because they see it as not testable; they point out that there is no explosion in the standard theory of the Big Bang.


== Current and future state of the universe ==
From Smoller and Temple's calculations, we are still inside an expanding black hole. The configuration of 'flat' spacetime (see Minkowski space) inside a black hole, also occurs during the moments of the formation of a black hole from a collapsing star.
Eventually, according to shockwave cosmology, the mass of our expanding volume of space and matter will fall in density as it expands. At some point, the event horizon of the black hole will cease to be. An outside observer will then see it appear as a white hole. The matter would then continue to expand.


== Alternative to dark energy ==
In related work, Smoller, Temple, and Vogler propose that this shockwave may have resulted in our part of the universe having a lower density than that surrounding it, causing the accelerated expansion normally attributed to dark energy.  
They also propose that this related theory could be tested: a universe with dark energy should give a figure for the cubic correction to redshift versus luminosity C = −0.180 at a = a whereas for Smoller, Temple, and Vogler's alternative C should be positive rather than negative. They give a more precise calculation for their wave model alternative as: the cubic correction to redshift versus luminosity at a = a is C = 0.359. 


== Comparison with standard cosmology ==
Although shockwave cosmology produces a universe that ""looks essentially identical to the aftermath of the big bang"", cosmologists consider that it needs further development before it could be considered as a more advantageous model than the big bang theory (or standard model) in explaining the universe. In particular it would need to explain big bang nucleosynthesis, the quantitative details of the microwave background anisotropies, the Lyman-alpha forest, and galaxy surveys.

K Foundation Burn a Million Quid,"K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was a work of performance art executed and filmed on 23 August 1994 in which the K Foundation, an art duo consisting of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, burned £1 million (equivalent to £2.5 million in 2023) in the back of a disused boathouse on the Ardfin Estate on the Scottish island of Jura. The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds that had been previously earned by Drummond and Cauty as the KLF.
The event was recorded on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. On the one year anniversary of the burning, 23 August 1995, the film was released as Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid and was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging audiences in debates about the burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning for a period of 23 years; Drummond subsequently made the decision to discreetly speak about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted that he regretted burning the money. The self-imposed moratorium officially ended on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning, when Cauty and Drummond hosted a debate asking ""Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?"" during their ""Welcome to the Dark Ages"" event.
Collaborator Chris Brook edited and compiled a book, K Foundation Burn A Million Quid, which was published by Ellipsis Books in 1997. It compiles stills from the film, accounts of events and viewer reactions, and an image of the brick that was manufactured from the fire's ashes. A film consisting of a static three-minute shot of the brick, ""This Brick"", was shown at London's Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K in the same year.


== Background ==
As The KLF, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991. They had also enjoyed considerable success with their album The White Room and a number one hit single – ""Doctorin' the Tardis"" – as The Timelords. In February 1992, The KLF staged an incendiary performance at the BRIT Awards, and retired from the music industry shortly thereafter in typically enigmatic fashion.

By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian Big Issue writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the royalties they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds: I think we made about £6m. We paid nearly half that in tax and spent the rest on production costs. When we stopped, the production costs stopped too, so over the next few months we amassed a surplus of cash still coming in from record sales; this amounted to about £1.8m. After tax we were left with about £1m. This was the money that later became the K Foundation fund for the 'advancement of kreation.'
Initially The KLF's earnings were to be distributed by way of a fund for struggling artists managed by the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty's new post-KLF art project, but, said Drummond, ""We realised that struggling artists are meant to struggle, that's the whole point."" Instead the duo decided to create art with the money. Nailed to the Wall was the first piece of art produced by the Foundation, and the major piece in their planned art exhibition, Money: A Major Body of Cash. Consisting of one million pounds in cash nailed to a pine frame, the piece was presented to the press on 23 November 1993 during the buildup to the Foundation's announcement of the ""winner"" of their ""worst artist of the year award"", the K Foundation art award.


== Decision and burning ==
During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. ""'The Tate, in Liverpool, wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from [...] the gallery curator informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly"", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. ""Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do."" Cauty: ""We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare.""
The journey from deciding to burn the money to deciding how to burn the money to actually burning the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering Nailed to the Wall to the Tate Gallery as the ""1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation."" The condition was that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, the money would be burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside Power Station, ""the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the South Bank"", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF 'guerrilla communication' style, ""posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation', under which would have been an image of Nailed to the Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt.""

The K Foundation's ultimate resolution for their one-million-pound ""problem"" was rather less showbiz, but dramatic nonetheless, the Foundation having decided that making a public spectacle of the event would lessen its impact. On 22 August, Reid, Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo touched down at Islay Airport in the Inner Hebrides and took a ferry to the island of Jura, previously the scene of a wicker man burning ceremony by The KLF. Early in the morning of 23 August 1994, in an abandoned boathouse on Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated the money. The burning was witnessed by Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the act for The Observer, and it was filmed on a Hi-8 video camera by collaborator Gimpo. As the burning began Reid said he felt guilt and shock. These feelings, he reported, quickly turned to boredom.
The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. According to Drummond, only about £900,000 of the money was actually burnt, with the remainder flying straight up the chimney. Two days later, according to Reid, Jimmy Cauty destroyed all film and photographic evidence of the burning. Ten months later, Gimpo revealed to them that he had secretly kept a copy.


== Film ==
Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid starts with a short description of the event, and then consists of Drummond and Cauty throwing £50 notes onto the fire. Burning the entire amount takes around 67 minutes. NME wrote: At the start, Cauty is agitated and says he doesn't think the money will burn because it is too wet. The camera shows 20 thick bundles of £50 notes, each bundle containing £50,000 in new bank notes and sealed in cellophane. When the money ignites, Drummond starts to laugh as he and Cauty stand above a small fireplace throwing £50 notes on to the fire. Cauty constantly stokes the blaze with a large wooden plank and at one stage burns his hand on a flaming note. As the fire starts to dim, he scuttles around the floor sweeping stray notes into the flames. The cameraman shows a view from outside the building with charred £50 notes billowing out of the chimney.
In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the Omnibus documentary series about The K Foundation entitled A Foundation Course in Art (usually mislabelled as The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid online). Amongst the footage broadcast were scenes from Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. Thomas Sutcliffe, reviewing the programme in The Independent, wrote:The Omnibus film about this intriguing pair was in part a rear-guard action in their continuing battle for recognition (and a victory – for some people, after all, art is what appears on Omnibus). It was also a peculiarly modern fable about what constitutes an artist – will the artist's say-so do, or do you need the validation of the galleries? ""You can't simply decide you're going to become an artist,"" said one gallery owner haughtily, which left you wondering how else the vocation might operate. A lottery system? Secret-ballot election?
For my money (meagre though it is), the video which recorded the laborious process of immolation was a decidedly intriguing work – rather more provoking than some contemporary work I've seen. For established galleries, the medium used (video, bank-notes, fire) is obviously an embarrassment, but if poverty of material is not to disqualify artworks (bricks or lard, say) why should the expense of material?


=== Screening tour ===
The first public screening of Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was on Jura on 23 August 1995 – exactly one year after the burning. ""We feel we should face them and answer their questions"" said one of the duo. Two weeks later an advert appeared in The Guardian, announcing a world tour of the film over the next 12 months at ""relevant locations"". The second screening was at In the City music industry convention on 5 September in Manchester. After the film was shown, Drummond and Cauty held a question-and-answer session with the theme ""Is It Rock'n'Roll?"". A week later, the pair travelled as guests of alternative radio station B92 to Belgrade, where the post-screening discussion was titled ""Is it a crime against humanity?"" An unauthorised screening at the BBC Television Centre was curtailed and Drummond and Cauty were escorted from the building.
On the weekend of 3 November 1995, the film was screened at several locations in Glasgow, including at football matches involving Celtic and Rangers; a planned screening at Barlinnie prison was cancelled after the Scottish Prison Service withdrew permission. Glasgow's artistic community broadly seemed to welcome the screenings. A further public screening on Glasgow Green on 5 November was announced by various newspapers, but there is no record of the showing having ever occurred. The K Foundation disappeared from Glasgow; they later issued a statement that on 5 November 1995 they had signed a ""contract"" on the side of a Nissan Bluebird - which had then been pushed over the cliffs at Cape Wrath in northern Scotland - agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years.
Despite the K Foundation's reported moratorium, further national screenings of the film organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening, Drummond and Cauty announced they would not answer questions after the film; instead, they would ask questions of the audience. These screenings were held in Bradford, Hull, Liverpool, Jamaica Street Studios, Cheltenham Ladies College, Eton College, Aberystwyth, Glastonbury Tor, Alan Moore's front room and Brick Lane, London.
The Brick Lane screening – on 8 December 1995 – had been previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned for a car park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to the basement of the nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.


== End of the moratorium ==
Drummond and Cauty ended their self-imposed moratorium on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning. ""Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?"" was debated during ""Welcome to the Dark Ages"", a three-day festival celebrating the launch of their novel 2023: A Trilogy.


== Burning as a theme ==

Ritualistic burnings had already been a recurring aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut album—The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)—by burning them in a Swedish field. This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and celebrated in the song ""Burn the Bastards"". During the 1991 summer solstice, they burnt a 60 feet (18 m) wicker man on Jura, as chronicled in the KLF movie The Rites of Mu.
As the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty threatened to burn the K Foundation art award prize money (Gimpo was fumbling with matches and lighter fluid when, at the last moment, Rachel Whiteread accepted the prize). In the seventh K Foundation press advert they asked ""What would you do with a million pounds? Burn it?""


== Reaction and analysis ==
Jim Reid's piece appeared in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is ""one of the most peculiar stories of the year"", he cautioned readers. ""Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going to have trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth."" ""It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames"", he added. ""I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this.""
The Daily Express ran the story on 1 October 1994. They reported that charred £50 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had really taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.
The Times followed with essentially the same story on 4 October 1994, adding that the burning ""[had] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and angry"". £1,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to Islay police: ""Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with Customs and Excise, who pronounced it genuine. 'I telephoned Mr Drummond in London and told him the money had been found. I asked him if it was his. He said he would get in touch with his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not telephoned back'"".
The media returned to the story in earnest in October and November 1995, previewing and then reviewing Foundation Course in Art, and reporting on the K Foundation's tour screening Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid.
An October 1995 feature quoted Kevin Hull, the BBC documentary maker responsible for the Omnibus item, saying he had found ""the boys rather depressed, and almost in a state of shock"". ""Every day I wake up and I think 'Oh God, I've burnt a million quid and everyone thinks it's wrong'"", Cauty told him.
A piece in The Times on 5 November 1995, coinciding with the Glasgow screenings, reported that the K Foundation had no solid reason for burning the money or view of what, if anything, the act represented, but concluded ""The K Foundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly provoked thousands to question and analyse the power of money and the responsibilities of those who possess it. And what could be more artistic than that?"" In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all ""entertaining, and satirically quite sharp"", but ""the art world has chosen not to think [of it as art].... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original. Although they didn't blow their entire life's savings along the way, other artists, notably Yves Klein and Chris Burden, have been here before.""
The Guardian's TV reviewer was sceptical. ""Snag is, the K men have always dealt in myth and sown a trail of confusion, so nobody quite believes they really burned the money. And if they did, they must be nuts.""


=== Later reaction ===
In the following years, the burning was mentioned regularly in the press, with Drummond and Cauty often relegated to a cultural status of ""the men who burnt a million quid"".
A February 2000 article in The Observer newspaper again insisted that the duo really had burnt one million pounds. ""It wasn't a stunt. They really did it. If you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. 'I knew it was real,' a long-time friend and associate of his group The KLF tells me, 'because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be honest, they've never really been the same since'"".
A 2004 listener poll by BBC Radio 6 Music saw The KLF/K Foundation placed second after The Who in a list of ""rock excesses"".
Drummond's former protégé Julian Cope was unimpressed, claiming that Drummond still owed him money. ""He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry-wank stunts like that.""


== Legacy ==
On 17 September 1997, a new film, This Brick, was premiered. The film consisted of one three-minute shot of a brick made from the ashes of the money burnt at Jura. It was shown at the Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K.
On 27 September 1997, K Foundation Burn A Million Quid (ISBN 0-9541656-5-9, ISBN 1-899858-37-7 paperback) was published. The book, by Chris Brook and Gimpo, contains stills from the film and transcriptions of various Q&A sessions from the tour. It also includes a timeline of K Foundation activity and sundry essays including one from Alan Moore. Publisher Ellipsis promoted the book with an advert modelled on those of the K Foundation – ""Why did Ellipsis publish K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?"" they asked.
Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling The Observer in 2000 that he couldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless his child was ill and only ""an expensive clinic"" could cure him. By 2004, however, he had admitted to the BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. ""It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand.""

Curly birch,"Curly birch (Betula pendula var. carelica) is a variant of the plant species silver birch (also known as warty birch, European white birch, or East Asian white birch) with a genetic defect that causes the tree to twist on the stem with curls. The annual rings are oriented incorrectly, which gives the wood a fiery appearance. The variant originally comes from Karelia in Finland and Russia. The curliness is passed on in up to 70% of all trees in the next generation. Common spring birch is also sometimes referred to as masonry birch, but one should only use that term for trees that have the real curliness.


== The wood ==
The annual rings are wavelike and irregular, with brown curly-grained wood tissue cells often exhibiting a V pattern in the cross-sectional view. If this pattern continues evenly across the entire surface, the result is a starlike pattern (a.k.a. curly-grain blossom). The longitudinal section of the stem exhibits lenslike patterns. The wood of curly birch is dense and very heavy, when freshly felled it can rise to 930 kg/m3, and at 12% moisture approx. 700-730 kg/m3. Curly birch exhibits some exceptional leaf forms, but these cannot be used as certain identifiers. The irregular bud formation connected to curly-grainedness results in abundant branching and bushy habit among curly birches.
Curly birch wood is used for furniture, knife shafts, and in woodturning for bowls and pens.


== Distribution ==
The curly birch is found naturally only in Europe and only in small separate areas. In Finland, it occurs naturally in Southern Finland up to the latitude of Jyväskylä, and especially in former swidden areas. In the other Nordic countries, curly birch occurs in parts of southern Sweden and in the most south-easterly parts of Norway. In addition to the above, curly birch is to be found in the Russia (Karelia, Ingria, and some other western areas), in the Baltic countries, and in Belarus. There also are scattered stands of curly birch in Central Europe. However, curly birch is most abundant in Finland and in the Karelia region of Russia.

Macaulay's method(The double integration method) is a technique used in structural analysis to determine the deflection of Euler-Bernoulli beams. Use of Macaulay's technique is very convenient for cases of discontinuous and/or discrete loading. Typically partial uniformly distributed loads (u.d.l.) and uniformly varying loads (u.v.l.) over the span and a number of concentrated loads are conveniently handled using this technique.
Mach numberThe ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound. 
MachineA machine (or mechanical device) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action. Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems.
Machine codeIn computer programming, machine code, consisting of machine language instructions, is a low-level programming language used to directly control a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.
Machine elementor hardware, refers to an elementary component of a machine.  These elements consist of three basic types:
structural components such as frame members, bearings, axles, splines, fasteners, seals, and lubricants,
mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches, and
control components such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers.

While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.

Machine elements are basic mechanical parts and features used as the building blocks of most machines. Most are standardized to common sizes, but customs are also common for specialized applications.
Machine learning(ML), is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
Maclaurin seriesIn mathematics, the Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor's series are named after Brook Taylor,  who introduced them in 1715.  If zero is the point where the derivatives are considered, a Taylor series is also called a Maclaurin series, after Colin Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.
Magnetic fieldA magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents,: ch1  and magnetic materials. A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field.: ch13   A permanent magnet's magnetic field pulls on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets.  In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location will exert a force on a range of non-magnetic materials by affecting the motion of their outer atomic electrons. Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, and are created by electric currents such as those used in electromagnets, and by electric fields varying in time.  Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, they are described as a map assigning a vector to each point of space or, more precisely—because of the way the magnetic field transforms under mirror reflection—as a field of pseudovectors.

In electromagnetics, the term ""magnetic field"" is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols B and H. In the International System of Units, H, magnetic field strength, is measured in the SI base units of ampere per meter (A/m). B, magnetic flux density, is measured in tesla (in SI base units: kilogram per second2 per ampere), which is equivalent to newton per meter per ampere. H and B differ in how they account for magnetization. In vacuum, the two fields are related through the vacuum permeability,

; but in a magnetized material, the terms differ by the material's magnetization at each point.
Magnetismis a class of physical attributes that are mediated by magnetic fields. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomenon of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves.  Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible.  Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.
Manufacturing engineeringis a branch of professional engineering that shares many common concepts and ideas with other fields of engineering such as mechanical, chemical, electrical, and industrial engineering. 
Manufacturing engineering requires the ability to plan the practices of manufacturing; to research and to develop tools, processes, machines and equipment; and to integrate the facilities and systems for producing quality products with the optimum expenditure of capital.

The manufacturing or production engineer's primary focus is to turn raw material into an updated or new product in the most effective, efficient & economic way possible.
Mass balanceA mass balance, also called a material balance, is an application of conservation of mass to the analysis of physical systems. By accounting for material entering and leaving a system, mass flows can be identified which might have been unknown, or difficult to measure without this technique.  The exact conservation law used in the analysis of the system depends on the context of the problem, but all revolve around mass conservation, i.e., that matter cannot disappear or be created spontaneously.: 59–62 
Mass densityThe density (more precisely, the volumetric mass density; also known as specific mass), of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:

  
    
      
        ρ
        =
        
          
            m
            V
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}}
  

where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight.
Mass moment of inertiaThe moment of inertia, otherwise known as the mass moment of inertia, angular mass, second moment of mass, or most accurately, rotational inertia, of a rigid body is a quantity that determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration about a rotational axis, akin to how mass determines the force needed for a desired acceleration. It depends on the body's mass distribution and the axis chosen, with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body's rate of rotation.
Mass numberThe mass number (symbol A, from the German word Atomgewicht [atomic weight]), also called  atomic mass number or nucleon number, is the total number of protons and neutrons (together known as nucleons) in an atomic nucleus. It is approximately equal to the atomic (also known as isotopic) mass of the atom expressed in atomic mass units. Since protons and neutrons are both baryons, the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B of the nucleus (and also of the whole atom or ion). The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element. Hence, the difference between the mass number and the atomic number Z gives the number of neutrons (N) in a given nucleus: N = A − Z.

The mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, the most common isotope of carbon is carbon-12, or 12C, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number (Z) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number: 126C.
Mass spectrometry(MS), is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of  ions. The results are typically presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.
Material failure theoryis an interdisciplinary field of materials science and solid mechanics which attempts to predict the conditions under which solid materials fail under the action of external loads. The failure of a material is usually classified into brittle failure (fracture) or ductile failure (yield). Depending on the conditions (such as temperature, state of stress, loading rate) most materials can fail in a brittle or ductile manner or both. However, for most practical situations, a material may be classified as either brittle or ductile.

In mathematical terms, failure theory is expressed in the form of various failure criteria which are valid for specific materials.  Failure criteria are functions in stress or strain space which separate ""failed"" states from ""unfailed"" states.  A precise physical definition of a ""failed"" state is not easily quantified and several working definitions are in use in the engineering community.  Quite often, phenomenological failure criteria of the same form are used to predict brittle failure and ductile yields.
Material propertiesA material's property is an intensive property of some material, i.e., a physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material. These quantitative properties may be used as a metric by which the benefits of one material versus another can be compared, thereby aiding in materials selection.
Materials scienceThe interdisciplinary field of materials science, also commonly termed materials science and engineering, covers the design and discovery of new materials, particularly solids. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools for its study.

Materials scientists emphasize understanding, how the history of a material (processing) influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the materials paradigm. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including nanotechnology, biomaterials, and metallurgy.

Materials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis –  investigating materials, products, structures or components, which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various aviation accidents and incidents.
Mathematical optimizationMathematical optimization (alternatively spelled optimisation) or mathematical programming is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives. Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.

In the simplest case, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics. More generally, optimization includes finding ""best available"" values of some objective function given a defined domain (or input), including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains.
Mathematical physicsrefers to the development of mathematical methods for application to problems in physics. The Journal of Mathematical Physics defines the field as ""the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories"".
Mathematicsincludes the study of such topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change (analysis). It has no generally accepted definition.

Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
MatrixIn mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object. For example, 

  
    
      
        
          
            [
            
              
                
                  1
                
                
                  9
                
                
                  −
                  13
                
              
              
                
                  20
                
                
                  5
                
                
                  −
                  6
                
              
            
            ]
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}1&9&-13\\20&5&-6\end{bmatrix}}}
  

is a matrix with two rows and three columns; one say often a ""two by three matrix"", a ""2×3-matrix"", or a matrix of dimension 2×3.

Without further specifications, matrices represent linear maps, and allow explicit computations in linear algebra. Therefore, the study of matrices is a large part of linear algebra, and most properties and operations of abstract linear algebra can be expressed in terms of matrices. For example, matrix multiplication represents composition of linear maps.

Not all matrices are related to linear algebra. This is in particular the case, in graph theory, of incidence matrices and adjacency matrices.
MatterIn classical physics and general chemistry, matter is any substance that has mass and takes up space by having volume. All everyday objects that can be touched are ultimately composed of atoms, which are made up of interacting subatomic particles, and in everyday as well as scientific usage, ""matter"" generally includes atoms and anything made up of them, and any particles (or combination of particles) that act as if they have both rest mass and volume. However it does not include massless particles such as photons, or other energy phenomena or waves such as light.: 21  Matter exists in various states (also known as phases). These include classical everyday phases such as solid, liquid, and gas – for example water exists as ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam – but other states are possible, including plasma, Bose–Einstein condensates, fermionic condensates, and quark–gluon plasma.
Maximum-distortion energy theory.
Maximum-normal-stress theory.
Maximum shear stress.
Maxwell's equationsare a set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits. 
The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, wireless communication, lenses, radar etc. They describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of the fields. The equations are named after the physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who, in 1861 and 1862, published an early form of the equations that included the Lorentz force law. Maxwell first used the equations to propose that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon.

An important consequence of Maxwell's equations is that they demonstrate how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at a constant speed (c) in vacuum. Known as electromagnetic radiation, these waves may occur at various wavelengths to produce a spectrum of light from radio waves to gamma rays. 
MeanThere are several kinds of mean in mathematics, especially in statistics:

For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also known as average or arithmetic average, is a central value of a finite set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}
  
. If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is the sample mean (denoted 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}
  
) to distinguish it from the mean, or expected value, of the underlying distribution, the population mean (denoted 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  
 or 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{x}}
  
).

In probability and statistics, the population mean, or expected value, is a measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of a random variable characterized by that distribution. In a discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability p(x), and then adding all these products together, giving 
  
    
      
        μ
        =
        ∑
        x
        p
        (
        x
        )
        .
        .
        .
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu =\sum xp(x)....}
  
. An analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution. Not every probability distribution has a defined mean (see the Cauchy distribution for an example). Moreover, the mean can be infinite for some distributions.

For a finite population, the population mean of a property is equal to the arithmetic mean of the given property, while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height is equal to the sum of the heights of every individual—divided by the total number of individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers states that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.

Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in geometry and mathematical analysis.
Measure of central tendencyIn statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central or typical value for a probability distribution. It may also be called a center or location of the distribution. Colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called averages. The term central tendency dates from the late 1920s.

The most common measures of central tendency are the arithmetic mean, the median, and the mode.  A middle tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution, such as the normal distribution. Occasionally authors use central tendency to denote ""the tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value.""

The central tendency of a distribution is typically contrasted with its dispersion or variability; dispersion and central tendency are the often characterized properties of distributions. Analysis may judge whether data has a strong or a weak central tendency based on its dispersion.
Mechanical advantageis a measure of the force amplification achieved by using a tool, mechanical device or machine system. The device trades off input forces against movement to obtain a desired amplification in the output force.  The model for this is the law of the lever.  Machine components designed to manage forces and movement in this way are called mechanisms.  
An ideal mechanism transmits power without adding to or subtracting from it.  This means the ideal mechanism does not include a power source, is frictionless, and is constructed from rigid bodies that do not deflect or wear.  The performance of a real system relative to this ideal is expressed in terms of efficiency factors that take into account departures from the ideal.
Mechanical engineeringis an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.
Mechanical filteris a signal processing filter usually used in place of an electronic filter at radio frequencies.  Its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter: to pass a range of signal frequencies, but to block others.  The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal.  At the input and output of the filter, transducers convert the electrical signal into, and then back from, these mechanical vibrations.
Mechanical waveis a wave that is an oscillation of matter, and therefore transfers energy through a medium. While waves can move over long distances, the movement of the medium of transmission—the material—is limited. Therefore, the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position. Mechanical waves transport energy. This energy propagates in the same direction as the wave. Any kind of wave (mechanical or electromagnetic) has a certain energy. Mechanical waves can be produced only in media which possess elasticity and inertia.
Mechanicsis the area of physics concerned with the motions of physical objects, more specifically the relationships among force, matter, and motion. Forces applied to objects result in displacements, or changes of an object's position relative to its environment.
This branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece with the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics.
It is a branch of classical physics that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 
It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm. The field is today less widely understood in terms of quantum theory.
Mechanismis a device that transforms input forces and movement into a desired set of output forces and movement. Mechanisms generally consist of moving components which may include:
Gears and gear trains
Belts and chain drives
Cams and followers
Linkages
Friction devices, such as brakes or clutches
Structural components such as a frame, fasteners, bearings, springs, or lubricants
Various machine elements, such as splines, pins, or keys
MedianIn statistics and probability theory, the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as ""the middle"" value. The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the ""average"") is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and therefore provides a better representation of a ""typical"" value. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a ""typical"" income is, because income distribution can be very skewed. The median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median is not an arbitrarily large or small result.
MeltingMelting, or fusion, is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid. This occurs when the internal energy of the solid increases, typically by the application of heat or pressure, which increases the substance's temperature to the melting point. At the melting point, the ordering of ions or molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state, and the solid melts to become a liquid.
Melting pointThe melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.

When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the ""characteristic freezing point"" of a substance is determined, in fact the actual methodology is almost always ""the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.""
MesonIn particle physics, mesons are hadronic subatomic particles composed of an equal number of quarks and antiquarks, usually one of each, bound together by strong interactions. Because mesons are composed of quark subparticles, they have a meaningful physical size, a diameter of roughly one femtometer (1×10−15 m), which is about 0.6 times the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond.  Heavier mesons decay to lighter mesons and ultimately to stable electrons, neutrinos and photons.
Metallic bondingis a type of chemical bonding that arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons (in the form of an electron cloud of delocalized electrons) and positively charged metal ions. It may be described as the sharing of free electrons among a structure of positively charged ions (cations). Metallic bonding accounts for many physical properties of metals, such as strength, ductility, thermal and electrical resistivity and conductivity, opacity, and luster.

Metallic bonding is not the only type of chemical bonding a metal can exhibit, even as a pure substance. For example, elemental gallium consists of covalently-bound pairs of atoms in both liquid and solid-state—these pairs form a crystal structure with metallic bonding between them. Another example of a metal–metal covalent bond is the mercurous ion (Hg2+2).
Middle-out A combination of top-down and bottom-up design.
Mid-rangeIn statistics, the mid-range or mid-extreme is a measure of central tendency of a sample (statistics) defined as the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum values of the data set:

  
    
      
        M
        =
        
          
            
              max
              x
              +
              min
              x
            
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle M={\frac {\max x+\min x}{2}}.}
  

The mid-range is closely related to the range, a measure of statistical dispersion defined as the difference between maximum and minimum values.
The two measures are complementary in sense that if one knows the mid-range and the range, one can find the sample maximum and minimum values.

The mid-range is rarely used in practical statistical analysis, as it lacks efficiency as an estimator for most distributions of interest,  because it ignores all intermediate points, and lacks robustness, as outliers change it significantly. Indeed, it is one of the least efficient and least robust statistics. However, it finds some use in special cases: it is the maximally efficient estimator for the center of a uniform distribution, trimmed mid-ranges address robustness, and as an L-estimator, it is simple to understand and compute.
MidhingeIn statistics, the midhinge is the average of the first and third quartiles and is thus a measure of location.
Equivalently, it is the 25% trimmed mid-range or 25% midsummary; it is an L-estimator.

Cubist sculpture,"Cubist sculpture developed in parallel with Cubist painting, beginning in Paris around 1909 with its proto-Cubist phase, and evolving through the early 1920s. Just as Cubist painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids; cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones. Presenting fragments and facets of objects that could be visually interpreted in different ways had the effect of 'revealing the structure' of the object. Cubist sculpture essentially is the dynamic rendering of three-dimensional objects in the language of non-Euclidean geometry by shifting viewpoints of volume or mass in terms of spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces.


== History ==

In the historical analysis of most modern movements such as Cubism there has been a tendency to suggest that sculpture trailed behind painting. Writings about individual sculptors within the Cubist movement are commonly found, while writings about Cubist sculpture are premised on painting, offering sculpture nothing more than a supporting role.
We are better advised, writes Penelope Curtis, ""to look at what is sculptural within Cubism. Cubist painting is an almost sculptural translation of the external world; its associated sculpture translates Cubist painting back into a semi-reality"". Attempts to separate painting and sculpture, even by 1910, are very difficult. ""If painters used sculpture for their own ends, so sculptors exploited the new freedom too"", writes Curtis, ""and we should look at what sculptors took from the discourse of painting and why. In the longer term we could read such developments as the beginning of a process in which sculpture expands, poaching painting's territory and then others, to become steadily more prominent in this century"".
Increasingly, painters claim sculptural means of problem solving for their paintings. Braque's paper sculptures of 1911, for example, were intended to clarify and enrich his pictorial idiom. ""This has meant"" according to Curtis, ""that we have tended to see sculpture through painting, and even to see painters as poaching sculpture. This is largely because we read Gauguin, Degas, Matisse, and Picasso as painters even when looking at their sculpture, but also because their sculptures often deserve to be spoken of as much as paintings as sculptures"".

A painting is meant both to capture the palpable three-dimensionality of the world revealed to the retina, and to draw attention to itself as a two-dimensional object, so that it is both a depiction and an object in itself. Such is the case for Picasso's 1909-10 Head of a Woman (Head of Fernande), often considered the first Cubist sculpture. Yet Head of a Woman, writes Curtis, ""had mainly revealed how Cubism was more interesting in Painting—where it showed in two dimensions how to represent three dimensions—than in sculpture"". Picasso's Head of a Woman was less adventurous than his painting of 1909 and subsequent years.
Though it is difficult to define what can properly be called a 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 Head bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at sharp angles, rendering practically unreadable the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets are obviously a translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.
According to the art historian Douglas Cooper, ""The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive Woman's Head, modeled in 1909-10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time.""
It has been suggested that in contrast to Cubist painters, Cubist sculptors did not create a new art of 'space-time'. Unlike a flat painting, high-relief sculpture from its volumetric nature could never be limited to a single view-point. Hence, as Peter Collins highlights, it is absurd to state that Cubist sculpture, like painting, was not limited to a single point of view.
The concept of Cubist sculpture may seem ""paradoxical"", writes George Heard Hamilton, ""because the fundamental Cubist situation was the representation on a two-dimensional surface of a multi-dimensional space at least theoretically impossible to see or to represent in the three dimensions of actual space, the temptation to move from a pictorial diagram to its spatial realization proved irresistible"".

Now liberated from the one-to-one relationship between a fixed coordinate in space captured at a single moment in time assumed by classical vanishing-point perspective, the Cubist sculptor, just as the painter, became free to explore notions of simultaneity, whereby several positions in space captured at successive time intervals could be depicted within the bounds of a single three-dimensional work of art.
Of course, 'simultaneity' and 'multiple perspective' were not the only characteristics of Cubism. In Du ""Cubisme"" the painters Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger write:

""Some, and they are not the least intelligent, see the aim of our technique in the exclusive study of volumes. If they were to add that it suffices, surfaces being the limits of volumes and lines those of surfaces, to imitate a contour in order to represent a volume, we might agree with them; but they are thinking only of the sensation of relief, which we hold to be insufficient. We are neither geometers nor sculptors: for us lines, surfaces, and volumes are only modifications of the notion of fullness. To imitate volumes only would be to deny these modifications for the benefit of a monotonous intensity. As well renounce at once our desire for variety. Between reliefs indicated sculpturally we must contrive to hint at those lesser features which are suggested but not defined.""

More astonishing still, writes John Adkins Richardson, ""is the fact that the artists participating in the [Cubist] movement not only created a revolution, they surpassed it, going on to create other styles of an incredible range and dissimilarity, and even devised new forms and techniques in sculpture and ceramic arts"".
""Cubists sculpture"", writes Douglas Cooper, ""must be discussed apart from the painting because it followed other paths, which were sometimes similar but never parallel"".
""But not infrequently the sculptor and the painter upset the equilibrium of the work of others by doing things which are out of key or out of proportion."" (Arthur Jerome Eddy)
The use of diverging vantage-points for representing the features of objects or subject matter became a central factor in the practice of all Cubists, leading to the assertion, as noted by the art historian Christopher Green, ""that Cubist art was essentially conceptual rather than perceptual"". Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes in their 1912 writing, along with the writings by the critic Maurice Raynal, were most responsible for the emphasis given to this claim. Raynal argued, echoing Metzinger and Gleizes, that the rejection of classical perspective in favor of multiplicity represented a break with the 'instantaneity' that characterized Impressionism. The mind now directed the optical exploration of the world. Painting and sculpture no longer merely recorded sensations generated through the eye; but resulted from the intelligence of both artist and observer. This was a mobile and dynamic investigation that explored multiple facets of the world.


== Proto-Cubist sculpture ==

The origins of Cubist sculpture are as diverse as the origins of Cubist painting, resulting from a wide range of influences, experiments and circumstances, rather than from one source. With its roots stemming as far back as ancient Egypt, Greece and Africa, the proto-Cubist period (englobing both painting and sculpture) is characterized by the geometrization of form. It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase, in three-dimensional form, of an art movement known from the spring of 1911 as Cubism.
The influences that characterize the transition from classical to modern sculpture range from diverse artistic movements (Post-Impressionism, Symbolism, Les Nabis and Neo-Impressionism), to the works of individual artists such as Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol, Antoine Bourdelle, Charles Despiau, Constantin Meunier, Edgar Degas, Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat and Paul Gauguin (among others), to African art, Egyptian art, Ancient Greek art, Oceanic art, Native American art, and Iberian schematic art.
Before the advent of Cubism artists had questioned the treatment of form inherent in art since the Renaissance. Eugène Delacroix the romanticist, Gustave Courbet the realist, and virtually all the Impressionists had jettisoned Classicism in favor of immediate sensation. The dynamic expression favored by these artists presented a challenge to the static traditional means of expression.
In his 1914 Cubists and Post-Impressionism Arthur Jerome Eddy makes reference to Auguste Rodin and his relation to both Post-Impressionism and Cubism:

The truth is there is more of Cubism in great painting than we dream, and the extravagances of the Cubists may serve to open our eyes to beauties we have always felt without quite understanding.
Take, for instance, the strongest things by Winslow Homer; the strength lies in the big, elemental manner in which the artist rendered his impressions in lines and masses which departed widely from photographic reproductions of scenes and people.
Rodin's bronzes exhibit these same elemental qualities, qualities which are pushed to violent extremes in Cubist sculpture. But may it not be profoundly true that these very extremes, these very extravagances, by causing us to blink and rub our eyes, end in a finer understanding and appreciation of such work as Rodin's?

His Balzac is, in a profound sense, his most colossal work, and at the same time his most elemental. In its simplicity, in its use of planes and masses, it is—one might say, solely for purposes of illustration—Cubist, with none of the extravagances of Cubism. It is purely Post-Impressionistic.

Several factors mobilized the shift from a representational art form to one increasingly abstract; a most important factor would be found in the works of Paul Cézanne, and his interpretation of nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, and the cone. In addition to his tendency to simplify geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with rendering the effect of volume and space. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the complex treatment of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a planar faceting effect. In his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, with larger, bolder, more arbitrary faceting, with dynamic and increasingly abstract results. As the colors planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.
Avant-garde artists working in Paris had begun reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Cézanne following a retrospective of his paintings at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, and exhibitions of his work at the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. The influence generated by the work of Cézanne, in combination with the impact of diverse cultures, suggests a means by which artists (including Alexander Archipenko, Constantin Brâncuși, Georges Braque, Joseph Csaky, Robert Delaunay, Henri le Fauconnier, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Jean Metzinger, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso) made the transition to diverse forms of Cubism.
Yet the extreme to which the Cubist painters and sculptors exaggerated the distortions created by the use of multiple perspective and the depiction of forms in terms of planes is the late work of Paul Cézanne, led to a fundamental change in the formal strategy and relationship between artist and subject not anticipated by Cézanne.


=== Africa, Egyptian, Greek and Iberian art ===

Another factor in the shift towards abstraction was the increasing exposure to Prehistoric art, and art produced by various cultures: African art, Cycladic art, Oceanic art, Art of the Americas, the Art of ancient Egypt, Iberian sculpture, and Iberian schematic art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, André Derain, Henri Rousseau and Pablo Picasso were inspired by the stark power and stylistic simplicity of artworks produced by these cultures.
Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through Gertrude Stein, at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in Tribal art, Iberian sculpture and African tribal masks. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of ethnographic art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as proto-Cubism, as Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, the antecedent of Cubism.

The African influence, which introduced anatomical simplifications, along with expressive features reminiscent of El Greco, are the generally assumed starting point for the Proto-Cubism of Picasso. He began working on studies for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. But that wasn't all. Aside from further influences of the Symbolists, Pierre Daix explored Picasso's Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of Claude Lévi-Strauss on the subject of myth. And too, without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso's proto-Cubism came not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers of the psyche.
European artists (and art collectors) prized objects from different cultures for their stylistic traits defined as attributes of primitive expression: absence of classical perspective, simple outlines and shapes, presence of symbolic signs including the hieroglyph, emotive figural distortions, and the dynamic rhythms generated by repetitive ornamental patterns.
These were the profound energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceana, the Americas, that attracted not just Picasso, but many of the Parisian avant-garde that transited through a proto-Cubist phase. While some delved deeper into the problems of geometric abstraction, becoming known as Cubists, others such as Derain and Matisse chose different paths. And others still such as Brâncuși and Modigliani exhibited with the Cubists yet defied classification as Cubists.
In The Rise if Cubism Daniel Henry Kahnweiler writes of the similarities between African art with Cubist painting and sculpture:

In the years 1913 and 1914 Braque and Picasso attempted to eliminate the use of color as chiaroscuro, which had still persisted to some extent in their painting, by amalgamating painting and sculpture. Instead of having to demonstrate through shadows how one plane stands above, or in front of a second plane, they could now superimpose the planes one on the other and illustrate the relationship directly. The first attempts to do this go far back. Picasso had already begun such an enterprise in 1909, but since he did it within the limits of closed form, it was destined to fail. It resulted in a kind of colored bas-relief. Only in open planal form could this union of painting and sculpture be realized. Despite current prejudice, this endeavor to increase plastic expression through the collaboration of the two arts must be warmly approved; an enrichment of the plastic arts is certain to result from it. A number of sculptors like Lipchitz, Laurens and Archipenko have since taken up and developed this sculpto-painting.
Nor is this form entirely new in the history of the plastic arts. The negroes of the Ivory Coast have made use of a very similar method of expression in their dance masks. These are constructed as follows: a completely flat plane forms the lower part of the face; to this is joined the high forehead, which is sometimes equally flat, sometimes bent slightly backward. While the nose is added as a simple strip of wood, two cylinders protrude about eight centimeters to form the eyes, and one slightly shorter hexahedron forms the mouth. The frontal surfaces of the cylinder and hexahedron are painted, and the hair is represented by raffia. It is true that the form is still closed here; however, it is not the ""real"" form, but rather a tight formal scheme of plastic primeval force. Here, too, we find a scheme of forms and ""real details"" (the painted eyes, mouth and hair) as stimuli. The result in the mind of the spectator, the desired effect, is a human face.""
Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones) along with the arts of diverse cultures. In the spring of 1908 Picasso worked on the representation of three-dimensional form and its position in space on a two-dimensional surface. ""Picasso painted figures resembling Congo sculptures"", wrote Kahnweiler, ""and still lifes of the simplest form. His perspective in these works is similar to that of Cézanne"".


== Cubist styles ==

The diverse styles of Cubism have been associated with the formal experiments of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso exhibited exclusively at the Kahnweiler gallery. However, alternative contemporary views on Cubism have formed to some degree in response to the more publicized Salon Cubists (Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Alexander Archipenko and Joseph Csaky), whose methods and ideas were too distinct from those of Braque and Picasso to be considered merely secondary to them. Cubist sculpture, just as Cubist painting, is difficult to define. Cubism in general cannot definitively be called either a style, the art of a specific group or even a specific movement. ""It embraces widely disparate work, applying to artists in different milieux"". (Christopher Green)
Artist sculptors working in Montparnasse were quick to adopt the language of non-Euclidean geometry, rendering three-dimensional objects by shifting viewpoints and of volume or mass in terms of successive curved or flat planes and surfaces. Alexander Archipenko's 1912 Walking Woman is cited as the first modern sculpture with an abstracted void, i.e., a hole in the middle. Joseph Csaky, following Archipenko, was the first sculptor to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onward. They were joined by Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and then in 1914 by Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and later Ossip Zadkine.
According to Herbert Read, this has the effect of ""revealing the structure"" of the object, or of presenting fragments and facets of the object to be visually interpreted in different ways. Both of these effects transfer to sculpture. Although the artists themselves did not use these terms, the distinction between ""analytic cubism"" and ""synthetic cubism"" could also be seen in sculpture, writes Read (1964): ""In the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque, the definite purpose of the geometricization of the planes is to emphasize the formal structure of the motif represented. In the synthetic Cubism of Juan Gris the definite purpose is to create an effective formal pattern, geometricization being a means to this end.""


=== Alexander Archipenko ===

Alexander Archipenko studied Egyptian and archaic Greek figures in the Louvre in 1908 when he arrived in Paris. He was ""the first"", according to Barr, ""to work seriously and consistently at the problem of Cubist sculpture"". His torso entitled ""Hero"" (1910) appears related stylistically to Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, ""but in its energetic three-dimensional torsion it is entirely independent of Cubist painting."" (Barr)
Archipenko evolved in close contact with the Salon Cubists (Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Joseph Csaky and others). At the same time, his affinities with Futurism were documented by the British magazine The Sketch in October 1913, where Archipenko's Dancers (Dance), reproduced on its front cover, was described as a 'Futurist sculpture'. ""In this work"", writes Alexandra Keiser, ""two abstracted figures are engaged in a dynamic dance movement."" Moreover, the chiaroscuro observed in the photographic reproduction ""accentuated the artist's multi-faceted use of positive and negative space as a compositional element to create dynamic movement, in both the fragmentation of the dancers' bodies as well as in the void created between their bodies"". In the photographic reproduction of Dancers, writes Keiser, ""the sculpture is set off at an angle reinforcing the idea of dynamism and creating the illusion that the sculpture is propelled through space. The sculpture Dance itself as well as the style of its reproduction played strongly to the generalized notions of Futurism and to the idea that sculpture could be conceived as a specifically modern medium"".
Herwarth Walden of Der Sturm in Berlin described Archipenko as 'the most important sculptor of our time'. Walden also promoted Archipenko as the foremost Expressionist sculptor. (Before World War I Expressionism encompassed several definitions and artistic concepts. Walden used the term to describe modern art movements including Futurism and Cubism).
Archipenko's Woman with a Fan (1914) combines high-relief sculpture with painted colors (polychrome) to create striking illusions of volumetric space. Experimenting with the dynamic interplay of convex and concave surfaces, Archipenko created works such as Woman Combing her Hair (1915). Depending on the movement around the sculpture and effects of lighting, concave and convex surfaces appear alternately to protrude or recede. His use of sculptural voids was inspired by the philosopher Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution (1907) on the distortions of our understanding of reality, and how our intellect tends to define unanticipated circumstances positively or negatively. 'If the present reality is not one we are seeking, we speak of an absence of this sought reality wherever we find the presence of another'. ""Archipenko's sculptural voids"", write Antliff and Leighten, ""allows us to fill this illusory gap with our own durational consciousness"".
In 1914, Arthur Jerome Eddy examined what made Archipenko's sculpture, Family Life, exhibited at the Armory Show unique, powerful, modern and Cubist:

 In his ""Family Life,"" the group of man, woman, child, Archipenko deliberately subordinated all thought of beauty of form to an attempt to realize in stone the relation in life that is at the very basis of human and social existence.
Spiritual, emotional, and mathematical intellectuality, too, is behind the family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore, the hands were not essential. And this expression is made in the simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.

The group is so angular, so Cubist, so ugly according to accepted notions, that few look long enough to see what the sculptor means; yet strange as the group was it undeniably gave a powerful impression of the binding, the blending character of the family tie, a much more powerful impression than groups in conventional academic pose could give.


=== Joseph Csaky ===

Joseph Csaky arrived in Paris from his native Hungary during the summer of 1908. By autumn of 1908 Csaky shared a studio space at Cité Falguière with Joseph Brummer, a Hungarian friend who had opened the Brummer Gallery with his brothers. Within three weeks, Brummer showed Csaky a sculpture he was working on: an exact copy of an African sculpture from the Congo. Brummer told Csaky that another artist in Paris, a Spaniard by the name of Pablo Picasso, was painting in the spirit of 'Negro' sculptures.
Living and working at La Ruche in Montparnasse, Csaky exhibited his highly stylized 1909 sculpture Tête de femme (Portrait de Jeanne) at the 1910 Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, now significantly beyond the influence of Auguste Rodin. The following year he exhibited a proto-Cubist work entitled Mademoiselle Douell (1910).
Csaky's proto-Cubist works include Femme et enfant (1909), collection Zborovsky, Tête de femme de profil (1909), exhibited Société National des Beaux-Arts, 1910, Tête de femme de face (1909). By 1910-11 Csaky's Cubist works included Tête d'homme, Autoportrait, Tête Cubiste (1911), exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1911.
In 1911, Csaky exhibited his Cubist sculptures, including Mademoiselle Douell (no. 1831) at the Salon des Indépendants (21 April - 13 June) with Archipenko, Duchamp, Gleizes, Laurencin, La Fresnaye, Léger, Picabia and Metzinger. This exhibition provoked a scandal out of which Cubism was revealed to the general public for the first time. From that exhibition it emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond.
Four months later Csaky exhibited at the Salon d'Automne (1 October - 8 November) in room XI together with the same artists, in addition to Modigliani and František Kupka, his Groupe de femmes (1911–1912), a massive, highly stylized block-like sculpture representing three women. At the same Salon Csaky exhibited Portrait de M.S.H., no. 91, his deeply faceted Danseuse (Femme à l'éventail, Femme à la cruche), no. 405, and Tête d'homme (Tête d'adolescent) no. 328, the first in a series of self-portraits that would become increasingly abstract in accord with his Cubist sensibility.
The following spring, Csaky showed at the Salon des Indépendants (1913) with the same group, including Lhote, Duchamp-Villon and Villon.

Csaky exhibited as a member of Section d'Or at the Galerie La Boétie (10–30 October 1912), with Archipenko, Duchamp-Villon, La Fresnaye, Gleizes, Gris, Laurencin, Léger, Lhote, Marcoussis, Metzinger, Picabia, Kupka, Villon and Duchamp.
At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants, held March 9 through 18 May, Csaky exhibited his 1912 Tête de Femme (Buste de femme), an exceedingly faceted sculpture later purchased by Léonce Rosenberg. The Cubist works were shown in room 46. Metzinger exhibited his large L'Oiseau bleu — Albert Gleizes, Albert Gleizes. Les Joueurs de football (Football Players) 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C — Robert Delaunay The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff ) 1913, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven — Fernand Léger, Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio) 1912-13, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York — Juan Gris, L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café) 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The inspirations that led Csaky to Cubism were diverse, as they were for artists of Le Bateau-Lavoir, and other still of the Section d'Or. Certainly Cézanne's geometric syntax was a significant influence, as well as Seurat's scientific approach to painting. Given a growing dissatisfaction with the classical methods of representation, and the contemporary changes—the industrial revolution, exposure to art from across the world—artists began to transform their expression. Now at 9 rue Blainville in the fifth arrondissement in Paris Csaky—along with the Cubist sculptors who would follow—stimulated by the profound cultural changes and his own experiences, contributed his own personal artistic language to the movement.
Csaky wrote of the direction his art had taken during the crucial years:

""There was no question which was my way. True, I was not alone, but in the company of several artists who came from Eastern Europe. I joined the cubists in the Académie La Palette, which became the sanctuary of the new direction in art. On my part I did not want to imitate anyone or anything. This is why I joined the cubists movement."" (Joseph Csaky)
Joseph Csaky contributed substantially to the development of modern sculpture, both as an early pioneer in applying Cubist principles to sculpture, and as a leading figure in nonrepresentational art of the 1920s.


=== Raymond Duchamp-Villon ===

Although some comparison can be drawn between the mask-like totemic characteristics of various Gabon sculptures, primitive art was well beyond the conservative French sensibilities visible in the work of Raymond Duchamp-Villon. Gothic sculpture, on the other hand, seems to have provided Duchamp-Villon the impetus for expressing novel possibilities of human representation, in a manner parallel to that provided by African art for Derain, Picasso, Braque and others.
To his credit, Duchamp-Villon exhibited early on with the Cubists (Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Fernand Léger, Henri le Fauconnier, Roger de La Fresnaye, Francis Picabia, Joseph Csaky) at the 1912 Salon d'Automne; a massive public Cubist manifestation that caused yet another scandal, following from the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne of 1911. His role as architect of la Maison Cubiste (Cubist house) propelled him into the center of a politico-social scandal that accused the Cubists of foreign aesthetic inspiration.
With the same group, including his brothers Jacques Villon and Marcel Duchamp, he exhibited at the Salon de la Section d'Or in the fall of 1912.
In Les Peintres Cubistes (1913) Guillaume Apollinaire writes of Duchamp-Villon:

""The utilitarian end aimed at by most of the contemporary architects in the cause which keeps architecture considerably behind the other arts. The architect, the engineer should build with sublime intentions: to erect the highest tower, to prepare for time and the ivy, a ruin more beautiful than any other, to throw over a harbour or a river an arch more audacious than the rainbow, to compose above all a persistent harmony the most audacious that man has ever know.
Duchamp-Villon has this titanic conception of architecture. A sculptor and architect, light in the only thing that counts for him, and for all the other arts also, it is only light which counts, the incorruptible light."" (Apollinaire, 1913)


=== Jacques Lipchitz ===

The early sculptures of Jacques Lipchitz, 1911-1912, were conventional portraits and figure studies executed in the tradition of Aristide Maillol and Charles Despiau. He progressively turned toward Cubism in 1914 with periodic reference to Negro sculpture. His 1915 Baigneuse is comparable to figures from Gabun. In 1916 his figures became more abstract, though less so than those of Brâncuși's sculptures of 1912-1915. Lipchitz' Baigneuse Assise (70.5 cm) of 1916 is clearly reminiscent of Csaky's 1913 Figure de Femme Debout, 1913 (Figure Habillée) (80 cm), exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1913, with the same architectonic rendering of the shoulders, head, torso, and lower body, both with an angular pyramidal, cylindrical and spherical geometric armature. Just as some of the works of Picasso and Braque of the period are virtually indistinguishable, so too are Csaky's and Lipchitz sculptures, only Csaky's predates that of Lipchitz by three years.
Like Archipenko and Csaky, both Lipchitz and Henri Laurens were aware of primitive African art, though hardly evident in their works. Lipchitz collected African art from 1912 on, but Laurens, in fact, appears to have been entirely unaffected by African art. Both his early reliefs and three-dimensional sculptures attach problems posed by Cubist painters first. Lipchitz and Laurens were concerned with giving tangible substance",1
Solar longitude,"Solar longitude, commonly abbreviated as Ls, is the ecliptic longitude of the Sun, i.e. the position of the Sun on the celestial sphere along the ecliptic. It is also an effective measure of the position of the Earth (or any other Sun-orbiting body) in its orbit around the Sun, usually taken as zero at the moment of the vernal equinox. Since it is based on how far the Earth has moved in its orbit since the equinox, it is a measure of what time of the tropical year (the year of seasons) the planet is in, but without the inaccuracies of a calendar date, which is perturbed by leap years and calendar imperfections. Its independence from a calendar also allows it to be used to tell the time of year on other planets, such as Mars.
Solar longitude does not increase linearly with time, the deviation being larger the greater the eccentricity of the orbit. For instance, here are the dates for multiples of 90° solar longitude on Mars in the mid 1950s:


== Of meteor showers ==
Solar longitude is especially used in the field of meteor showers, because a particular meteor shower is caused by a stream of small particles very close to the elliptical orbit of a comet, or former comet. This means that the shower occurs when Earth reaches a particular point in its own orbit, designated by the solar longitude. For example, after passing the March equinox, the solar longitude (λ☉) of the April Lyrids is 32°.
The value of the solar longitude, like any ecliptic longitude, depends on the epoch being used. The solar longitude for a given meteor shower would therefore not be constant if the current date were used as the epoch. For this reason, a standard epoch is used, usually J2000.


== Of Mars ==

The Martian year can be divided into 12 Martian months of unequal duration, with the breakpoints being at solar longitudes that are multiples of 30°.

Seven species are native to southeast Asia in China, Indochina, and northeastern India (Assam), and twelve are native to North America, of which eleven occur in the United States, four in Mexico (of which one, C. palmeri, endemic there), and five extending into southern Canada.

Hickories are temperate to subtropical forest trees with pinnately compound leaves and large nuts. Most are deciduous, but one species (C. sinensis, syn. Annamocarya sinensis) in southeast Asia is evergreen. Hickory flowers are small, yellow-green catkins produced in spring. They are wind-pollinated and self-incompatible. The fruit is a globose or oval nut, 2–5 cm (0.8–2.0 in) long and 1.5–3 cm (0.6–1.2 in) diameter, enclosed in a four-valved husk, which splits open at maturity. The nut shell is thick and bony in most species, and thin in a few, notably the pecan (C. illinoinensis); it is divided into two halves, which split apart when the seed germinates.


== Etymology ==
The name ""hickory"" derives from a Native American word in an Algonquian language (perhaps Powhatan). It is a shortening of pockerchicory, pocohicora, or a similar word, which may be the name for the hickory tree's nut, or may be a milky drink made from such nuts. The genus name Carya is Ancient Greek: κάρυον, káryon, meaning ""nut"".


== Species and classification ==
The genus Carya (not to be confused with Careya in the Lecythidaceae) is in the walnut family, Juglandaceae. In the APG system, this family is included in the order Fagales. Several species are known to hybridize, with around nine accepted, named hybrids.

== Ecology ==
Hickory is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include:

Luna moth (Actias luna)
Brown-tail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea)
Coleophora case-bearers, C. laticornella and C. ostryae
Regal moths (Citheronia regalis), whose caterpillars are known as hickory horn-devils
Walnut sphinx (Amorpha juglandis)
The bride (nominate subspecies Catocala neogama neogama)
Hickory tussock moth (Lophocampa caryae)
The hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera (Phylloxera caryaecaulis) also uses the hickory tree as a food source. Phylloxeridae are related to aphids and have a similarly complex life cycle. Eggs hatch in early spring and the galls quickly form around the developing insects. Phylloxera galls may damage weakened or stressed hickories, but are generally harmless. Deformed leaves and twigs can rain down from the tree in the spring as squirrels break off infected tissue and eat the galls, possibly for the protein content or because the galls are fleshy and tasty to the squirrels. The pecan gall curculio (Conotrachelus elegans) is a true weevil species also found feeding on galls of the hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera.
The banded hickory borer (Knulliana cincta) is also found on hickories.


== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest fossils attributed to Carya are Cretaceous pollen grains from Mexico and New Mexico. Fossil and molecular data suggest the genus Carya may have diversified during the Miocene. Modern Carya first appear in Oligocene strata 34 million years ago. Recent discoveries of Carya fruit fossils further support the hypothesis that the genus has long been a member of Eastern North American landscapes, however its range has contracted and Carya is no longer extant west of the Rocky Mountains.
Fossils of early hickory nuts show simpler, thinner shells than modern species with the exception of pecans, suggesting that the trees gradually developed defenses to rodent seed predation. During this time, the genus had a distribution across the Northern Hemisphere, but the Pleistocene Ice Age beginning 2 million years ago obliterated it from Europe. In Anatolia, the genus appears to have disappeared only in the early Holocene, probably related to human disturbance. The distribution of Carya in North America also contracted and it completely disappeared from the continent west of the Rocky Mountains. Since fossil records show North America as having the largest number of Juglandaceae species, it is likely that the genus originated there and later spread to Europe and Asia.


== Fruit ==

Some fruits are borderline and difficult to categorize.  Hickory nuts (Carya) and walnuts (Juglans) in the Juglandaceae family grow within an outer husk; these fruits are sometimes considered to be drupes or drupaceous nuts, rather than true botanical nuts. ""Tryma"" is a specialized term for such nut-like drupes.


=== Nutrition ===
Dried hickory nuts are 3% water, 18% carbohydrates, 13% protein, and 64% fats (table). In a 100 gram (3.5 oz) reference amount, dried hickory nuts supply 657 calories, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins and dietary minerals, especially manganese at 220% DV (table).


== Uses ==

Hickory wood is hard, stiff, dense and shock resistant. There are woods stronger than hickory and woods that are harder, but the combination of strength, toughness, hardness, and stiffness found in hickory wood is not found in any other commercial wood.  Hickory is therefore used in a number of items requiring these properties, such as tool handles, bows, wheel spokes, walking sticks, and wood flooring. Baseball bats were formerly made of hickory, but are now more commonly made of ash; however, it is replacing ash as the wood of choice for Scottish shinty sticks. Hickory was also extensively used for the construction of early aircraft.
Due to its grain structure, hickory is more susceptible to moisture absorption than other species of wood, and is therefore more prone to shrinkage, warping or swelling with changes in humidity.
Hickory is also highly prized for wood-burning stoves and chimineas, as its density and high energy content make it an efficient fuel. Hickory wood is also a preferred type for smoking cured meats. In the Southern United States, hickory is popular for cooking barbecue, as hickory grows abundantly in the region and adds flavor to the meat.
An extract from shagbark hickory bark is also used in an edible syrup similar to maple syrup, with a slightly bitter, smoky taste. The Cherokee people would produce a green dye from hickory bark, which they used to dye cloth. When this bark was mixed with maple bark, it produced a yellow dye pigment. The ashes of burnt hickory wood were traditionally used to produce a strong lye (potash) fit for soapmaking.
The nuts of some species are palatable and were used by Cherokee Indians in making Kanuchi soup, while others are bitter and only suitable for animal feed. Shagbark and shellbark hickory, along with pecan, are regarded by some as the finest nut trees. Pecans are the most important nut tree native to North America.
When cultivated for their nuts, clonal (grafted) trees of the same cultivar cannot pollinate each other because of their self-incompatibility. Two or more cultivars must be planted together for successful pollination. Seedlings (grown from hickory nuts) will usually have sufficient genetic variation.

Holy Spirit,"In Nicene Christianity, the Holy Spirit, otherwise known as the Holy Ghost, is the third person of the Trinity. In Judaism, the Holy Spirit is the divine force, quality and influence of the unitary God over the universe or his creatures. In Islam, the Holy Spirit acts as an agent of divine action or communication. In the Baha’i Faith, the Holy Spirit is seen as the intermediary between God and man and ""the outpouring grace of God and the effulgent rays that emanate from His Manifestation"".


== Comparative religion ==
The Hebrew Bible contains the term ""spirit of God"" (ruach elochim) which by Jews is interpreted in the sense of the might of a unitary God. This interpretation is different from the Nicene Christian conception of the Holy Spirit as one person of the Trinity.
The Christian concept tends to emphasize the moral aspect of the Holy Spirit as a common expression in the Christian New Testament. Based on the Old Testament, the book of Acts emphasizes the power of ministry aspect of the Holy Spirit.
In general, Jews reject any conception of a co-equal, multi-person godhead; anything but an absolute monotheism is contrary to the Shema. They do not consider the Hebrew word for ""one"" (Hebrew: אחד, ekhad) as meaning anything other than a simple numerical one. The rabbinical understanding of the Holy Spirit has a certain degree of personification, but it remains, ""a quality belonging to God, one of his attributes"". The idea of God as a duality or trinity is considered shituf (or ""not purely monotheistic"").
According to theologian Rudolf Bultmann, there are two ways to think about the Holy Spirit: ""animistic"" and ""dynamistic"". In animistic thinking, he is ""an independent agent, a personal power which (...) can fall upon a man and take possession of him, enabling him or compelling him to perform manifestations of power"" while in dynamistic thought it ""appears as an impersonal force which fills a man like a fluid"". Both kinds of thought appear in Jewish and Christian scripture, but animistic is more typical of the Old Testament whereas dynamistic is more common in the New Testament. The distinction coincides with the Holy Spirit as either a temporary or permanent gift. In the Old Testament and Jewish thought, it is primarily temporary with a specific situation or task in mind, whereas in the Christian concept the gift resides in persons permanently.
On the surface, the Holy Spirit appears to have an equivalent in non-Abrahamic Hellenistic mystery religions. These religions included a distinction between the spirit and psyche, which is also seen in the Pauline epistles. According to proponents of the History of religions school, the Christian concept of the Holy Spirit cannot be explained from Jewish ideas alone without reference to the Hellenistic religions. And according to theologian Erik Konsmo, the views ""are so dissimilar that the only legitimate connection one can make is with the Greek term πνεῦμα [pneuma, Spirit] itself"".
Another link with ancient Greek thought is the Stoic idea of the spirit as anima mundi – or world soul – that unites all people. Some believe that this can be seen in Paul's formulation of the concept of the Holy Spirit that unites Christians in Jesus Christ and love for one another, but Konsmo again thinks that this position is difficult to maintain. In his Introduction to the 1964 book Meditations, the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote:

Another Stoic concept which offered inspiration to the Church was that of ""divine Spirit"". Cleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's ""creative fire"", had been the first to hit upon the term pneuma, or ""spirit"", to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent ""spirit"" was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the ""Holy Spirit"" of Christian theology, the ""Lord and Giver of life"", visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated – in the Christian as in the Stoic mind – with the ideas of vital fire and beneficent warmth.


== Abrahamic religions ==


=== Judaism ===

The Hebrew language phrase ruach ha-kodesh (Hebrew: רוח הקודש, ""holy spirit"" also transliterated ruaḥ ha-qodesh) is used in the Hebrew Bible and Jewish writings to refer to the spirit of YHWH (רוח יהוה). The Hebrew terms ruacḥ qodshəka, ""thy holy spirit"" (רוּחַ קָדְשְׁךָ), and ruacḥ qodshō, ""his holy spirit"" (רוּחַ קָדְשׁוֹ), also occur (when a possessive suffix is added the definite article ha is dropped).
The Holy Spirit in Judaism generally refers to the divine aspect of prophecy and wisdom. It also refers to the divine force, quality, and influence of the Most High God, over the universe or over his creatures, in given contexts.


=== Christianity ===

For the large majority of Christians, the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost, from Old English gast, ""spirit"") is the third person of the Trinity: The ""Triune God"" manifested as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; each Person being God. Two symbols from the New Testament canon are associated with the Holy Spirit in Christian iconography: a winged dove, and tongues of fire. Each depiction of the Holy Spirit arose from different accounts in the Gospel narratives; the first being at the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River where the Holy Spirit was said to descend in the form of a dove as the voice of God the Father spoke as described in Matthew, Mark, and Luke; the second being from the day of Pentecost, fifty days after Passover where the descent of the Holy Spirit came upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ, as tongues of fire as described in the Acts of the Apostles, as promised by Jesus in his farewell discourse. 
Called ""the unveiled epiphany of God"", the Holy Spirit is the One who empowers the followers of Jesus with spiritual gifts and power that enables the proclamation of Jesus Christ, and the power that brings conviction of faith.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Islam ===

The Holy Spirit (Arabic: روح القدس, romanized: Ruh al-Qudus, ""the Spirit of Holiness"") is mentioned four times in the Qur'an, where it acts as an agent of divine action or communication. The Muslim interpretation of the Holy Spirit is generally consistent with other interpretations based upon the Old and the New Testaments. On the basis of narrations in certain Hadith, some Muslims identify it with the angel Gabriel (Arabic Jibrāʾīl). The Spirit (الروح al-Ruh, without the adjective ""holy"" or ""exalted"") is described, among other things, as the creative spirit from God by which God enlivened Adam, and which inspired in various ways God's messengers and prophets, including Jesus and Abraham. The belief in a ""Holy Trinity"", according to the Qur'an, is forbidden and deemed to be blasphemy. The same prohibition applies to any idea of the duality of God (Allah).


=== Baháʼí Faith ===

The Baháʼí Faith has the concept of the Most Great Spirit, seen as the bounty of God. It is usually used to describe the descent of the Spirit of God upon the messengers/prophets of God who include, among others, Jesus, Muhammad and Bahá'u'lláh.
In Baháʼí belief, the Holy Spirit is the conduit through which the wisdom of God becomes directly associated with his messenger, and it has been described variously in different religions such as the burning bush to Moses, the sacred fire to Zoroaster, the dove to Jesus, the angel Gabriel to Muhammad, and the Maid of Heaven to Bahá'u'lláh (founder of the Baháʼí Faith). The Baháʼí view rejects the idea that the Holy Spirit is a partner to God in the Godhead, but rather is the pure essence of God's attributes.


== Other religions ==


=== Hinduism ===

The Hindu concept of Advaita is linked to the Trinity, according to the theologian Raimon Panikkar. He states that the Holy Spirit, as one of the Three Persons of the Trinity of ""father, Logos and Holy Spirit"", is a bridge-builder between Christianity and Hinduism. He explains that: ""The meeting of spiritualistic can take place in the Spirit. No new 'system' has primarily to come of this encounter, but a new and yet old spirit must emerge."" Atman is Vedic terminology elaborated in Hindu scriptures such as Upanishads and Vedanta signifies the Ultimate Reality and Absolute.


=== Zoroastrianism ===
In Zoroastrianism, the Holy Spirit, also known as Spenta Mainyu, is a hypostasis of Ahura Mazda, the supreme Creator God of Zoroastrianism; the Holy Spirit is seen as the source of all goodness in the universe, the spark of all life within humanity, and is the ultimate guide for humanity to righteousness and communion with God. The Holy Spirit is put in direct opposition to its eternal dual counterpart, Angra Mainyu, who is the source of all wickedness and who leads humanity astray.


=== Gnosticism ===
The ancient Gnostic text known as the Secret Book of John refers to the supreme female principle Barbelo as the Holy Spirit.

Right ascension,"Right ascension (abbreviated RA; symbol α) is the astronomical word for one of the two coordinates of a point on the celestial sphere when using the equatorial coordinate system. It is the celestial counterpart to longitude. The other coordinate is the declination.
The moon, planets and stars all have their own right ascension. Many of them are listed in an almanac. Using arithmetic, the object’s right ascension and declination indicate where to look in the sky to see the object.

Pyrokinesis,"Pyrokinesis is a psychic ability allowing a person to create and control fire with the mind. As with other parapsychological phenomena, there is no conclusive evidence in support of the actual existence of pyrokinesis. Many alleged cases are hoaxes; the result of trickery.


== Etymology ==
The word pyrokinesis (from Greek pyr meaning fire, kinesis meaning movement) was popularized by horror novelist Stephen King in his 1980 novel Firestarter to describe the ability to create and control fire with the mind, though its use predates the novel. The word is intended to be parallel to telekinesis, with S. T. Joshi describing it as a ""singularly unfortunate coinage"" and noting that the correct analogy to telekinesis would ""not be 'pyrokinesis' but 'telepyrosis' (fire from a distance)"".


== History ==
A. W. Underwood, a 19th-century African-American, achieved minor celebrity status with the ability to set items ablaze. Magicians and scientists have suggested concealed pieces of phosphorus may have instead been responsible. The phosphorus could be readily ignited by breath or rubbing. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that Underwood may have used a ""chemical-combustion technique, and still other means. Whatever the exact method — and the phosphorus trick might be the most likely — the possibilities of deception far outweigh any occult powers hinted at by Charles Fort or others.""
The medium Daniel Dunglas Home was known for performing fire feats and handling a heated lump of coal taken from a fire. The magician Henry R. Evans wrote that the coal handling was a juggling trick, performed by Home using a hidden piece of platinum. Hereward Carrington described Evans hypothesis as ""certainly ingenious"" but pointed out William Crookes, an experienced chemist, was present at a séance whilst Home performed the feat and would have known how to distinguish the difference between coal and platinum. Frank Podmore wrote that most of the fire feats could have easily been performed by conjuring tricks and sleight of hand but hallucination and sense-deception may have explained Crookes' claim about observing flames from Home's fingers.
Joseph McCabe has written that Home's alleged feats of pyrokinesis were weak and unsatisfactory, he noted that they were performed in dark conditions amongst unreliable witnesses. McCabe suggested the coal handling was probably a ""piece of asbestos from Home's pocket"".
Sometimes claims of pyrokinesis are published in the context of fire ghosts, such as Canneto di Caronia fires and the 1982 Italian case of a young Scottish nanny, Carole Compton.
In March 2011, a three-year-old girl in Antique, a Philippines province with important mysticism and folklore, gained local media attention for the supposed supernatural power to predict or create fires. The town mayor said he witnessed a pillow ignite after the girl said ""fire... pillow."" Others claimed to have witnessed the girl either predicting or causing fire without any physical contact with the objects. A pastor claimed to have exorcised the girl and police failed to find anything abnormal although a paranormal proponent claimed that she must have inherited those powers from a previous life. The story of the alleged ""fire starter"" was featured on the June 22, 2020 Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho show. Since several objects around the house were ignited, local residents flocked to the girl's house to learn of the circumstances and emergency services visited the house to investigate.
There is no scientifically known method for the brain to trigger explosions or fires.

Third medium contact method,"The third medium contact (TMC) is an implicit formulation for contact mechanics. Contacting bodies are embedded in a highly compliant medium (the third medium), which becomes increasingly stiff under compression. The stiffening of the third medium allows tractions to be transferred between the contacting bodies when the third medium between the bodies is compressed. In itself, the method is inexact; however, in contrast to most other contact methods, the third medium approach is continuous and differentiable, which makes it applicable to applications such as topology optimization.
The method was first proposed by Peter Wriggers, Jörg Schröder, and Alexander Schwarz where a St. Venant-Kirchhoff material was used to model the third medium. This approach requires explicit treatment of surface normals. A simplification to the method was offered by Bog et al. by applying a Hencky material with the inherent property of becoming rigid under ultimate compression. This property has made the explicit treatment of surface normals redundant, thereby transforming the third medium contact method into a fully implicit method, which is a contrast to the more widely used Mortar methods or Penalty methods. The addition of a new regularization by Bluhm et al. to stabilize the third medium further extended the method to applications involving moderate sliding, rendering it practically applicable.

Cedrus,"Cedrus, with the common English name cedar, is a genus of coniferous trees in the plant family Pinaceae (subfamily Abietoideae).  They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region, occurring at altitudes of 1,500–3,200 m (4,900–10,500 ft) in the Himalayas and 1,000–2,200 m (3,300–7,200 ft) in the Mediterranean.


== Description ==

Cedrus trees can grow up to 30–40 m (occasionally 60 m) tall with spicy-resinous scented wood, thick ridged or square-cracked bark, and broad, level branches.  The shoots are dimorphic and are made up of long shoots, which form the framework of the branches, and short shoots, which carry most of the leaves.  The leaves are evergreen and needle-like, 8–60 mm long, arranged in an open spiral phyllotaxis on long shoots, and in dense spiral clusters of 15–45 together on short shoots; they vary from bright grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green, depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from desiccation.  The seed cones are barrel-shaped, 6–12 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, green maturing grey-brown, and, as in Abies, disintegrate at maturity to release the winged seeds.  The seeds are 10–15 mm long, with a 20–30 mm wing; as in Abies, the seeds have two or three resin blisters, containing an unpleasant-tasting resin, thought to be a defence against squirrel predation.  Cone maturation takes one year, with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing at the same time a year later.  The pollen cones are slender ovoid, 3–8 cm long, produced in late summer, and shed pollen in autumn.


== Classification ==
Cedars share a very similar cone structure with the firs (Abies) and were traditionally thought to be most closely related to them, but molecular evidence supports a basal position in the family.

The five taxa of Cedrus are assigned according to taxonomic opinion to between one and four species: The oldest known fossil of Cedrus is Cedrus penzhinaensis known from fossil wood found in Early Cretaceous (Albian) sediments of Kamchatka, Russia.


== Ecology ==
Cedars are adapted to mountainous climates; in the Mediterranean, they receive winter precipitation, mainly as snow, and summer drought, while in the western Himalaya, they receive primarily summer monsoon rainfall and occasional winter snowfall.  While no members of Cedrus are native to the  Americas, members of Juniperus and Cupressaceae are native and are called by the common name of ""cedar"".
Cedars are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including pine processionary and turnip moth (recorded on deodar cedar).


== Use ==

Cedars are very popular ornamental trees, and are often cultivated in temperate climates where winter temperatures do not fall below circa −25 °C.  The Turkish cedar is slightly hardier, to −30 °C or just below.  Extensive mortality of planted specimens can occur in severe winters when temperatures fall lower. Locales with successful longaeval cultivation include the Mediterranean region, Western Europe north to the British Isles, southern Australia and New Zealand, and southern and western North America.
Cedar wood and cedarwood oil are natural repellents to moths, hence cedar is a popular lining for cedar chests and closets in which woolens are stored. This specific use of cedar is mentioned in The Iliad, Book 24, referring to the cedar-roofed or lined storage chamber where Priam went to fetch treasures to be used as ransom. The ancients made cedarwood oil from Lebanon cedar, a true cedar of the genus Cedrus,  However, the species used for modern cedar chests and closets in North America is Juniperus virginiana, and cedarwood oil is now typically derived from various junipers and cypresses (of the family Cupressaceae). Cedar is also commonly used to make shoe trees because it can absorb moisture and deodorize.
Many species of cedar are suitable for training as bonsai. They work well for many styles, including formal and informal upright, slanting, and cascading.


== Nomenclature ==
Some authorities consider Cedrus the only ""true cedars""  and discourage use of the name for other genera without an additional qualifier, such as ""white-cedar"". Nevertheless, the name ""cedar"" has been applied (since about 1700) to other trees, such as the North American Thuja plicata, commonly called ""western red cedar"", and Juniperus virginiana, commonly called ""red cedar"" or ""eastern red cedar"".  In some cases, the botanical name alludes to this usage, such as the genus Calocedrus, meaning ""beautiful cedar"" (also known as ""incense cedar"").  Several species of genera Calocedrus, Thuja, and Chamaecyparis in the Pacific Northwest having similarly aromatic wood are referred to as ""false cedars"" .  In Australia Toona ciliata has long been known as red cedar, in furniture and as the tree, even though it belongs to the Meliaceae or Mahogany family.


=== Etymology ===
Both the Latin word cedrus and the generic name cedrus are derived from Greek κέδρος kédros.  Ancient Greek and Latin used the same word, kédros and cedrus, respectively, for different species of plants now classified in the genera Cedrus and Juniperus (juniper).  Species of both genera are native to the area where Greek language and culture originated, though as the word kédros does not seem to be derived from any of the languages of the Middle East, it has been suggested the word may originally have applied to Greek species of juniper and was later adopted for species now classified in the genus Cedrus because of the similarity of their aromatic woods.  The name was similarly applied to citron and the word citrus is derived from the same root.  However, as a loan word in English, cedar had become fixed to its biblical sense of Cedrus by the time of its first recorded usage in AD 1000.

Subsolar point,"The subsolar point on a planet is when its Sun looks like it is directly overhead (in zenith). For planets with a rotation like the Earth's, the subsolar point will move westward, circling the globe once a day.",0
Ember,"An ember, also called a hot coal, is a hot lump of smouldering solid fuel, typically glowing, composed of greatly heated wood, coal, or other carbon-based material. Embers (hot coals) can exist within, remain after, or sometimes precede, a fire. Embers are, in some cases, as hot as the fire which created them. They radiate a substantial amount of heat long after the fire has been extinguished, and if not taken care of properly can rekindle a fire that is thought to be completely extinguished and can pose a fire hazard. In order to avoid the danger of accidentally spreading a fire, many campers pour water on the embers or cover them in dirt. Alternatively, embers can be used to relight a fire after it has gone out without the need to rebuild the fire – in a conventional fireplace, a fire can easily be relit up to 12 hours after it goes out, provided that there is enough space for air to circulate between the embers and the introduced fuel.
They are often used for cooking, such as in charcoal barbecues. This is because embers radiate a more consistent form of heat, as opposed to an open fire, which is constantly changing along with the heat it radiates.
An ember is formed when a fire has only partially burnt a piece of fuel, and there is still usable chemical energy in that piece of fuel. This happens because the usable chemical energy is so deep into the center that air (specifically oxygen) does not reach it, and it therefore does not combust (carbon-based fuel + O2 → CO2 + H2O + C + other chemicals involved). It continues to stay hot and does not lose its thermal energy quickly because combustion is still happening at a low level. The small yellow, orange and red lights often seen among the embers are actually combustion; the combustion is just not happening at a fast enough rate to create a flame. Once the embers are completely 'burned through', the remains are oxidized minerals like carbon, calcium and phosphorus. At that point they are called ashes.
Embers play a large role in forest fires, wildland fires or wildland urban interface fires. Because embers are typically burnt leaves and thus small and lightweight, they can easily become airborne. During a large fire, with the right conditions, embers can be blown far ahead of the fire front, starting spot fires several kilometres/miles away.  A number of practical measures can be undertaken by homeowners to reduce the consequences of such an ""ember attack"" that bombards especially wooden structures and starts property fires.

Foreign reserve,"A foreign reserve is the currency from another nation that is held by a nation's treasury. They are another set of assets in a country. Formerly, only gold and silver were used as reserves, but now the currency of other countries is used. There is a benefit to having a foreign reserve. When a nation has one, it can change the exchange rate to make it best for the country. But sometimes the exchange rate drops and the foreign reserve becomes worthless.

Gender pension gap,"The gender pension gap (also known as the sex pension gap) is the percentage difference in pension income between women and men. It is often calculated as the difference between the average man's pension and the average woman's pension, expressed as a percentage of the man's. The gap averages 26% across OECD countries.


== Background ==
Margaret Franklin, the President and CEO of the  Chartered Financial Analysts Institute  highlighted in 2021 that ""The gender gap in retirement benefits does not grab headlines in the same manner as the pay gap, yet the issue remains no less urgent. And it needs fixing before even more women face poverty in retirement"".
Analysis by Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index (MCGPI) highlighted that there was no single cause of the gap and all regions have significant  gender differences in the level of retirement income.
In the UK there is no official government assessment of the size of the pension gap, nor policies specifically to address it. Estimates suggest that the gap increased to 37.9% in 2019–20, which is more than twice the size of the gender pay gap (15.5%). Women in retirement have 72% lower pension income than men The average pension pot of a woman in the UK at retirement (£10,000) is less than half that of a man (£21,000).
The gender pension gap is linked to the gender pay gap  because it is partially caused by cumulative impact over time of women earning less than men, but it is particularly disadvantageous because women can take very little action to rectify it. Although it is illegal to pay women unfairly, there are many societal and structural conditions which cause the pay and pension gaps to remain and grow. The pension gap is particularly stark in areas of work which are traditionally female dominated.  Research using data from Legal and General pension scheme members in the UK showed a typical gender pension gap of 56% at retirement. The gap impacts single women (and single mothers) more than those who are married .
European data (for 27 EU countries) indicates that the sex pension gap is most marked in Luxembourg, where women received 44% less pension, followed by Malta and the Netherlands (both 40%), Cyprus (39%), Austria (37%) and Germany (36%). Japan has a gap of 50% and Canada's gap is around 22%.


== Causes ==
A number of structural, cultural and behavioural factors contribute to the pensions gap, including:

imbalance in the level of  pension saving.
disparities in pay rises (""the gender pay rise gap""). Research suggests that disparities in pay rises contribute to the gender pension gap.
indirect gender discrimination  built into the pension system. Millions of women miss out on workplace pensions because they do not qualify for auto enrollment into their scheme as they work in low-paid, or several part-time jobs
women who are divorced may lose out on pension income as a result 
inconsistent use of shared parental leave. Recent research suggests that more men taking shared parental leave would reduce the pension gap.
lack of access to affordable childcare. This restricts the work opportunities of women, and childcare costs paid by women leave less disposable income for saving.
differences in risk aversion, financial risk tolerance and financial literacy.
lower wages in female-dominated industries, such as hospitality, health and education.


=== Gender pension imbalance (United Kingdom) ===
The United Kingdom (UK) state pension was awarded at 65 years of age for men and 60 years  for women until the 1995 Pensions Act which was to phase in a 'balance' to move women's pension age to equal that of men. The option to move men to 60 or to choose another age between the two was not taken up. The change was to be phased in over a ten-year period but the timeline was accelerated in the 2011 Pensions Act, which was said to have disadvantaged 2.6million women born between April 1951 and 1960, some having to wait a further 6 years before being able to claim their pension.
A protest group Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) was created in 2015, and an online petition of 118,000 signatures asked Parliament for a formal debate on the matter, which took place in February 2016.  Further protests took place and a crowd-funded legal action was taken contending the inequality of treatment of this cohort. Events marking the 2018 VOTE100 women's marches to mark the centenary of (some) women being given the franchise in the UK and International Women's Day;  pension justice was raised among other inequalities and issues affecting only women, in a UK Parliamentary debate again.  There were contrary views on the merits of the argument that women had been unfairly treated.
The issue of pension gaps, and the impact on the 1950s women featured in election campaigns in 2019.  Another women's action group #backto60 took the view that full compensation for the women affected was appropriate, rather than a limited 'compensation' for the lack of government communications, and their crowd-funded court case led by Michael Mansfield, QC, was not finally supported by the Supreme Court in 2021, for the right of appeal.  However the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman found and reported in July 2021, based on six 'test cases' that there was 'maladministration' in the communications to women about their changes in state pension, by the relevant department of UK government (DWP). The Ombudsman updated the public information into its enquiry in February 2022, indicating that it was now awaiting evidence from the Department for Work and Pensions due by the end of March 2022, without which it cannot begin the 'stage two of..investigation and considering whether the failings.. identified led to an injustice for the complainants.'  Sixty-four members of Parliament have backed a motion by Labour MP, Ian Byrne calling for full restitution (which supports #backto60 and 'We Paid In You Pay Out' groups' view), but other protest groups (WASPI) and the official All Party Parliamentary Group on State Pension Inequality for Women (APPG) propose a lesser compensation.
A wider review of the pension gap in the context of the lack of legislative implementation by successive UK governments, of the United Nations CEDAW Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women into UK law, held a people's tribunal in 2021,  and took evidence which recommended that the UK should introduce a women's bill of rights.


== Solutions ==
Juan Yermo, Chief of Staff to the OECD Secretary-General, has said, ""Policy makers need to account for and address the factors that can lead to gender inequalities, and should strive to design gender-neutral retirement savings arrangements."". In the UK, the Prospect Union have called for the government to tackle the gender pension gap through reform of automatic enrollment, additional state pension credit and affordable childcare  and changes to the tax system. Researchers who analyse data about the pension gap over time highlight that  current gaps in pension income reflect labour markets and pension contribution patterns from many years ago, people working now may have a different experience when they reach retirement. The gap increased during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic  but the new experiments with alternative styles of working may offer employers opportunities to implement more flexible policies that will encourage more women to remain in the workforce.

Patronage,"Patronage is the support, encouragement, privilege and often financial aid given by a person or an organization. It can also refer to the business given by a regular customer, and the guardianship of saints.
In some countries the term is often used to describe the corrupt use of state money and goods to benefit groups, families, ethnicities or races in exchange for votes. These patronage systems are different depending on the area in which they are practiced.
The term comes from the Latin patronatus.

Slang terms for money,"Slang terms for money often derive from the appearance and features of banknotes or coins, their values, historical associations or the units of currency concerned. Within a language community, some of the slang terms vary in social, ethnic, economic, and geographic strata but others have become the dominant way of referring to the currency and are regarded as mainstream, acceptable language (for example, ""buck"" for a dollar or similar currency in various nations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Nigeria and the United States).


== Argentina ==
In Argentina, over the years and despite many devaluation milestones, the lunfardo managed to persist in time some special nicknames to certain amount of money, not because color or type of the bill but to different meanings and uses.
Senior people above 65 now (previous to baby-boomer generation) used to call ""guita"" to the coins of low denomination of cents ('centavos'), like 2, 5 or 10 cent coins. So ""10 guita"" meant 10 cents of peso. Today the cents are still legal but non-existent. The word ""guita"" in lunfardo is synonym for ""money"".
During the short period of the ""Austral"" which replaced the traditional ""Peso"" monetary bill, after the dictatorship of 1976 (between 1983 and 1990) and in the recent years after year 2,000, people used to call ""palo"" (stick) to the ""million"" of australes or pesos, so ""2 palos"" refers to 2 million pesos.
For the last 20 years or more, after year 1997 at least, and during the government of president Menem, as probably the hiatus of the pre-devaluation era before year 2000, and even today people got used to call ""luca"" to thousands of pesos, so ""5 lucas"" means 5 thousand pesos. Lucas, is a typical masculine name among the X Generation in Argentina.
Another nickname for the singular peso is ""mango"", but nobody would call 35,000 ""mangos"" when they can say 35 ""lucas"". Also nobody would say 1,000 ""lucas"" when they can simply say 1 ""palo"" (1 million pesos)


== Australia ==


=== Current denominations ===
The five-cent coin is sometimes referred to as ""shrapnel"" as the smallest remaining coin in value and physical size. This nickname was inherited from one- and two-cent coins when they were abolished in 1996.  Similarly related (as is also used in the United Kingdom for pounds), ""fivers"" and ""tenners"" are relatively common expressions for five and ten dollars, respectively.
""Beer tokens"" can relate to any denomination or combination of. This is also in keeping with the reverse, in which ""bottle tops"" can be used as an expression of holding, offering, or having a low amount of money.
A twenty-dollar note is called a ""lobster"" or redback because of its red colour.
A fifty-dollar note is also known colloquially as a ""pineapple"" or the ""Big Pineapple"" because of its yellow colour.
The $100 note is currently green and is known colloquially as a “watermelon”, but between 1984 and 1996 it was grey, and was called a grey nurse (a type of shark).
Modern polymer Australian notes have multiple nicknames and varying levels of usage dependant on location and socio-economic class. The notes most commonly receive their nicknames from the colour of the denomination. the $5 note is most commonly referred to as a ""fiver"", but also is sometimes nicknamed a ""pink lady"", or a ""prawn"". The $10 note is referred to as a ""tenner"" or again, less commonly, a ""Blue Swimmer"", other variations of this nickname exist such as the ""blue grenadier"", it may also rarely be called a ""blue tongue"", in reference to the Australian blue-tongue lizard. $20 notes are most often called a ""lobbo"" or ""lobster"", due to the red colour. By far the most commonly used slang for a modern Australian note is the $50 denomination, referred to as either a ""pineapple"", or a ""fiddy"". The $100 note is less common than the $50 note, and thereby nicknames vary a lot more, the most frequently used is a ""watermelon"", but is also referred to as a ""granny smith"" both due to the green colour, a ""Bradman"", in reference to Australian cricketer's 99.94  batting average by  Sir Donald Bradman, or ""melba"", in reference to the late Australian opera singer on the note.
Australians also use terms such as “bucks” and “dough” for dollars.
In a Simpsons episode set in Australia, one character used the term ""dollarydoos"", which was later the subject of a failed petition to formally change the name of the Australian dollar.


=== Former denominations ===
Pre-decimal currency in Australia had a variety of slang terms for its various denominations. The Australian threepence was referred to as a ""trey"" or a ""trey bit"", a name probably derived from old French meaning three. The sixpence was often referred to as a ""zack"", which was an Australian and New Zealander term referring to a coin of small denomination, probably derived from Zecchino. The term was also used to refer to short prison term such as six months. An Australian shilling, like its British counterpart, was commonly referred to as a ""bob"", and the florin was consequently known as ""two bob"". Similarly, one Australian pound was colloquially described as a ""quid"", ""fiddly"", or ""saucepan"", the latter as rhyming slang for ""saucepan lid/quid"". The five-pound note could be referred to as a ""fiver"", or its derivatives, ""deep sea diver"" and ""sky diver"".
A number of post-decimal denominations which have since been discontinued had their own nicknames. The two-dollar note was known as the ""sick sheep"" in reference to its green colour and the merino ram that it showed. The paper (first and second series) hundred-dollar note was nicknamed the ""grey ghost"", ""grey nurse"", or the ""Bradman"" in recognition of its proximity to the 99.94 batting average of cricketer Sir Donald Bradman.


== Canada ==

In Canada, the one-dollar coin is known as the loonie. This is because it bears an image of the common loon, a bird.
The two-dollar coin is known as the toonie, a portmanteau combining the number two with loonie. It is occasionally spelled twonie; Canadian newspapers and the Royal Canadian Mint use the toonie spelling.
Similar to the United States, 5 cent coins are called nickels (due to the metal they are made from), 10 cent coins are dimes, 25 cent coins are quarters or two bits. Dollar amounts are all also referred to as bucks.
A five-dollar note is known colloquially as a fin, a fiver, half a sawbuck.
A ten-dollar note is known colloquially as a ten-spot, a dixie, a sawbuck, or a tenner.
A one hundred-dollar note is known colloquially as a C-Note or a bill (e.g. $500 is 5 bills).
Discontinued since 2000, the former one thousand-dollar notes were occasionally referred to as ""pinkies"", because of their distinctive colour.
Since Canadians and Americans both refer to their respective currencies as ""the dollar"", and because the two countries tend to mingle both socially and in the media, there is a lot of overlap in slang terms for money. However, this usually only extends to terms that are not specific to one country or the other. For example, both Canadians and Americans refer to a $100 note as a C-note, but an American might refer to it as a Benjamin, after its portrait of Benjamin Franklin, while a Canadian might refer to it as a Borden, after its portrait of Robert Borden.
In Canadian French, dollar amounts are often referred to as piasses in the same way that an English speaker would use the words ""buck"" or ""bucks"" in informal settings. The word piasse is derived from the word piastre.


== Czech Republic ==
A 5 Czech koruna (CZK) coin is called a bůr in Czech, the CZK 10 coin is called a pětka (lit. 'five'), the CZK 100 note is called a kilo – a reference to the kilogram, the CZK 500 note is called a pětibába (lit. 'five old woman') – a reference to the woman on its face, the CZK 1000 note is called a litr – a reference to the litre, and a sum of one million korunas is called a mega – a reference to the 106 SI unit prefix. If someone has a large amount of money, but the exact amount is not known, people say je ve vatě (lit. 'he is in cotton wool') or je v balíku (lit. 'he is in a package').


== Eurozone ==

Since its introduction in 1999, a number of slang terms for the euro have emerged, though differences between languages mean that they are not common across the whole of the eurozone. Some terms are inherited from the legacy currencies, such as quid from the Irish pound and various translations of fiver or tenner being used for notes. The German Teuro is a play on the word teuer, meaning 'expensive'. The Deutsche Mark by comparison was approximately worth half as much as the euro (at a ratio of 1.95583:1) and some grocers and restaurants have been accused of taking advantage of the smaller numbers to increase their actual prices with the changeover by rounding to 2:1, in Portugal the same has happened and usually use the term ""Aéreo"" with the meaning of ""Aéreal"", the currency that flies away. In Flanders the lower value copper coins are known as koper (copper) or rosse (~ginger, referring to the colour). Ege in Finland and Pavo (which is the usual Spanish translation of buck on movies or TV shows when it refers to dollars) in Spain are also terms applied to the euro. In France, the term ""balles"" must have been missed as it came back for ""Euro"" despite the difference in value (1€ = 6.56FrF).


== India ==
In India slang names for coins are more common than the currency notes. For 5 paisa (100 paisa is equal to 1 Indian rupee) it is panji. A 10 paisa coin is called dassi and for 20 paisa it is bissi. A 25 paisa coin is called chavanni (equal to 4 annas) and 50 paisa is athanni (8 annas). However, in recent years, due to inflation, the use of these small value coins has declined, and so has the use of these slang terms.


== Indonesia ==
In Indonesia, official term for money is uang, while the currency is rupiah (Rp). The common slang terms for money in Indonesia is called duit, which usually refer to paper money; and perak (from silver) for coin.
Apart from all that, there is cuan from Hokkien language brought by Chinese Indonesians ethnic group, which becomes more popular since the 2010s. However, before that there are Hokkien term for nominal money since the 20th century as follows:
Rp50: gocap; in coin (50 perak).
Rp100: cepek; in coin (100 perak).
Rp500: gopek; in coin (500 perak).
Rp1,000: seceng or ceceng; in coin (1000 perak).
Rp2,000: noceng.
Rp5,000: goceng.
Rp10,000: ceban.
Rp50,000: goban.
Rp100,000: cepekceng.
Rp500,000: gopekceng.
Rp1,000,000: cetiao.
Rp5,000,000: gotiao.


== Kenya ==
In Kenya there are about 42 different languages, which have different dialects and indigenous names for money, in addition to the official National languages of Swahili and English. In English, Kenyan currency is a Shilling while in Swahili it is ""Shilingi"". (Indeed, all East African countries refer to their money as Shillings.)
Other notable names include:

In addition, youth have a sub-culture street language for the different denominations. Using the street slang (sheng), urbanites often amalgamate Swahili, English, and their mother-tongue to concoct meanings and names for the different denominations. Among the commonly used terms are:

In writing, money is denoted by ""Kshs"" before or the slang notation ""/="" after. For examples, Kshs.1.00 is one-bob, whereas 5,000/= is five-Kei.
Corruption is rampant in the Kenyan government, and corrupt officials in government agencies often refer to illicit kickbacks as ""chickens"" to avoid anti-corruption and money laundering enforcement.


== Malaysia ==
States in Malaysia have different terms for money. Normally, ""cents"" are called ""sen"", but in the northern region (Penang, Kedah, Perlis) one ""kupang"" is 10 sen, thus 50 sen is ""5 kupang"". ""duit"" (pronounce ""do it"") means ""money"", such as in ""Saya tiada wang"" (""I have no money"").
In the East Coast Region (Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang), ""50 sen"" is replaced with ""samah"" (where ""se"" refer to one in Malay). RM 1 (100 sen) is called ""seya"" (""dua"" is two in Malay), and so on.
In Kelantan, ""ringgit"" is called ""riyal"". For example, RM 10 (10 ringgit) is called ""10 riyal"" in Kelantan.
In olden days, RM 10 was called ""Red Tiger"" because there was a watermark of tiger in a red tone on the RM 10 notes.


== Mexico ==
The mexican coin is called peso
0.5 MXN coin is called toston
10 MXN coin is called Diego
20 MXN bill is called Benito or Beny
200 MXN bill is called Juana
1000 MXN bill is called Miguelito
In general, money is referred to as ""lana"" (wool), ""varo"" or ""feria"" (change).

== New Zealand ==
In New Zealand one-dollar and two-dollar coins are often referred to as ""gold coins"". This presumably comes from the term ""gold coin donation"", which is widely used in New Zealand in schools on days such as mufti day, or as koha at a public event. 
A one-dollar coin is also simply known as a ""kiwi"", and the currency as a whole is known is banking and related industry circles as ""the Kiwi"" or ""the Kiwi dollar"".
Much like their use in other countries, the terms ""Fiver"" (and rarely ""an Edmund"" after the image of Sir Edmund Hillary on the note), ""Tenner"", ""Fiddy"", and ""Hundo"" are used for a five-dollar, ten-dollar, fifty-dollar, and hundred-dollar note respectively. As in other countries, a sum of $1000 is known as a ""grand"".
Prior to decimalisation in 1967, New Zealand slang terms for coins were largely identical to terms used in the United Kingdom and Australia.


== Russia ==
General money slang
Generally slang terms for money are following:
""b′abki"" — from Czech small anvil for making coins (""b′abka"", pl. ""b′abki""). Alternatively, the term may be derived from the literal meaning (""grandmas"") and refer to the image of Catherine the Great on imperial 100 rouble banknotes.
""babl′o"" — slang from ""b′abki""
""lav′ae"" — used since the 1990s, comes from gypsy word ""lavae"" means silver. Russian writer Victor Pelevin gives an alternative witty consumeristic meaning to this word. In his book ""Generation P"" he interprets ""lav′ae"" as a spelled out abbreviation ""LV"" which stands for liberal values.
""kap′u:sta"" — means cabbage
""derevy′anniy"" — a general name for a rouble, a substantive adj. ""wooden"". Means that rouble is cheap as it is made of wood.
Expressions
""strich bablo"" — verb ""strich"" means ""to cut"", ""to trim"" money like from the hedge (also ""strich kapu:stu"", ""strich lavae"")
""kos′it' babl′o"" — ""to mow money"" (also ""kos′it' kap′u:stu"", ""kos′it' lav′ae""), similar to ""trim money""
Both expressions mean to earn money in big amounts (usually refers to illegal ways) or to collect money from someone.
Coins
The Russian language has slang terms for various amounts of money. Slang names of copeck coins derive from old Russian pre-decimal coins and are rarely in use nowadays: an ""altyn"" is three copecks, a ""grivennik"" is ten copecks, a ""pyatialtynny"" (""five-altyns"") is fifteen copecks, and a ""dvugrivenny"" (""two-grivenniks"") is 20 copecks. Most of these coins are of Soviet mint and no longer used; only the ten copeck coin remains in circulation.
1 copeck — ""kop′eyechka"" (diminutive from copeck)
3 copecks — ""alt′yn""
10 copecks — ""gr′ivennik""
15 copecks — ""pyatialt′ynny"" (""five-altyns"")
20 copecks — ""dvugr′ivenny"" (""two-grivenniks"")
Bills
The word ""cherv′onets"" means ten rubles and refers to an early 20th-century gold coin of the same name. It is also called ""ch′irik"" (a diminutive for ""cherv′onets""). The words for bank notes from 50 to 1000 rubles are the newest and most modern, since currently (2000s-2010s) bank notes of this value are most common in circulation. 50 rubles are called ""polt′innik"" (an old word that originally meant 50 copecks), 100 rubles are called ""st′ol'nik"" (a neologism from the Russian word ""sto"", meaning ""100"", not related to the Muscovite office of the same name), 500 rubles are called ""pyatih′atka"" (lit. ""five huts""), ""fiol′et"" (""violet"", because of the note's color), and 1000 rubles are called ""sht′u:ka"" (means ""item"", ""pack"" — 1990-s slang for a pack of bills 100x10RUB or 100x10USD), ""kus′ok"" (""piece"", ""pack"" — also refers to a 100x10RUB pack); or ""kos′ar'"" — (form ""k′oso"" — adv. ""aslope"") initially refers to a fact that in the 1910–20s the number ""1000"" was printed on the note at 45°. The word ""kos′ar'"" (homonymic meaning is ""mower"") can also be referred to another money slang expression ""kos′it' babl′o"" — ""to mow money"" — to earn money in big amounts (usually refers to illegal ways).
10 RUB — ""cherv′onets"" (from Slav. ""cherv′oniy"" — red, refer to a colour the note was in Soviet times), ""ch′irik"" (a diminutive for chervonets)
50 RUB — ""polt′innik"" (substantive from ""five-altyns"")
100 RUB — ""stol'nik"", ""s′o:tka"", ""sot′el"" (informal substantives from ""sto"" — one hundred)
500 RUB — ""pyatis′otka""(substantive from ""pyat's′ot"" — five hundred), ""pyatih′utka"" (lit. ""five huts"")"", ""fiol′et"" (""violet"" refers to a note colour), ""pieh'ota"" (derivative from ""pyat's'ot"" with original word meaning infantry)
1000 RUB — ""sht′u:ka"", ""shtu:k′ar'"" (""item"", ""pack"" — 1990-s slang for a pack of bills 100x10RUB or 100x10USD)"", ""kus′ok"" (""piece"", ""pack"" — also refers to a 100x10RUB pack); ""kos′ar'"" (""slopped""), ""rubl'""
5000 RUB – ""pit′orka"", ""pit′ora"" (""a fiver""), ""pyat' shtuk"" (five packs, five packs of 100x10RUB), ""pyat' kosar′ey"", ""pyat' kusk′o:v"", ""pyat' rubl'ey""

Slang words for greater amounts of money originate from the 1990s and the Russian Civil War eras, when the ruble was suffering hyperinflation. For a million rubles the most common are ""limon"" (lemon), ""lyam"" (short from ""limon"") and for a billion ""arbuz"" (watermelon).
Word ""limon"" appeared in the 1990s when rouble lost its value.
1 000 000 RUB — ""lim′o:n"" (lemon), ""lyam"" (short from ""limon"")
1 000 000 000 RUB — ""yard"" (milliard), ""arb′u:z"" (watermelon)


== Slovakia ==

From 1993 to 2008, Slovakia used its own currency, slovenská koruna (Slovak crown), instead of Euro. During this period, slang words for greater amounts of money were established, including ""kilo"" (slang for kilogram) for one hundred crowns, ""liter"" (liter) for one thousand crowns and ""melón"" (melon) for one million crowns. These slang words are still used after 2008, albeit less frequently.


== South Africa ==
Decimal currency was introduced in 1961, when the South African pound, previously based on the United Kingdom currency, was replaced by the rand (symbol R) at the rate of 2 rand to 1 pound, or 10 shillings to the rand. Thus the United Kingdom term ""bob"" for a shilling equates to 10 cents.
South African slang for various amounts of money borrows many terms from the rest of the English speaking world, such as the word ""grand"" when referring to R1,000. Other words are unique to South Africa, such as the term ""choc"" when referring to a R20 note. One ""bar"" refers to an amount of R1,000,000.
Among the English speaking communities ""Bucks"" is commonly used to refer to Rands (South African Currency). Less commonly used is the Afrikaans slang for Rands which is ""Bokke"", the plural of Bok; The Afrikaans word for antelope (""Bucks"" being the English equivalent), derived from the Springbok image on the old R 1 coin. e.g. R 100 = 100 Bucks/Bokke, R 5 = 5 Bucks/Bokke etc.


== Sweden ==
In Sweden money in general is colloquially referred to by the words stålar, kosing, deg (""dough"") or older klöver (""clover"") and the English loanword cash. With Rinkeby Swedish and the Swedish hip hop scene para has been introduced. It is a loanword from Serbo-Croat-Bosnian and Turkish, originating from the Ottoman currency para. Slang terms for the Swedish krona in use today include spänn and bagis. Riksdaler (referring riksdaler, the former Swedish currency) is still used as a colloquial term for the krona in Sweden. A 20-kronor banknote is sometimes called selma, referring to the portrait of Selma Lagerlöf on the older version of the note.


== United Kingdom ==

Ready money (i.e. cash) has been referred to in the United Kingdom as ""dosh"" since at least 1953; Brewer equates this term with ""paying through the nose"", dosh being a Russian-Jewish prefix referring to the nose, that is, paying in cash. The phrase ""ready money"" has also given rise to the far more popular ""readies"", though there is debate as to whether this is an obvious reference to the availability of the currency or the red and white colour of the British ten shilling Treasury note of 1914. The related term ""cash on the nail"" is said to refer to 17th century trading stands in Bristol and elsewhere, over which deals were done and cash changed hands. Other general terms for money include ""bread"" (Cockney rhyming slang 'bread & honey', money; this also became dough, by derivation from the same root), ""cabbage"", ""clam"", ""milk"", ""dosh"", ""dough"", ""shillings"", ""frogskins"", ""notes"", ""ducats"", ""loot"", ""bones"", ""bar"", ""coin"", ""folding stuff"", ""honk"", ""lampshade"", ""lolly"", ""lucre""/""filthy lucre"", ""p"",
""moola/moolah"", ""mazuma"", ""paper"", ""scratch"", ""readies"", ""rhino"" (Thieves' cant), ""spondulicks/spondoolic(k)s/spondulix/spondoolies"" and ""wonga"".
Quid (singular and plural) is used for pound sterling or £, in British slang. It is thought to derive from the Latin phrase ""quid pro quo"". A pound (£1) may also be referred to as a ""nicker"" or ""nugget"" (rarer).

Some other pre-decimal United Kingdom coins or denominations became commonly known by colloquial and slang terms, perhaps the most well known being ""bob"" for a shilling. A farthing was a ""mag"", three farthings was ""the sun, moon and stars"" (three far things...), a silver threepence was a ""joey"" and the later nickel-brass threepence was called a ""thruppenny bit"" (,  or ); a sixpence was a ""tanner"", the two-shilling coin or florin was a ""two-bob bit"", the two shillings and sixpence coin or half-crown was a ""half dollar"" and the crown was a ""dollar"". Slang terms are not generally used for the decimal coins that replaced them but in some parts of the country, ""bob"" continues to represent one-twentieth of a pound, that is five new pence and two bob is 10p. For all denominations ""p"" is used for pence.
In the United Kingdom the term ""shrapnel"" may be used for an inconvenient pocketful of change because of the association with a shrapnel shell and ""wad"", ""wedge"" or ""wodge"" for a bundle of banknotes, with ""tightwad"" a derogatory term for someone who is reluctant to spend money. Similar to ""shrapnel"" the use of ""washers"" in Scotland denotes a quantity of low value coinage. Quantities of UK 1p and 2p coins may be referred to as ""Copper"", 5p, 10p, 20p, and 50p coins as ""Silver"" and £1 and £2 coins as ""Bronze"" due to their colour and apparent base metal type. ""Brass"" is northern English slang for any amount of money.
The one pound note, while still in circulation in Scotland, was occasionally referred to as a ""Sheet"" and thus the ten shilling note as a ""Half Sheet"". More commonly the ten shilling note was a ""ten bob note"" or, in London, ""half a bar"". ""As bent as a nine bob note"" is or was a common colloquial phrase used to describe something or someone crooked or counterfeit, or alternatively (and now considered offensive) a gay man who is extremely camp.
In pub culture five and ten pound notes are sometimes called ""blue beer tokens"" and ""brown beer tokens"" respectively.
Many of the following are largely obsolete, or otherwise not in common use.
£5 is commonly called a ""fiver"", and more rarely a ""Lady"" (short for ""Lady Godiva"") due to rhyming slang or a ""Deep Sea Diver"" or a ""Winston"" from the image of Winston Churchill on the back of the new note introduced in 2016
£10 is commonly known as a ""tenner"" or, more uncommonly, a ""Darwin"", due to the image of Charles Darwin on the back (issued from 7 November 2000 and withdrawn from circulation on 1 March 2018). Other terms used are a ""Cockle"" from Cock and Hen — ten and ""Ayrton"", from Ayrton Senna i.e. tenner.
£15 is sometimes referred to as a Commodore as it is worth three ""Ladies"" (see above) after The Commodores song Three Times a Lady.
£20 is sometimes referred to as a ""score"", although strictly this is not a slang term for money, as 'score' is a normal word for twenty. £20 is sometimes known as a ""Bobby"" from Bobby Moore (rhymes with score).
£25 is known as a ""pony"".
£50 is known as a ""bullseye"" (from the points value of the bullseye on a darts board).
£100 is sometimes referred to as a ""ton"" e.g. £400 would be called 4 ton. Also, a ""century"" or a ""bill"" have been used for this value.
£500 is known as a ""monkey""
£1,000 is commonly referred to as a grand, e.g., £4,000 would be called 4 grand, or rarely in certain dialects as a ""bag"" (from the rhyming slang ""Bag of Sand""). In some cases, £1,000 is known as one large, i,e., £10,000 would be ten large. 
£2,000 has been known as an Archer, having been coined by Rik Mayall's character Alan B'stard in TV comedy The New Statesman.
In recent years, many dialects have opted to use other terms for large amounts of money.
£100 is commonly known as a bag.
£1,000 is commonly known as a rack.
However, it is not out of the question that these definitions could be switched around. Context matters greatly in UK Slang.
A ""oner"" (one-er) has referred to various amounts from one shilling to a pound, to now meaning £100 or £1,000, and a ""big one"" denoting £1,000. A ""oncer"" referred particularly to a one-pound note, now defunct.
In London financial culture, a billion pounds or, more often, US dollars, is referred to as a 'yard'. This derives from the old British English word for a thousand million, a milliard, which has now been replaced by the 'short scale' name 'billion' from US English. The term 'million' for a million pounds or dollars is often dropped when it is clear from context. E.g. ""He made three quid last year"" would mean ""He earned three million pounds"".


== United States ==
Common slang terms for money in general:

Common slang terms specifically denoting $1,000 U.S. Dollars:

Older-fashioned, but still widely known terms:

U.S. coinage nicknames reflect their value, composition and tradition.

The one-cent coin ($0.01 or 1¢) is commonly called a penny due to historical comparison with the British penny. Older U.S. pennies, prior to 1982, are sometimes called ""coppers"" due to being made of 95% copper. Pennies dated 1909–1958, displaying wheat stalks on the reverse, are sometimes called ""wheaties"" or ""wheat-backs"", while 1943 steel wheat cents are sometimes nicknamed ""steelies"".
The five-cent coin ($0.05 or 5¢) is commonly called a nickel due to being made of 25% nickel since 1866. Nickels minted between 1942 and 1945 are nicknamed 'war nickels' owing to their different metal content, removing the nickel for a mixture of silver, copper and manganese.
The dime coin ($0.10 or 10¢) is worth ten cents.
The quarter coin ($0.25 or 25¢) is worth twenty-five cents. A quarter used to be called two-bits (see below), but this is falling out of use.
The half ($0.50 or 50¢) is worth fifty cents.
Dimes and quarters used to be sometimes collectively referred to as ""silver"" due to their historic composition of 90% silver prior to 1965.
A bit is an antiquated term equal to one eighth of a dollar or 12+1⁄2 cents, after the Spanish 8-Real ""piece of eight"" coin on which the U.S. dollar was initially based. So ""two bits"" is twenty-five cents; similarly, ""four bits"" is fifty cents. More rare are ""six bits"" (75 cents) and ""eight bits"" meaning a dollar. These are commonly referred to as two-bit, four-bit, six-bit and eight-bit.
U.S. banknote nicknames reflect their values (such as five, twenty, etc.), the subjects depicted on them and their color.

$1 bill is sometimes called a ""single"", a ""buck"", a ""simoleon"" or rarely an ""ace"". The dollar has also been referred to as a ""bean"" or ""bone"" (e.g. twenty bones is equal to $20).
$2 bill is sometimes referred to as a ""deuce"".
$5 bill has been referred to as an ""Abe"", ""fin"", ""fiver"" or ""five-spot"".
$10 bill is a ""sawbuck"", a ""ten-spot"", or a ""Hamilton"".
$20 bill as a ""Jackson"", or a ""dub"", or a ""double sawbuck"".
Among horse-race gamblers, the $50 bill is called a ""frog"" and is considered unlucky. It is sometimes referred to as a ""Grant"".
$100 bill is occasionally a ""band"" or ""C-note"" (C being the Roman numeral for 100, from the Latin word centum) or ""century note""; it's more commonly referred to as a ""Benjamin"" or ""Benny"" (after Benjamin Franklin, who is pictured on the note), or a ""yard"" (so $300 is ""3 yards"" and a $50 bill is a ""half a yard""). ""A stack"" is $1,000 in the form of ten $100 bills, banded by a bank or otherwise.
Amounts above 1000 US dollars are occasionally referred to as ""large"" (""twenty large"" being $20,000, etc.). In slang, a thousand dollars may also be referred to as a ""grand"" or ""G"", ""K"" (as in kilo), or less commonly a ""stack"", a ""bozo"", as well as a ""band"" . For example, ""The repairs to my car cost me a couple grand"" or ""The repairs to my car cost me a couple [of] stacks"".
1,000 US dollars is called a ""rack"", or rarely, a ""d-note"".
10,000 US dollars is called a ""stack"".
100,000 US dollars is called a ""brick"" or a ""honey bun"".
Banknotes may be collectively referred to as ""dead Presidents"", although neither Alexander Hamilton ($10) nor Benjamin Franklin ($100) was President. These are also referred to as ""wallet-sized portraits of Presidents"" – referring to the fact that people typically carry pictures in their wallets.

""Greenback"" originally applied specifically to the 19th century Demand Note dollars created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the costs of the American Civil War for the North. The original note was printed in black and green on the back side. It is still used to refer to the U.S. dollar (but not to the dollars of other countries).
Other more general terms for money, not specifically linked to actual banknotes:

Monetary units larger than 1 dollar are often referred to by the names of their coin counterparts: $5 is a ""nickel"", $10 is a ""dime"", and $25 is a ""quarter"".
A one hundred dollar bill can also be called a buck, or a ""dollar"", but since a buck is also used for one dollar, the context needs to be clear (this continues the pattern of referring to values by the coin counterpart).
A ""hoka"" is used to express a large sum of money, usually between ten thousand and fifty thousand dollars.
A million dollars is sometimes called a ""closet"" or a ""rock"", popularized by several TV shows and movies. On The Sopranos: in one episode Tony Soprano states, ""So adjusting for inflation I'm looking at half a rock?"" In a separate episode, Soprano states: ""This whole thing is going to cost me close to a rock."" Another slang term for a million dollars is an ""M"", as used in rap songs. Financial institutions and applications will often use ""MM"" when writing shorthand for a million dollars, as a million is the product of the Roman numeral ""M"" (1000) times itself. More common usage is a ""mil"".
A ""yard"" is a financial term for one billion dollars, deriving from the French word of the same meaning, ""milliard"", pronounced 'meel-yard'.

Tourism improvement district,"Tourism Improvement Districts (TIDs) are a type of business improvement district in the United States. The aim of TIDs is increasing the number of overnight visitors using business and services in that area. TIDs are formed through a public–private partnership between the local government and the businesses in a district. TID funds are usually managed by a nonprofit corporation, generally a Convention and Visitors' Bureau, hotel association, or similar destination marketing organization. Typical TID services include marketing programs to raise awareness of the destination, sponsorship of special events that attract overnight visitors, and sales programs to bring in large-group business. Synonymous terms for TIDs include: tourism marketing district, hotel improvement district, and tourism business improvement district.


== Tourism Improvement Districts by US States ==


=== California ===
In California, tourism improvement districts are formed under the Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994, the Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of 1989, or a similar enabling ordinance adopted by a charter city. California districts are also subject to other laws designed to ensure approval by business owners paying the assessment and accountability by the managing body to those business owners.
Tourism improvement districts are formed with a majority of assessed businesses consenting and the local government's approval. Funds raised are returned to a non-profit corporation which is under contract with the local government to manage those funds. Several accountability mechanisms ensure that funds are spent in accordance with a specifically defined district plan that includes marketing and sales programs approved by the businesses paying into the district. The two main reasons for TIDs' growing popularity among tourism-related businesses are:

Funds cannot be spent on programs that don't benefit the businesses paying the assessment
Funds cannot be diverted by the government for other programs
As of November 2010, there were over 91 known local tourism improvement districts in California, including:

San Diego Tourism Marketing District
Napa Valley Tourism Improvement District
Sacramento County Tourism Improvement District
Marin County Tourism Improvement District
South Lake Tahoe Tourism Business Improvement District
San Jose Hotel Business Improvement Area
Santa Barbara South Coast Tourism Business Improvement District
Long Beach Tourism Business Improvement Area
Del Mar Tourism Business Improvement District
Newport Beach Tourism Improvement District
Monterey County Tourism Improvement District
Mendocino County Lodging Business Improvement District
Oceanside Tourism Marketing District
Most districts encompass either a city or county, although some include multiple cities or a county and the cities within it. California's first tourism improvement district was formed in West Hollywood in 1992. The recent tourism improvement district was formed in Santa Barbara in September, 2010. California's tourism improvement districts range from small 5-hotel community districts to major cities with several hundred hotels and its budget ranges from $100,000 to over $30 million.
One of California's most noticeable tourism improvement districts is the San Diego Tourism Marketing District. The district funded the hugely popular “Happy Happens” advertising campaign. The San Diego Tourism Marketing District funds many programs and events designed to bring overnight visitors to San Diego, including Comic Con and the Holiday Bowl.
A lawsuit filed in 2012 by San Diegans for Open Government challenges the renewal of the San Diego Tourism Marketing District. The lawsuit filed by Cory Briggs, a public interest lawyer, claims that the assessment is basically a tax and therefore is not valid under California proposition 26 which requires a two-thirds supermajority to pass any tax. In January 2016 the judge sided with San Diegans for Open Government that the nonprofit has legal standing to pursue the case. The case now moves on to be argued on the merits of the lawsuit.


=== Montana ===
In Montana, upon a petition by owners of 60% of the businesses in the district, a municipality may begin the district formation process by adopting a resolution of intention. There is a 15-day period in which owners may protest formation of the district, and the municipality must hold public hearings on the proposed district. A 5-7 member board of trustees is appointed to manage the district.


=== Nevada ===
In 2005, Nevada passed a tourism improvement district law. Under the law, the governing body of a municipality may create a tourism improvement district for the purposes of carrying out the law and without any election can acquire, improve, equip, operate and maintain a project within such district. Proceeds from certain state and local sales tax generated within the district can be used to finance the project.


=== Washington State ===
Washington's Tourism Promotion Areas Law requires submission of petitions from business owners who will pay 60% or more of the proposed assessment. Only lodging businesses with forty or more units can be included in the tourism promotion area. Upon receipt of petitions, the municipality must adopt a resolution of intention and hold public hearings on the proposed promotion area. An advisory board or commission may be appointed, or a destination marketing organization may be designated to manage the district funds.

Knocking on wood,"Knocking on wood (also phrased touching wood or touch wood) is an apotropaic tradition of literally touching, tapping, or knocking on wood, or merely stating that one is doing or intending to do so, in order to avoid ""tempting fate"" after making a favorable prediction or boast, or a declaration concerning one's own death or another unfavorable situation.


== Origin of use in the English language ==
There are connections between ancient spirituality and trees influencing fortune. In the pre-Christian beliefs of the Germanic peoples, for example, three Norns send fate up into the universe through a tree. Languages descended from these peoples include concepts such as ""knock on wood"", ""touch wood"" or ""three times wood"", although only the first two expressions are in the descended English language specifically. Meanwhile, the ancient Celtic peoples also believed that the act of touching wood called on spirits or gods of the trees. Christians tie the practice to the symbolism of the wood of the cross of crucifixion. Folklore researcher Steve Roud suggests that the widespread, modern use however derives from a form of tag called ""Tiggy Touchwood"" in which players are safe from being tagged if they are touching wood.


== Similar traditions across the world ==

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Serbia there is also the habit of knocking on wood when saying something positive or affirmative about someone or something and not wanting that to change. Frequently the movement of knocking on nearby wood is followed by da kucnem u drvo / да куцнем у дрво (""I will knock on wood""), or sometimes by da ne ureknem / да не урекнем (""I don't want to jinx it"").
In Brazil and Portugal, bater na madeira (""knock on wood"") is done physically; three knocks are required after giving an example of a bad thing eventually happening. No verbalization is required, just the three knocks on the closest piece or object of wood. In the absence of wood, someone can say bate na madeira, to prevent the bad thing to happen. People do not actually believe knocking three times on a piece of wood will really protect them, but it is a social habit and it is polite to do so to demonstrate that one doesn't want that bad thing one is talking about to actually happen.
In Bulgaria the superstition of ""knock on wood"" (чукам на дърво chukam na dǎrvo) is reserved for protection against the evil, and is not typically used for attracting good luck. Usually people engage in the practice in reaction to bad news, actual or merely imagined. In most cases the nearest wooden object is used (in some areas, however, tables are exempt); if there are no such objects within immediate reach, a common tongue-in-cheek practice is to knock on one's head. Knocking on wood is often followed by lightly pulling one's earlobe with the same hand. Common phrases to accompany the ritual are ""God guard us"" (Бог да ни пази Bog da ni pazi) and ""may the Devil not hear"" (да не чуе Дяволът da ne chue Djavolǎt).
In Denmark the saying is 7, 9, 13 / syv, ni, tretten (usually accompanied by knocking under a table), as these numbers have traditionally been associated with magic.
In Egypt, إمسك الخشب emsek el-khashab (""hold the wood"") is said when mentioning either good luck one has had in the past or hopes one has for the future. When referring to past good luck the expression is usually used in hopes of the good thing continuing to occur via its spoken acknowledgment, as well as preventing envy.
In modern-day England the expression ""touch wood"" is more commonly heard than ""knock on wood"".
In Georgia, a ხეზე დაკაკუნება kheze daḳaḳuneba (""knocking on wood"") is performed when one mentions a bad possibility that could take place in future. Usually the person knocks three times. It is also done when one experiences a bad omen.
In Germany, one finds the expressions ""knock on wood"" and ""three times wood"" Dreimal Holz.
In Greece the saying χτύπα ξύλο chtýpa xýlo (""knock on wood"") is said when hearing someone say something negative in order to prevent it from happening.
In Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, when someone is saying bad things, the one that hears it would knock on wood (or other suitable surface) and knock on their forehead while saying amit-amit or amit-amit jabang bayi (Indonesia), choi or tak cun tak cun (Malaysia).
In Iran,  when one says something good about something or somebody, they might knock on wood and say بزنم به تخته چشم نخوره bezan-am be taxteh, cheshm naxoreh (""[I] am knocking on wood to prevent [them]/it from being jinxed""). The evil eye and the concept of being jinxed are common phobias and superstitious beliefs in Iranian culture, and Iranians traditionally believe knocking on wood wards off evil spirits.
In Israel the saying בלי עין הרע‎ b'lí 'áyin hará' (""without the evil eye"") is said when someone mentions good things happening to themselves or someone else, or even when mentioning a valuable thing they own. This expression is a superstition that is used in the hope that a good thing will continue to occur even after it is mentioned, and as a way to prevent envy (hasad حسد) also known as the Evil Eye, as they believe that envy can harm other people. Ashkenazi Jews around the world use the Yiddish equivalent  קיין עין־הרע‎ keyn eyn hore (or a contracted form קינעהאָרע‎ kinehore), followed by imitating spitting three times, as in Assam and Russia.
In Italy, tocca ferro (""touch iron"") is used, especially after seeing an undertaker or something related to death.
In Catalonia, tocar ferro (""to touch iron"") is used, meaning protecting yourself against bad luck.
In Latin America, it is also tradition to physically knock a wooden object. A variant requires that the object does not have feet (tocar madera sin patas), which rules out chairs, tables and beds.
In Lebanon and Syria the saying دقّ عالخشب duqq ‘al-khashab (""knock on [the] wood"") is said when hearing someone say something negative in order to prevent it from happening. It is also largely observed when saying something positive or affirmative about someone or something and not wanting that to change.
In North Macedonia, ""knocking on wood"" is a folk belief and people usually do that after someone says something bad to make sure nothing bad happens.
In Norway the saying is bank i bordet (""knock on the table""), which usually was made of wood.
In Poland, there is a habit of knocking on (unpainted) wood (which may be preceded by saying odpukać w niemalowane drewno; or simply odpukać; – literally meaning ""to knock on unpainted wood"") when saying something negative – to prevent it from happening – or, more rarely, something positive – in order not to ""spoil it"". In the Czech Republic, this is often accompanied for stronger effect by knocking on one's teeth, a piece of building stone, or metal, reasoning that these (as opposed to wood) survive even fire.
In Romania, there is also a superstition that one can avoid bad things aforementioned by literally knocking on wood (Romanian: a bate în lemn). Wood tables are exempted. One of the possible reasons could be that there is a monastery practice to call people to pray by playing / knocking the simantron.
In Spain tocar madera and in France toucher du bois (""to touch wood"") is something that you say when you want your luck or a good situation to continue, e.g. Ha ido bien toda la semana y, toco madera, seguirá bien el fin de semana (""It's been good all week and, touching wood, the weekend will stay good"").
In Sweden, a common expression is ""pepper, pepper, touch wood"" (peppar, peppar, ta i trä), referring to throwing pepper over one's shoulder and touching a wooden object.
In Turkey, when someone hears about a bad experience someone else had, they may gently pull one earlobe, and knock on wood twice, which means ""God save me from that thing"".
In the United States in the eighteenth century, men used to knock on the wood stock of their muzzle-loading rifles to settle the black powder charge, ensuring the weapon would fire cleanly.
In Vietnam a common expression is ""trộm vía"". It is said when a speaker wants the good/positive aforementioned thing will continue, especially when saying some good things about a newborn because they believe if they did not say the words, negative things would happen later.
In Assam in Northeast India as well as in Russia, the expression ""thu thu thu"" – the onomatopoeic phrase to represent the sound of spitting – is used after making a favourable prediction or commenting on an ongoing favourable occurrence in order to deter misfortune befalling these favourable circumstances. Its use is similar to the use of the phrase ""touchwood"" in Western traditions.
In Russia, Estonia and Ukraine, ""Постучать по дереву"" (""to knock on wood"") has the same meaning. There is also an expression ""Тфу тфу тфу"" (""Tfu Tfu Tfu"") phrase to represent the sound of spitting similar with Assam in Northeast India. The difference, however, is that the person would have to ""spit"" with his head turned to the left shoulder which represents ""spitting away"" bad fortune because it is situated on the left (unstable) side of life.


== In Popular Culture ==


=== Music ===
The song The Impression That I Get by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones features the lyric ""I never had to knock on wood / but I know someone who has / which makes me wonder if I could"" referring to warding off the bad luck of tragic events.

Stele,"A stele is a stone or wooden slab, mostly taller than it is wide, that is built so that people will remember something when they look at it. Mostly it is decorated with the names and titles of the person that is a reminder of. This is inscribed, carved in relief or painted onto the slab.


== History and function ==
Stelae were also used as territorial markers, as the boundary stelae of Akhenaten at Amarna, or to commemorate military victories. They were widely used in Mesopotamia, Greece, Egypt, Ethiopia, and, quite independently, in China and some Buddhist cultures, and by Mesoamerican civilisations, especially the Olmec and Maya. The huge number of stelae that survive from ancient Egypt and in Central America are one of the largest and most significant sources of information on those civilisations.
Unfinished standing stones, set up without inscriptions from Libya in North Africa to Scotland were monuments of pre-literate Megalithic cultures in the Late Stone Age.
An obelisk is a specialized kind of stele. The Celtic high crosses of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales are specialized stelae.The totem pole of North and South America is a type of stelae.  Gravestones are also kinds of stelae.
In 2004 the architect Peter Eisenman created a field of some 2,700 blank stelae, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin to memory of the Holocaust.

Lockman Hole,"The Lockman Hole is an area of the sky which is like a clear window into far distant space.
From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, most directions are partly blocked or obscured by  H I clouds of neutral hydrogen. These glow faintly with infrared light and obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths.  
The H I clouds interfere with observations at those wavelengths in nearly all other directions. So the Lockman Hole is an attractive area of the sky for observational astronomy surveys. It is near the pointer stars of the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major.  is about 15 square degrees in size, and is named after its discoverer, astronomer Jay Lockman.

Hardwood,"Hardwood is wood from deciduous trees and broad-leaf evergreen trees.  All hardwoods are angiosperms (flowering plants), the largest group of land plants.
Hardwood is contrasted to softwood, which comes from conifers, cone bearing seed plants. Hardwoods are not always harder than softwoods, balsa wood being an example of this. Hardwood trees are more varied than softwoods and there are about 100 times more species of hardwood than there are softwoods. Hardwoods usually have broad leaves. Hardwoods all have enclosed nuts or seeds, where softwoods are gymnosperms, naked seed plants.leis

Each species of hardwood has its own set of properties, however they have some properties in common. Hardwoods normally have broad leaves and come from deciduous or broad-leafed evergreen trees. Hardwoods grow slower than softwoods. Evergreen softwoods grow faster than deciduous hardwoods, and can grow to a larger size. Some hardwoods are excellent for carving. One of the hardest hardwoods is black ironwood which is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest wood. Ironwoods are so dense that they sink in water rather than float as other woods do.
The properties of the wood are caused by its structure. Hardwoods have a denser structure, which is the reason they are usually harder and heavier. Hardwood has xylem vessels which are used to transport water. Their cell walls are strongly lignified: lignin is a hard material used to support plants above the surface. The quantity of lignin is probably the main factor in their hardness.
Softwoods have a vascular structure which looks similar to a bunch of drinking straws held together. They also have lignin, but of a slightly different type, and less of it than most hardwoods.


== Species of hardwood ==
Common species of hardwood found in the USA, and Europe. Many species are also found in other areas of the world. This is not a complete list of all hardwood trees. 


== Uses of hardwood ==

The use of hardwood is much reduced in the modern world. The destruction of tropical and temperate forests has made it expensive and scarce. Many things once made of hardwood are now made of ceramics, plastic or softwood.
Hardwoods are often used to make items that get used a lot because of their density.  These items include furniture, flooring, and utensils.  They are also used in construction. Hardwoods are also less likely to decay or rot than softwoods. Furniture made by hardwood joinery is more expensive than that made from softwoods.
Utensils for use in preparing food can include things such as the vessel in the gallery below used by the Ede people to grind corn and grains for food. Other utensils include: spoons, chopsticks, bowls, plates and cups. Because of the dense nature of the wood used such a vessel can be used for many years without breaking. Other examples include the handle of the Luzon knife seen in the gallery. Because of the nature of sound transmission provide a good wood for musical instruments such as violins, guitars, pianos and hand drums such as the Djembe drum pictured in the gallery below.
Flooring is often made of hardwood because it can stand up to years of people walking on it with their shoes. An example is the flooring made from tiger-wood seen in the gallery below. Hardwoods are also used to make wood veneers to glue over other, cheaper woods, making them less expensive than solid hardwood while still giving them the appearance of a particular species of wood. This has become a common way of using tropical hardwoods that have a limited supply of trees due to deforestation occurring in many tropical countries. In Europe, hardwoods account for 29% and softwoods 71% of wood consumption. Hardwood has very short fibers about 1mm in length and is so also used to make fine paper such as writing paper, tissue, and printing paper. Paper with longer fibers such as paper bags, cardboard and shipping containers is made of softwoods.

Limiting oxygen concentration,"The limiting oxygen concentration (LOC), also known as the minimum oxygen concentration (MOC), is defined as the limiting concentration of oxygen below which combustion is not possible, independent of the concentration of fuel.  It is expressed in units of volume percent of oxygen.  The LOC varies with pressure and temperature.  It is also dependent on the type of inert (non-flammable) gas.

Limiting oxygen concentration for solid materials

The effect of increasing the concentration of inert gas can be understood by viewing the inert as thermal ballast that quenches the flame temperature to a level below which the flame cannot exist.  Carbon dioxide is therefore more effective than nitrogen due to its higher molar heat capacity.
The concept has important practical use in fire safety engineering.  For instance, to safely fill a new container or a pressure vessel with flammable gases, the atmosphere of normal air (containing 20.9 volume percent of oxygen) in the vessel would first be flushed (purged) with nitrogen or another non-flammable inert gas, thereby reducing the oxygen concentration inside the container.  When the oxygen concentration is below the LOC, flammable gas can then be safely admitted to the vessel, because the possibility of internal explosion has been eliminated.
The limiting oxygen concentration is a necessary parameter when designing hypoxic air fire prevention systems.

Pit (botany),"Pits are relatively thinner portions of the cell wall that adjacent cells can communicate or exchange fluid through. Pits are characteristic of cell walls with secondary layers. Generally each pit has a complementary pit opposite of it in the neighboring cell. These complementary pits are called ""pit pairs"".
Pits are composed of three parts: the pit chamber, the pit aperture, and the pit membrane. The pit chamber is the hollow area where the secondary layers of the cell wall are absent. The pit aperture is the opening at either end of the pit chamber. The pit membrane is the primary cell wall and middle lamella, or the membrane between adjacent cell walls, at the middle of the pit chamber.
The primary cell wall at the pit membrane may also have depressions similar to the pit depressions of the secondary layers. These depressions are primary pit-fields, or primary pits. In the primary pit, the primordial pit provides an interruption in the primary cell wall that the plasmodesmata can cross. The primordial pit is the only aperture in the otherwise continuous primary cell wall.
Pit pairs are a characteristic feature of xylem, as sap flows through the pits of xylem cells.


== Types of pits ==

Though pits are usually simple and complementary, a few more pit variations can be formed:

Simple pits: A pit pair in which the diameter of the pit chamber and the diameter of the pit aperture are equal.
Bordered pits: A pit pair in which the pit chamber is over-arched by the cell wall, creating a larger pit chamber and smaller pit aperture.
Half bordered pits: A pit pair in which a bordered pit has a complementary simple pit. Such a pit pair is called half bordered pit pair.
Blind pits: A pit pair in which a simple pit has no complementary pit.
Compound pits: A pit pair in which one cell wall has a large pit and the adjacent cell wall has numerous small pits.


== Plasmodesmata ==

Plasmodesmata are thin sections of the endoplasmic reticulum that traverse pits and connect adjacent cells. These sections provide an avenue of transport through the pits and facilitate communication. Plasmodesmata are not restricted to pits however, as plasmodesmata often cross a cell wall of constant width and occasionally the cell wall is even wider in areas where plasmodesmata traverse it.


== Torus and margo ==

The torus and margo are characteristic features of bordered pit-pairs in gymnosperms, such as Coniferales, Ginkgo, and Gnetales. In other vascular plants, the torus is rare. The pit membrane is separated into two parts: a thick impermeable torus at the center of the pit membrane, and the permeable margo surrounding it. The torus regulates the functions of the bordered pit, and the margo is a cell wall-derived porous membrane that supports the torus. The margo is composed of bundles of microfibrils that radiate from the torus.
The margo is flexible and can move towards either side of the pit while under stress. This allows the thick, impermeable torus to block the pit aperture. When the torus is displaced so that it blocks the pit aperture, the pit is said to be aspirated.

Herm (sculpture),"A herma (Ancient Greek: ἑρμῆς, plural ἑρμαῖ hermai), commonly herm in English, is a sculpture with a head and perhaps a torso above a plain, usually squared lower section, on which male genitals may also be carved at the appropriate height. Hermae were so called either because the head of Hermes was most common or from their etymological connection with the Greek word ἕρματα (érma, meaning 'blocks of stone'), which originally had no reference to Hermes at all. The form originated in ancient Greece, and was adopted by the Romans (called mercuriae), and revived at the Renaissance in the form of term figures and atlantes.


== Origin ==
In the earliest times Greek divinities were worshipped in the form of a heap of stones or a shapeless column of stone or wood. In many parts of Greece there were piles of stones by the sides of roads, especially at their crossings, and on the boundaries of lands. The religious respect paid to such heaps of stones, especially at the meeting of roads, is shown by the custom of each passer-by throwing a stone on to the heap or anointing it with oil. Later there was the addition of a head and phallus to the column, which became quadrangular (the number four was sacred to Hermes).


== Uses ==

In ancient Greece the statues were thought to ward off harm or evil, an apotropaic function, and were placed at crossings, country borders and boundaries as protection, in front of temples, near to tombs, outside houses, in the gymnasia, palaestrae, libraries, porticoes, and public places, at the corners of streets, on high roads as sign-posts, with distances inscribed upon them. Before his role as protector of merchants and travelers, Hermes was a phallic god, associated with fertility, luck, roads and borders. His name perhaps comes from the word herma, referring to a square or rectangular pillar of stone, terracotta, or bronze; a bust of Hermes' head, usually with a beard, sat on the top of the pillar, and male genitals adorned the base. The surmounting heads were not, however, confined to those of Hermes; those of other gods and heroes, and even of distinguished mortals, were of frequent occurrence. In this case a compound was formed: Hermathena (a herm of Athena), Hermares (of Ares), Hermherakles (of Herakles), Hermaphroditus (of Aphrodite—not to be confused with the son of Hermes and Aphrodite with the same name, Hermaphroditus, who had the genitals of both sexes), Hermanubis, Hermalcibiades, and so on. In Athens, where the hermai were most numerous and most venerated, they were placed outside houses as apotropes for good luck. They would be rubbed or anointed with olive oil and adorned with garlands or wreaths. This superstition persists, for example the Porcellino bronze boar of Florence (and numerous others like it around the world), where the nose is shiny from being continually touched for good luck or fertility.

In Roman and Renaissance versions (termini), the body was often shown from the waist up.  The form was also used for portrait busts of famous public figures, especially writers like Socrates and Plato. Anonymous female figures were often used from the Renaissance on, when herms were often attached to walls as decoration.


== Trial of Alcibiades ==
In 415 BC, on a night shortly before the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse as part of the Sicilian Expedition of the Peloponnesian War, all of the Athenian hermai were vandalized. Many people at the time thought such an impious act would threaten the success of the expedition.
Though it was never proven, the Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or Spartan sympathizers from Athens itself; one suspect was the writer Xenophon. Enemies of Alcibiades, using the anger of the Athenians as a pretext to investigate further desecrations, accused him of other acts of impiety, including mutilations of other sacred objects and mocking performances of religious mystery ceremonies. He denied the accusations and offered to stand trial, but the Athenians did not want to disrupt the expedition any further, and his opponents wanted to use his absence to incite the people against him at a time when he would not be able to defend himself.
Once he had left on the expedition, his political enemies had him charged and sentenced to death in absentia, both for the mutilation of the hermai, and the supposedly related crime of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries.


== Art and popular culture ==
In Plato's Hipparchus, Socrates attributes the existence of these statues to Hipparchus. They were meant to educate the people in the country, outside of Athens, and make them admire Hipparchus' wisdom over the wisdom of the Delphic inscriptions. Hence he ordered the carvings of the following two inscriptions: ""This is a memorial to Hipparchus: Walk thinking just thoughts"" and ""This is a memorial to Hipparchus: Don't deceive a friend"" (229a–b). Socrates is making fun of Hipparchus, and his interlocutor, by this account.
The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles has a large collection of Roman Herma boundary marker stones in its stored collection.
An Aesop's fable makes fun of a statue of Hermes. When a pious dog offers to ""anoint"" it, the god hastily assures his worshipper that this is not necessary.
In the fantasy novel Lud-in-the-mist by Hope Mirrlees the main character unearths an important object by digging beneath an object called both a ""berm"" and a ""herm"". It is described as ""the tree yet not a tree, the man yet not a man"".

Lightning,"For the NHL team, see Tampa Bay Lightning
For the World War II fighter, see P-38 Lightning

Lightning is a very powerful electrical discharge made during a thunderstorm. The electric current makes the air very hot.  The suddenly heated air expands very quickly, which causes thunder.  Sometimes lightning happens between clouds.  Sometimes (in the rain) lightning goes from cloud to ground. If it goes from cloud to ground, it can strike a person. Around 2000 people are struck by lightning each year. A few of them are not killed.
About 50 to 100 lightning bolts strike the Earth every second. Lightning has hit the Empire State Building as many as 500 times a year. A bolt of lightning can reach temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun.

When lightning strikes, the surface rubs electrons from the lightning, and a spark of electricity shoots from the lightning to the surface. In a thunderstorm, the lower cloud has as many as 100 million volts of electricity. This electricity is given out either within the cloud, to the ground, to another cloud, or into the air. Lightning has been known to travel from the ground upwards to the cloud. In 1993, scientists discovered lightning bolts that shot upward from the top of a cumulonimbus cloud.
People can make and study lightning with a Tesla coil or a Van de Graaff Generator.


== Franklin experiment ==
Benjamin Franklin experimented with electricity and was interested in lightning. He discovered many things about lightning. In 1772, he was the first to show that a thunderstorm lets out electricity. In his book he suggested an experiment to test it. Joseph Priestley said that Franklin flew a kite to prove the presence of electricity in the storm, using a dry silk string to protect himself from the electricity in the wet hemp kitestring.

Teak furniture,"Teak wood is used for making boats, furniture, and other things which require resistance to the elements. Teak is used for outdoor furniture  but is not recommended for full exposure to sunlight. Being more expensive than most other woods, teak furniture has become something of a status symbol. Not only is it common for a teak bench, chair, or table to last 70 years with the correct care plan, it is also common to pass down such furniture to future generations as an heirloom.


== Types of teak furniture ==
Teak is originally from the teak tree with the Latin name Tectona grandis. The teak tree is common in Southeast Asia. Teak is a hardwood that is particularly resistant to different types of climate, making it suitable for shipbuilding and for furniture.
Teak furniture can remain outdoors in any climate year round, and can be left unfinished or protected. Plantation teak wood can be considered eco-friendly due to its long life expectancies. To ensure the reduction of impact teak furniture has to the environment, many forestry companies produce sustainably managed plantation teak.


=== Tables and dining sets ===
In places and seasons where eating outdoors is common and pleasant, it is common to find wooden dining tables and chairs in gardens, backyards, deck areas, patios, pool yards and sun rooms. Teak is an excellent material for this application, because it will not be broken down in the sun like plastics, it is less prone to the elements like other woods, it is lighter and cooler than iron, and will not easily bend or break like tubular metals.


=== Benches ===
Benches are perhaps the most common use of teak other than marine applications. Teak benches are ideal for commercial use due to their strong nature and natural resistance to decay and termites, and are available in an endless variety of designs.


=== Chaise loungers ===
Teak is popular for chaise loungers and other recumbent seating because it is more durable and better crafted than most plastic loungers and will not get hot in the sun like metal loungers. Since these chairs are heavy, they often have 2 or more wheels for easy transport from place to place.


=== Adirondacks armchairs ===
Adirondack chairs (also known as Muskoka chairs) are comfortable with their high backs, their contoured seats and their wide arm-rests. The arm-rests provide ample room for food and beverages for comfortable meals while reclining with no table required, making them popular with outdoor cafés and bistros as they offer seating and a small place for food without the need for a table.


=== Umbrellas ===
Teak is a popular and traditional wood for the frames of large umbrellas such as shade umbrellas and market umbrellas. While teak provides the durability, weather resistance and lightness needed for such an application, metals like aluminum are more popular and generally a cheaper choice.


=== Deep seating ===
Complemented with weather resistant and outdoor cushions and similar to living room furniture, deep seating patio furniture is becoming more and more popular in places with warmer climates. With landscaping and outdoor décor being such a popular trend, furniture to sit in and enjoy the space has followed suit. The teak wood construction allows patio furniture sets to last years longer than other wood furniture.


== Teak oil ==
""Teak oil"" is the name used by manufactures of various oil-based wood treatments intended for use on teak and other hardwoods. Teak oil most often contains linseed oil, but does not contain oil from the teak tree.

Stellar flyby,"Stellar flyby refers to the close passage of two or more stars, which remain unbound after their passage


====== Close stellar flybys to the Sun ======
The Sun resides in a region of relatively low stellar density in the Milky Way. Thus, close stellar flybys are relatuvely rare. However, once in a while a star can come relatively close.  One example is  Scholz's star (WISE designation WISE 0720−0846 or fully WISE J072003.20−084651.2), which is a dim binary stellar system 22 light-years (6.8 parsecs) from the Sun in the constellation Monoceros near the galactic plane. The system passed through the Solar System's Oort cloud roughly 70,000 years ago.  Gliese 710 or HIP 89825,  an orange 0.6 M☉ star in the constellation Serpens Cauda, is projected to pass near the Sun in about 1.29 million years at a predicted minimum distance of 0.051 parsecs—0.1663 light-years (10,520 astronomical units) (about 1.60 trillion km) – about 1/25th of the current distance to Proxima Centauri. 


====== Close stellar flybys in different environments ======
Close flybys are usually relatively rare among field stars, but are more common in star clusters In these groups of stars the stellar density is much higher, so that close passages of between stars are more common. In particular in young star clusters, open clusters and globular clusters stellar flybys are thought to be common. In young clusters, such close stellar flybys might influence the frequency and size of  protoplanetary discs, and influence the planet formation process in these environments.

Live-action animation,"Live-action animation is a film genre that combines live-action filmmaking with animation.
Projects that are both live-action and computer-animated tend to have fictional characters or figures represented and characterized by cast members through motion capture and then animated and modeled by animators. Films that are live-action and traditionally animated use hand-drawn, computer-generated imagery (CGI), or stop-motion animation.


== History ==


=== Origins of combining live-action and animation ===
The origins of live-action animation date back to the early 20th century, with pioneers such as the Frenchman Georges Méliès. Méliès is often credited with creating the first examples of this genre through his innovative use of special effects, animation, and live-action footage. His 1902 film, ""A Trip to the Moon"", although not a live-action animated film by the modern definition, laid the groundwork for the integration of imaginative elements into live-action films.
The genre really began to develop with the advent of techniques such as Rotoscoping, developed by Max Fleischer in the 1910s. Rotoscoping allowed animators to trace moving images, frame by frame, to generate realistic animations which could be integrated with real action scenes.
During the silent film era in the 1920s and 1930s, the popular animated cartoons of Max Fleischer included a series in which his cartoon character, Koko the Clown, interacted with the live world; for example, having a boxing match with a live kitten. In a variation from this and inspired by Fleischer, Walt Disney's first directorial efforts, years before Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was born in 1927 and Mickey Mouse in 1928, were the live-action animated Alice Comedies cartoons, in which a young live-action girl named Alice interacted with animated cartoon characters.
Many previous films have combined live-action with stop-motion animation using back projection, such as Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen films in the United States, and Aleksandr Ptushko, Karel Zeman and, more recently, Jan Švankmajer in Eastern Europe. The first feature film combining these forms was The Lost World (1925). In the Soviet film The New Gulliver (1935), the only character who was not animated was Gulliver himself.
Warner Bros.' cartoon You Ought to Be in Pictures, directed by Friz Freleng, featured animated Warner Bros. characters interacting with live-action people, and the genre broke new ground for the first time and paved the way for future films that also used this technique.
In another cartoon, The animated sequence in the 1945 film Anchors Aweigh, in which Gene Kelly dances with an animated Jerry Mouse, is one of the most famous scenes in film history.

Throughout the decades, Disney experimented with mixed segments of live-action and animation in several notable films, which are primarily considered live-action. In the Latin American film pair Saludos Amigos (1943) and The Three Caballeros (1945), Donald Duck cavorts with several Latin-American dancers, plus Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen Miranda), who gives him a kiss. In Song of the South (1946) Uncle Remus sings ""Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah"" in an animated field, and tells the stories of Brer Rabbit through animated sequences. So Dear to My Heart (1949) improved upon this.
The 1964 film Mary Poppins gained significant notoriety for its blend of live action and animation, with an extensive sequence located ""inside"" a street painting, including Dick Van Dyke dancing with penguin waiters. In 1971 Bedknobs and Broomsticks transported Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson to an underwater nightclub for dancing, followed by Tomlinson competing with anthropomorphic animals in an aggressive soccer match.
Inspired by the Swedish film Dunderklumpen! (1974), Walt Disney produced Pete's Dragon in 1977 to experiment with similar techniques, placing the animated dragon, Elliot, in a live-action setting.
The genre broke new ground again with Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, with Disney and Amblin Entertainment producing advanced special effects and photo-realistic interactions among animated characters and live actors. Memorable moments include the entrance of Jessica Rabbit in the Ink & Paint Club and Bob Hoskins handcuffed to the animated title character.


== Techniques ==

With live-action and traditional animated films, two negatives were double-printed onto the same release print pre-digitally. Since then, more complex techniques have used optical printers or aerial image animation cameras, which enabled more accurate positioning, and more realism for the interaction of actors and fictional animated characters. Often, every frame of the live-action film was traced by rotoscoping, so that the animator could add his drawing in the exact position. With the rise of computer animation, combining live action and animation became common.


== Exceptions ==
Since the late 1990s, some films have included large amounts of photorealistic computer animation alongside live-action filmmaking, such as the Star Wars prequels, The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Avatar franchise. These films are generally not considered animated due to the realism of the animation and the use of motion-capture performances, which are extensively based on live-action performances by implementing actors' movements and facial expressions into their characters. Roger Ebert said that ""in my mind, it isn't animation, unless it looks like animation.""

Wenge,"Millettia laurentii is a legume tree from Africa and is native to the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The species is listed as ""endangered"" in the IUCN Red List, principally due to the destruction of its habitat and over-exploitation for timber. Wenge, a dark coloured wood, is the product of Millettia laurentii. Other names sometimes used for wenge include faux ebony, dikela, mibotu, bokonge, and awong. The wood's distinctive colour is standardised as a ""wenge"" colour in many systems.


== Wood ==
Wenge ( WENG-gay) is a tropical timber, very dark in colour with a distinctive figure and pattern. The wood is heavy and hard, suitable for flooring and staircases.
Several musical instrument makers employ wenge in their products. Mosrite used it for bodies of their Brass Rail models. Ibanez and Cort use it for the five-piece necks of some of their electric basses. Warwick electric basses use FSC sourced wenge for fingerboards and necks as of 2013. It is also used by Yamaha as the centre ply of their Absolute Hybrid Maple drums.
The wood is popular in segmented woodturning because of its dimensional stability and colour contrast when mixed with lighter woods such as maple. This makes it especially sought after in the manufacture of high-end wood canes and chess boards.
The wood is sometimes used in the making of archery bows, particularly as a laminate in the production of flatbows. It can also be used in the making of rails or pin blocks on hammered dulcimers.
The wood may also be used for kendamas. Though a ken could be made entirely out of wenge, it's generally used to substitute a portion of the big/small cups while the rest of the ken is made out of a softer, less dense wood. This concentration of weight in the big and/or small cup facilitates balance tricks such as lunars.


== Health hazards ==
The dust produced when cutting or sanding wenge can cause dermatitis similar to the effects of poison ivy  and is an irritant to the eyes. The dust also can cause respiratory problems and drowsiness. Splinters are septic, similar to those of greenheart (the wood of Chlorocardium rodiei).

Software visualization,"Software visualization or software visualisation refers to the visualization of information of and related to software systems—either the architecture of its source code or metrics of their runtime behavior—and their development process by means of static, interactive or animated 2-D or 3-D visual representations of their structure, execution, behavior, and evolution.


== Software system information ==
Software visualization uses a variety of information available about software systems. Key information categories include: 

implementation artifacts such as source codes,
software metric data from measurements or from reverse engineering,
traces that record execution behavior,
software testing data (e.g., test coverage)
software repository data that tracks changes.


== Objectives ==
The objectives of software visualization are to support the understanding of software systems (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis and exploration of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high coupling) and their development and evolution. One of the strengths of software visualization is to combine and relate information of software systems that are not inherently linked, for example by projecting code changes onto software execution traces.
Software visualization can be used as tool and technique to explore and analyze software system information, e.g., to discover anomalies similar to the process of visual data mining. For example, software visualization is used to monitoring activities such as for code quality or team activity. Visualization is not inherently a method for software quality assurance. Software visualization participates to Software Intelligence in allowing to discover and take advantage of mastering inner components of software systems.


== Types ==
Tools for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and quality defects during software development and maintenance activities. There are different approaches to map source code to a visual representation such as by software maps Their objective includes, for example, the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Commonly, they visualize the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.
More or less specialized graph drawing software is used for software visualization. A small-scale 2003 survey of researchers active in the reverse engineering and software maintenance fields found that a wide variety of visualization tools were used, including general purpose graph drawing packages like GraphViz and GraphEd, UML tools like Rational Rose and Borland Together, and more specialized tools like Visualization of Compiler Graphs (VCG) and Rigi.: 99–100  The range of UML tools that can act as a visualizer by reverse engineering source is by no means short; a 2007 book noted that besides the two aforementioned tools, ESS-Model, BlueJ, and Fujaba also have this capability, and that Fujaba can also identify design patterns.

Diabetes self-management,"Diabetes self-management refers to the ongoing process in which individuals with diabetes actively participate in managing their condition through lifestyle choices, medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and education, aimed at maintaining optimal blood sugar levels and preventing complications.
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting over 537 million adults worldwide in 2021 and predicted to reach 643 million people by 2030. It is a global health burden and improving the health outcomes for people with diabetes is critical to reducing the economic and human burden of diabetes. Self-management is the cornerstone for successful health outcomes in diabetes patients as there is a positive association between self-management behaviour and care outcomes. Self-management stresses the importance of the role of an individual and their responsibility in developing skilled behaviours to manage one's own illness. 


== Self-management activities ==
Healthcare organisations are increasingly focusing on providing diabetes self-management education and support programs to enable diabetes patients to effective self-management. Diabetes patients face daily challenges due to the impact of their decisions on their health outcomes. Diabetes self-management helps diabetes patients to make better decisions and change their behaviour to achieve better outcomes. Diabetes self-management activities mainly consist of seven self-care behaviours. They are healthy eating, monitoring indicators of diabetes, physical activity, taking medication, healthy coping, and problem-solving.


=== Foot care ===
Diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease are at risk of developing foot ulcers and infection. Poor knowledge about self-care increases the risk of amputation.  Adoption of suitable preventative measures and early treatment of diabetic foot problems are important components of diabetes foot care.  Good knowledge and practice regarding diabetes foot care can reduce the risk of foot complications and amputation. Regular examination of the foot is one of the fundamental steps to modifying the foot risk factors thereby reducing the risk of ulceration and amputation. Footwear tailored to the specific pathology of the patient can enable conservative management of the foot including debridement of the callus. Appropriate footwear can reduce abnormal pressure, reduce the rate of formation callus and ulcers and protect the foot from external trauma.


=== Blood glucose monitoring ===
Regular monitoring of blood glucose and optimal glucose control is a major part of diabetes self-management. Diabetes patients need to be capable of testing blood sugar at home at the recommended frequency. Frequent self- monitoring of blood glucose and record keeping is key to identifying the possibility of hypoglycemia. Diabetes patients should be able to know how to respond when blood sugar levels are too high or too low.


=== Medication ===
Effective medication is the cornerstone of the proper treatment of diseases. Many patients fail to take the medication as prescribed and many patients prematurely discontinue their medication. Poor medication adherence in patients with diabetes is a costly public health challenge in many healthcare systems. Non-adherence to medication leads to poor treatment outcomes and the progression of diseases and complications. The medication adherence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients assessed using self-report, pill counts, electronic monitoring devices and medication possession ratio found that the medication adherence rates ranged from 31% to 87%. The medication adherence of diabetes patients is also measured by persistence which is defined by the proportion of patients who remained in treatment for a predetermined period and the mean number of days till discontinuation of treatment. The persistence rates ranged from 16% to 63% at 12 months and ranged from 29% to 70%.       


=== Physical activity ===
Physical activity has a favourable influence on the health and well-being of diabetes patients as it achieves physiological changes, including improved overall glycemic control, liver insulin sensitivity, muscle glucose uptake and utilisation and overcomes the metabolic abnormalities related to type 2 diabetes. Diabetes patients can undertake light to moderate physical activity. The type of physical activity that can be performed by diabetes patients needs to be determined after consultations with health care providers. The physical activities recommended for diabetes patients include brisk walking, recreational games and leisure time activities. The most benefit of physical activity happens in the early progression of the disease.


=== Healthy eating habits ===
A healthy diet is one component of the management of diabetes. Dietary self-care behaviours include eating a low-saturated-fat diet making choices based on the glycemic index of food and controlling the amount of carbohydrates in food. Sticking to the eating plan and following the diet plan when eating from a restaurant or when feeling stressed is a major challenge for diabetes patients.


== Recommended practices and specific behaviors ==
Understanding the levels (recommended practices) and patterns (specific behaviors) of primary daily diabetes self-management from a heterogeneous sample population is essential to devise suitable interventions to enhance the daily diabetes management of diabetes patients. Many of the diabetes self-management data involve only a small and highly selected sample, which does not represent the minorities and disadvantaged communities. The study conducted on a heterogeneous sample of population including minorities found that self-management levels increase with age. The same study found that  retired individuals and homemakers have better self-management than employed individuals.    


== Barriers to effective self-management ==
Diabetes patients need to actively self-manage their diseases in everyday life for good diabetes outcomes. However, there are certain barriers to the effective day-to-day management of the disease. This section identified the main barriers to the effective self-management of diabetes.   


=== Financial constraints ===
Financial constraints or poverty is a barrier to effective self-management as it prevents access to food, healthcare, medication and information. The most significant impact of lack of financial resources is on the food consumption pattern, resulting in a vicious cycle of high carbohydrate consumption and hyperglycaemia. Diabetes patients with limited financial resources often report that they find it difficult to purchase adequate food and it becomes impossible to buy different food for the family. Financial difficulties cause diabetes care to become a problem of least importance as they have more pressing needs such as feeding the family and repaying loans. When it comes to buying medicines for diabetes management, people from poor financial backgrounds choose food over medicine. To save costs, people from poor economic backgrounds alter the prescribed dosage of medication and medication is often taken with diabetes complications or the development of co-morbid illness.      


=== Norms and belief system ===
The attitude towards self-care behaviour is influenced by the local belief systems and social norms.  Patients who attribute diabetes control to god are less likely to self-manage and control their sugar intake. A study found that subjective norms attributed to 49%  of the variance in the intent to perform diabetes-related self-management.
An individual's and their family's beliefs about diabetes influence how they make sense of their disease and make efforts to manage their illness. For example, individuals who are not adhering to the dietary intake shared the view that their decision to not follow the required dietary pattern is because they believe that their family, friends and peers would not approve of their diet. Inadequate family support and cultural beliefs prevent diabetes patients from adhering to a diet with low-saturated fatty acids. In Subsaharan Africa, diabetes patients face social stigma from family and community members from diabetes and diabetes-related self-management requirements which prevent diabetes-related self-care. A study found that when there is diabetes that runs in the family, it becomes a family affair and participants normalise and downplay the seriousness of the disease. 
Gender-based family roles prevent adhering to the medication. In a study, woman responsible for house duties were found to have inadequate time to visit health facilities resulting in their ignoring their health care needs such as diabetes management.    


=== Low knowledge ===
Diabetes knowledge has a significant influence on the self-care and glycemic control of a diabetes patient. The lower knowledge about diabetes can affect diabetes management. Studies have found that patient's lack of knowledge and poor self-care practice is increasing the severity of diabetes every year.   The level of education is a factor that has a positive correlation with self-care knowledge.


=== Stigma ===
Family support is highly beneficial for effective self-care. Diabetes-related stigma leads to a lack of family support and poor diabetes-related self-management behaviours.


=== Inadequate support ===
Diabetes patients expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of healthcare professionals as they directly wrote prescription and directions without a proper conversation with the patients. This prevents patients from asking lingering questions about their health conditions and management. 
Inadequate coordination between the health care providers and diabetes patients is a major barrier to properly implementing the care guidelines. Lack of collaboration and coordination leads to information conflict affecting the quality of self-management.  The diabetes patients who were identified to develop healthy diabetes management habits had a supportive patient-provider relationship. People from economically disadvantaged backgrounds can have limited access to care which is one reason for inadequate coordination between healthcare providers and patients.


== Role of healthcare professionals ==
Healthcare professionals play a crucial role in diabetes self-management. Diabetes patients rely on health care professionals to obtain information and support in developing an individualised self-management plan.  Self-management goals and recommendations given by health care professionals were identified to have a significant positive impact on the eating habits and physical activity of diabetes patients. Lack of proper emphasis on self-management may suggest to diabetes patients that self-management is either less important or even unimportant for diabetes management.

Visibility,"Visibility is a word used in meteorology. It is used to talk about how far a normal person can see depending on the weather. If there is low visibility, such as in a blizzard, a person will not be able to see far. If there is high visibility, such as on a bright, sunny day, a person will be able to see a long way.
Visibility less than 100 metres (330 ft) is often called zero. When it is this low, roads may be closed, or lights and signs are turned on to warn drivers. These are put in areas that often have very low visibility. Warning lights help stop accidents. Automobile crashes with many cars happen often in places like this if the warning lights and signs are not put up.
Visibility is said to be good when a person can see farther than about 10 kilometers.
An advisory is put out by meteorologists to warn of low visibility, such as a dense fog advisory from the U.S. National Weather Service. These tell drivers to not travel until the fog leaves. Airport travel sometimes is delayed, or slowed down, by low visibility.

DigiCel FlipBook,"DigiCel FlipBook is 2D animation software that runs on Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X. It is intended to closely recreate the traditional animation process, very similar to the likes of TVPaint and Toon Boom Harmony.


== Features ==
FlipBook supports scanning physical drawings with a TWAIN-compliant scanner or webcam, or direct input via a Wacom tablet. In either case, the internal format is raster-based, not vector-based. Each frame must be drawn separately; FlipBook intentionally does not support skeletal animation or morph target animation, as these are not part of the traditional animator's toolkit.


== Versions ==
FlipBook is available in four versions: Lite, Studio, Pro and Pro HD. The Lite edition supports one foreground and one background layer, one soundtrack, and up to three hundred frames per shot. The other editions support more layers, more frames, multiple soundtracks and higher output resolutions.
A free, full-featured demo version which produces watermarked output is also available for download.

== Department of Electrical Engineering ==
The Stanford Department of Electrical Engineering, also known as EE; Double E, is a department at Stanford University. Established in 1894, it is one of nine engineering departments that comprise the school of engineering, and in 1971, had the largest graduate enrollment of any department at Stanford University. The department is currently located in the David Packard Building on Jane Stanford Way in Stanford, California.


=== History ===


==== Early developments (1800s–1940s) ====
Stanford University opened in 1891, and within the year, courses addressing topics such as electrical currents and magnetism were being taught by professors such as A.P. Carman. Professor Frederic A.C. Perrine was the first faculty to teach the subject of electrical engineering at Stanford, in 1893. In 1983, when F.A.C. Perrine was appointed Stanford's first professor of electrical engineering, the program focused on central generating plants for electricity. Frederic A.C. Perrine, in 1893, made an acknowledgement of gifts to Stanford's Electrical Engineering Department in The Stanford Daily, among them 30 horse power double reduction street-railroad motor, field magnets, and various machines from the General Electric Company and wires from American Electrical Works and New England Butt Company.
Prior to 1894, electrical engineering had been taught as part of the Physics and Mechanical Engineering curriculum. That year, the EE Department was established in the Engineering Labs. In 1894, the first undergraduate degree in electrical engineering was awarded to Lucien Howard Gilmore of Capron, Illinois.
In January 1894, the electrical engineering department proposed building an electrical railroad from the university to Palo Alto. Perrine gave the project to students, with the land having been purchased by private owners prior for a railroad that had fallen through. The design proposed no overhead wires, with the plant to be owned by Stanford University, and the engineering and management to be entirely constructed by the different engineering departments at Stanford. A telegraph office was set up in the Electrical Engineering building in 1897 to act as an operator for the Western Union Company.
In 1898, it was reported that Perrine was taking a two-year leave of absence from teaching, but would continue to reside in Palo Alto and would still have charge of the electrical engineering department. With the advancement of electricity, industry and employment opportunities proved plentiful for those with knowledge in the subject. In 1899, Standard Electrical Company completed one of the world's longest transmission lines. Professor FAC Perrine was the engineer, and the following year, he left academia for industry. When Perrine left in 1898, the department was administered instead by civil or mechanical engineering professors instead until 1905. That year, Harris J. Ryan was named both professor and chair of electrical engineering. Under Ryan, the department began teaching high voltage transmission of electric power.
A branch association formed at Stanford University of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1904, with membership limited to upper classmen in the Stanford Electrical Engineering Department. In 1919, Leonard F. Fuller earned a PhD degree at Stanford's electrical engineering department. Primary faculty of the EE department as of 1923 included Ryan as professor, J.C. Clark as associate professor, H.H. Henline as assistant professor, and two instructors. Henline started the communications laboratory in 1924.
In 1925, Stanford established the school of engineering, with all undergraduate degrees in engineering given out by the school instead of the departments with the new change. F.E. Terman joined EE as an instructor, introducing radio courses, and also in 1925, the department opened The Ryan High Voltage Laboratory, financed in large part by Los Angeles and the private power industry.
Leonard Fuller returned to Stanford to serve as an acting professor of electrical engineering from 1946 until he retired in 1954.


==== Government contracts (1940s–1960s) ====
According to historian Piero Scaruffi, in 1946, Frederick E. Terman became dean of Stanford's engineering school, using his connections with the military and the Office of Naval Research to both start and fund the Electronics Research Lab (ERL). The Korean War in 1950 brought in a new infusion of funds from the Office of Naval Research, and Terman used the money to open the Applied Electronics Library, then opening the adjacent Stanford Industrial Park nearby for private business. Terman served as head of the electrical engineering department and dean of the school of engineering until he retired in 1965.
In 1947, E. Ginzton in the EE department helped design and build the first Linear Accelerator. Also that year, a Joint Services Electronics Contract was signed, with the department stating on its website that the contract started ""large scale Federal support of Department Research.""
The department's Microwave Laboratory in 1949 was moved into a new building with Edward Ginzton as director, and was later turned into the Ginzton Laboratory. The department opened its Electronics Research Library (ERL) in 1951, with HP and Gilfillan ""significantly"" supporting construction until 1956, according to the department. An IBM 650 computer was maintained in ERL, which was the only air-conditioned room in the building. In 1955, the department held its first courses in digital and analog computing. In 1955, Stanford merged the Electronics Research Laboratory and the Applied Electronics Laboratory into the Systems Engineering Laboratory, to focus on electronic warfare under Terman. According to Stanford, the Applied Electronics Laboratory (AEL) was constructed in 1958 to ""support military classified research in electronic countermeasures.""


==== Gibbons Plan and AEL occupations (1960s–1970s) ====
John G. Linvill was appointed EE chair in 1964 and subsequently built the semiconductor program at Stanford.
In May 1966, after comments by Stanford administration about contracts, there was picketing by students at Stanford University protesting the Electrical Engineering Department's contract with the Central Intelligence Agency. Heffner kept the nature what he called ""purely an engineering research project"" secret, stating ""we accept grants from donors with whom we do not particularly care to be allied, but we will not refuse a gift if its objectives are worthwhile.""
In January 1969, chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department John Linvill stated that the department would allow the enrollment of ""minority group"" students to study for advanced degrees in electrical engineering. In the Gibbons Plan, the students were only allowed partial credits, with their studies financed by their external employers.
On April 3, 1969, 700 students voted to occupy the AEL. This formed the April Third Movement, a coalition of Stanford campus organizations, occupied the Applied Electronics Laboratory for nine days, in protest for Stanford doing classified work for the government. 1400 Stanford community members signed a statement of participation. At the time, the lab was linked with classified military electronics research and electronic warfare being used against the Vietnamese people. The students of the April Third Movement occupied the hallways of the Applied Electronics Lab building, shutting down research for the occupation. Students slept on the roof of the lab, with large nightly meetings. The group also used the publishing materials in the basement to product documents linking Stanford trustees to defense contractors. The sit-in ultimately led to the school severing ties with the former Stanford Research Institute and moving its military research off campus.
In later 1969, the Applied Electronics Laboratory (AEL), was a part of the Stanford Electronic Laboratory, which was the ""research affiliate of the electrical engineering department, especially in doctoral research."" That year, AEL director William Rambo admitted after criticism and a sit-in protest that the laboratory was working with the Department of Defense in matters related to the Vietnam War.
In 1969, Stanford EE classes were broadcast to Silicon Valley by the Stanford Instructional Television Network for the first time.
In 1971, the electrical engineering department had the largest graduate enrollment of any department at Stanford University.


=== Recent chairs and research (1980s–2020s) ===
In 1981, R.L.White was appointed EE chair, with a number of successions over the next two decades.
In 1997, James Plummer became the department chair, as the John M. Fluke Professor of Electrical Engineering. He became dean of the overall engineering department in 1999. Mark Horowitz was appointed chair of EE in 2009.
Jelena Vučković was the ""Fortinet Founders"" chair of the department as of 2023, leading the department's Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics (NQP) lab. The department is currently based out of the David Packard Building on Jane Stanford Way in Stanford, California. Research is also done out of other locations at Stanford University.


=== Degrees ===
The Stanford University Department of Electrical Engineering offers Bachelor of Science degrees with a major in electrical engineering, full-time Master of Science degrees, and doctoral of philosophy (EE PhD) degrees.

Heritage commodification,"Heritage commodification is the process by which cultural themes and expressions come to be evaluated primarily in terms of their exchange value, specifically within the context of cultural tourism. These cultural expressions and aspects of heritage become ""cultural goods,"" transformed into commodities to be bought, sold and profited from in the heritage tourism industry. In the context of modern globalization, complex and often contradictory layers of meaning are produced in local societies, and the marketing of one's cultural expressions can degrade a particular culture while simultaneously assisting in its integration into the global economy. The repatriation of profits, or ""leakage"", that occurs with the influx of tourist capital into a heritage tourist site (including handicraft vendors, food vendors, basket makers, and several other items that are produced locally and rely upon tourist capital) is a crucial part of any sustainable development that can be considered beneficial to local communities. Modern heritage tourism reproduces an economic dynamic that is dependent upon capital from tourists and corporations in creating sustained viability. Tourism is often directly tied to economic development, so many populations see globalization as providing increased access to vital medical services and important commodities.  

The tourism industry has been rapidly growing during the past two decades, and the expansion will probably continue well into the future.  There were nearly one billion tourist arrivals in 2008(to where?), compared to only twenty-five million in 1950. Moreover, in 2008, tourism directly accounted for nearly one trillion US dollars. Worldwide, approximately five percent of GDP is generated by tourism, and a similar proportion of people are employed in the tourism industry. As each individual culture positioned for tourism needs a particular ""selling point"" in order to attract tourist capital, certain aspects of their heritage are allowed to be appropriated in order to give the tourist the impression that he or she is receiving an ""authentic"" experience. In this way, tourism also provides opportunities for communities to define who they are and bolster their identities through the commodification of certain cultural aspects that the community deems important and worthy of reproduction. Tourist destinations must have a specific set of characteristics that set themselves apart from every other destination, and this is where local communities choose how they will represent themselves to the world. This power to create an identity and reproduce the mechanisms of a group's identity in the realm of cultural tourism allows local populations to express their ethnic pride and ""imbue places and events with identities that best represent their particular interests and values"".


== Authenticity and the tourist gaze ==

The ""tourist gaze"" is explained by sociologist John Urry as the set of expectations that tourists place on local populations when they participate in heritage tourism, in the search for having an ""authentic"" experience. In response to tourist expectations and often cultural and racial stereotypes, local populations reflect back the ""gaze"" of the expectations of tourists in order to benefit financially. Tourists cannot bear all of the blame for this process, however, as the aggressively promoted marketing efforts of tour operators, popular media, and local governments all contribute to the production of the tourist ""gaze"". This gaze is often described as a destructive process, in which often important local cultural expressions are reduced to commodities, and these traditions fall out of favor with local populations. They can also be destructive in that local populations become consumed by an economic process which values certain cultural expressions over others, and cultural themes that cannot be easily commodified fall out of favor and can be eventually lost. This gaze can also serve as a booster of ethnic identity, as it can revive cultural traditions that may have fallen out of favor under the vestiges of colonialism and imperialism. Because of the importance of tourist capital in many local societies, indigenous peoples are placed in a dynamic where cultural ""authenticity"" becomes something very tangible and necessary to achieve economic success. This ""reconstruction of ethnicity"" becomes important, because locals tend to act out cultural patterns and behaviors that they believe would satisfy tourists most. The local populations play on stereotypes that Westerners have on their cultures, and seek to perform them as best they can to satisfy the consumer demand. The power that the ""tourist gaze"" has in supporting ethnic pride and identity can also be used to destroy ethnic pride and identity, in the cases where tourist expectations do not align with the everyday reality of local populations. In the village of San Jose Succotz in Belize, local Mayan populations had given up many of their traditional practices and traditions. However, because of their close proximity to ancient Maya ruins and the resultant tourist interest in their areas, the villagers began to go back into the past and recreate traditional Maya cultural patterns and traditions. In recreating these images, their identities were changed completely and they were placed back within an ""ethnographic present"" of classical Maya indigenous cultural expressions and land use patterns. Unfortunately, this 'act' also gives more savvy tourists the impression that the Maya are extinct, and their traditions are only being reenacted by local populations, obscuring the reality that there are over a million Maya alive today.


== Contested authenticity ==
One anthropologist has studied how in one Maya village of Yucatán, Mexico, involvement in tourism is seen as dangerous and urban Maya are seen as outsiders to the traditional Maya society. Maya villages that supply much of the migrant labor that goes to Cancun and other tourist destinations also reflect on what it means to be Maya, and migrants who go to Cancun are seen as ""less Maya"" than those who stay behind. The migrant workers follow the promise of jobs and socioeconomic advancement to the tourist destinations of Cancun, and in the process they are considered to be ""de-Mayanized"" by traditional Maya. Traditional Maya ""de-ethnicize"" urban Maya people as a strategy to keep their traditional ways of life intact. This one anthropologist believes that the traditional Maya fear the urbanization of Maya people because of the cultural commodification that often accompanies the tourism industry. This potential commodification is seen as detrimental to traditional Maya ways of life, mostly by anthropologists who carry a negative ideological perspective on tourism. This idea however cannot be generalized to other Maya communities in Yucatán or even to other indigenous communities in Mexico or anywhere else in Latin America.     In contrast, there are examples throughout Yucatán and Quintana Roo where Maya people are heavily involved in tourism service sector in positive and willing ways.  In contrast to the one community mentioned above, Maya communities such as Tulum, Rio Lagartos, Holbox, Isla Mujeres, Dzitnup, Ebtun, Piste, Santa Elena, and Xcalacoop, to mention a few have local economies fully integrated into the tourism network and also maintain traditional culture. Because tourism is an economic service industry that is created out of capitalism there is therefore always unequal benefits; this happens regardless of the racial or cultural identities of those who benefit and those who do not benefits as much.  
While the Maya people are not required to engage in the tourism industry, tourism often incorporates entire Maya towns and marketplaces. Although most of the people involved in the informal sector are aware of their subordinate economic roles in a larger global system, handicraft vendors continue to 'perform' for Western tourists in order to make their cultural commodities and 'goods' appear to be more 'authentic' and receive tourist capital. This disjunction between public performance and daily life is a perpetual reality for many Maya people living and working in Central America.
Heritage tourism excursions tend to be associated with one ethnic group in a given locality. In this context, topic and place becomes the defining characteristic of a people to the exclusion of other perspectives. This creates a dynamic where tourists use the ""questioning gaze"", in which travelers' questions and skepticism penetrate the commercial presentation of the site, and undermine the producer's dominant narrative. If a tourist feels that a heritage site is producing a dubious interpretation of a cultural expression or experience, the site loses its ""authenticity"" and it becomes less marketable, and harder to commodify. Three sites in Kenya trace the commodification of particular aspects of the Maasai tribal culture, and how these sites are marketed with varying degrees of commodification and authenticity in order to satisfy tourist expectations.


=== Mayers Ranch ===
This site, built by a British family in the Great Rift Valley 30 miles away from Nairobi, commodified Maasai cultural expressions through historic reenactments of Maasai warriors in traditional song and dance, at a comfortably safe distance away from tourists. In these performances, Maasai culture is presented as ahistorical and static. There was a painstaking strive for satisfying the tourist ""gaze"" and provide a sense of authenticity, most notably through contrasts between civilized European and primitive African. This site was eventually closed by the Kenyan government because of the colonial nature of the presentation of Maasai culture was offensive to many Kenyans (because whites were producing images of blacks) and African-Americans.


=== Bomas Village of Kenya ===

This historic site caters mostly by urban Kenyans, so the commodification of these particular themes are especially problematic, as in this case, most of the tourists are actually stakeholders in the historic representation being marketed at this site. To give a critical sense of authenticity, national folklore troupes were formed to tell stories that purposely promote Kenyan nationalism/equality among ethnic groups. There are performances in a modern stadium arena, which creates a juxtaposition of modern and traditional that reflects greater Kenyan society. The representation of several Kenyan ethnic groups and culturally relevant narratives express a politically charged message – Kenyan nationalism. When the tourists that visit the site are the actual stakeholders in the process, culture cannot simply be commodified as a good. The commodification of the Maasai culture is locally managed and produced in this circumstance.


=== Kichwa Tembo (Out of Africa Sundowner) ===
This is an upscale tourist site that caters mostly to wealthy Western tourists. At this historic site, Maasai performers mix with tourists during performance, involving them into many aspects of the performance. Pop culture images of Africa dominate performance, reckoning back to classic movies such as Out of Africa. All of the comforts of home are present in the luxury lodges, and the site is mostly catered towards the entertainment of tourists, not necessarily 'authenticity'. In this instance, the tourist gaze is used as a pretext for the greater luxury experience of an upscale, African safari. All of the historical tensions and contrasts are dissolved, and performances include a mash-up of Hakuna matata, Kum Bah Ya, and Jamaican reggae. These elements all meld together nonsensically into a locally placed African context. The Maasai culture is commodified into a representation of a popular American image of what African cultures are – not authentic African performances. These performances provide the greater accessibility of safe, pleasant primitives. The Maasai are stakeholders in process, but have relatively minor control over their representation, as tour agency production forces are hidden but dominate the interpretive process. Many of the Maasai people are forced into a willingness to play into the commodified stereotypes of their culture for economic benefit.


== Place as a commodity: eco-tourism ==
The specific natural attributes of a place also can become commodities, as the environment of a locale can become a ""good"", just as important as the cultural heritage in attracting tourist capital. A population's heritage is indubitably tied to their local environment. However, in the case of eco-tourism, education about sustainability and preservation are common themes that emerge in the rhetoric of the industry. An alternative form of tourism, ecotourism is defined as ""a form of tourism inspired primarily by the natural history of an area, including its indigenous cultures"". Ecotourism has a generally low impact on local environments, and it allows tourists to gain an appreciation for the natural resources and attributes of the tourist destination. These tourist programs provide capital that can be used to improve the economic situations of local environments, as well as help fund conservation efforts to offset years of environmental degradation caused by tourist activity. Because of the conservational goals of ecotourism, local communities have the opportunity to engage more with governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and private tourist firms in the design and production of tourist destinations. Ecotourism can offer local populations political and economic agency over the products of their labor, and levy a degree of control over their economic development.

Impossible object,"An impossible object is a kind of optical illusion. Impossible objects are also known as undecidable figures. In this kind of illusion, a person looks at a two-dimensional picture. The vision center of the brain does much of its work subconsciously  and automatically. It interprets the figure as a three-dimensional object.
The viewer usually knows such an object is impossible soon after looking at the figure. However, the impression of a 3D figure may still remain even when the viewer knows it is impossible in reality.
Some of these figures are more subtle. In these cases it is not obvious that they are impossible right away. The viewer carefully needs to look at the geometry of the object to find out that it is indeed impossible.
Impossible objects are of interest to psychologists, mathematicians and artists.


== History ==
Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd was the first person to draw many impossible objects. He has been called ""the father of impossible figures"". In 1934, he drew the Penrose triangle, some years before the Penroses. The way Reutersvärd drew it, the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes.
In 1956, British psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, mathematician Roger Penrose, submitted a short article to the British Journal of Psychology titled Impossible objects: a special type of visual illusion. This was illustrated with the Penrose Triangle and Penrose stairs. The article referenced Escher, whose work had sparked their interest in the subject, but not Reutersvärd, whom they were unaware of. The article was only published in 1958.
From the 1930s onwards Dutch artist M.C. Escher produced many drawings with paradoxes of perspective. In 1957 he produced his first drawing containing a true impossible object: Cube with Magic Ribbons. He produced many other drawings of impossible objects, sometimes with the entire drawing being an undecidable figure. His work did much to draw the attention of the public to impossible objects. Some artists of the time are also experimenting with impossible figures, for example, Jos de Mey, Shigeo Fukuda, Sandro del Prete, István Orosz (Utisz), Guido Moretti, Tamás F. Farkas and Mathieu Hamaekers.


== In fiction ==
In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ""I, Borg"", a plan was made to destroy the entire race of Borg—malevolent cybernetic aliens whose minds were interconnected—by showing one of the Borg a picture of a highly complex impossible object. This image would be transmitted back to the Borg hive, overloading its consciousness in larger and larger attempts to understand the image. This plan was dismissed as being genocide, so its potential results were never seen.
In the computer game Diablo II, the ""Arcane Sanctuary"" region was based on impossible drawings.
Alan Moore's miniseries 1963 features a character called the Hypernaut that lives in a space station shaped like an impossible object.
In the video game Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem the Essence of Xel'lotath, the Sigil of Xel'lotath, is an impossible artifact resembling a warped angel.
In The Simpsons episode ""Treehouse of Horror VIII"", a blivet (or devil's tuning fork) can be seen on Professor Frink's yard sale. In The Simpsons Movie, Homer falls down miles of the impossible infinite House of Stairs while having an epiphany.
The video game Echochrome for the PSP and PS3 features a mannequin who must traverse a series of impossible objects.
The set of the climactic scene in the Goblin King's castle in the 1986 fantasy film, Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson, is based on M. C. Escher's ""Relativity"", and features impossible staircases and perspectives.
In Pokemon Platinum there is an area full of impossibilities such as these.

Regression theorem,"The Regression Theorem, first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in his 1912 book The Theory of Money and Credit, states that the value of money can be traced back (""regressed"") to its value as a commodity. The theorem claims that at a point in time there was a good with intersubjective exchange value based on the value of it as a commodity (i.e. silver, gold, etc.), which led to the good's capacity in given circumstances to procure a specific quantity of other goods as an equivalent in exchange and is derived from the human process of valuing individual goods not granted from nature, based on emotion which was then gradually adopted as money.
Recently, there has been a debate about applying Regression Theorem to Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin (for instance) is not backed by any commodity, it appears to fail the definition of a currency according to the Regression Theorem. Others hold the view that Bitcoin does fit the definition as it is at once a payment system and money, with the source of value being the payment system.

Cancer exodus hypothesis,"The cancer exodus hypothesis establishes that circulating tumor cell clusters (CTC clusters) maintain their multicellular structure throughout the metastatic process. It was previously thought that these clusters must dissociate into single cells during metastasis. According to the hypothesis, CTC clusters intravasate (enter the bloodstream), travel through circulation as a cohesive unit, and extravasate (exit the bloodstream) at distant sites without disaggregating, significantly enhancing their metastatic potential. This concept is considered a key advancement in understanding of cancer biology and CTCs role in cancer metastasis.


== Mechanism ==
Traditionally, it was believed that CTC clusters needed to dissociate into individual cells during their journey through the bloodstream to seed secondary tumors. However, recent studies show that CTC clusters can travel through the bloodstream intact, enabling them to perform every step of metastasis while maintaining their group/cluster structure. 
The cancer exodus hypothesis asserts that CTC clusters have several distinct advantages that increase their metastatic potential:

Higher metastatic efficiency: CTC clusters have been shown to possess superior seeding capabilities at distant sites compared to single CTCs.
Survival and proliferation: The collective nature of CTC clusters allows them to share resources and offer intercellular support, improving their overall survival rates in the bloodstream.
Resistance to treatment: CTC clusters exhibit unique gene expression profiles that contribute to their ability to evade certain cancer therapies, making them more resistant than individual tumor cells.


== Clinical relevance ==
The cancer exodus hypothesis offers important insights into how metastasis occurs and highlights the significance of CTC clusters in cancer progression. Detecting and analyzing CTC clusters through liquid biopsies could offer valuable information about the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of cancers. This information is particularly useful for identifying patients who may benefit from more aggressive treatment strategies.


== Characterization ==
The hypothesis was developed due to several key studies, which have demonstrated the ability of CTC clusters to:

Intravasate and travel as clusters: Research has shown that CTC clusters can enter the bloodstream as a group, travel through the circulatory system intact, and maintain their cluster phenotype during transit.
Extravasate through angiopellosis: A key finding of the hypothesis is that CTC clusters do not need to disaggregate to exit the bloodstream. Instead, they can undergo a process called angiopellosis, in which entire clusters migrate out of the blood vessels as a group, retaining their multicellular form. 
These findings underscore the critical role of CTC clusters in driving the metastatic cascade and suggest that CTC clusters could serve as important biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms that allow CTC clusters to retain their structure and survive in circulation opens new avenues for targeted cancer therapies designed to disrupt this process.


== Future directions ==
As research into the cancer exodus hypothesis progresses, new therapeutic strategies could emerge to specifically target CTC clusters. Blocking their formation, disrupting their cohesion, or preventing their ability to survive in the bloodstream could offer new ways to prevent metastasis in aggressive cancers. Continued studies will be essential to further elucidate the biological pathways involved in CTC cluster-mediated metastasis and develop potential treatment interventions.

Ore-pine,"Ore-pine (Norwegian: malmfuru; Swedish: malmfura; Danish: malmfyr; Icelandic: málmfura) is a cured pinewood used extensively in the Middle Ages in the construction of Scandinavian stave churches. Ore-pine is the heartwood of prepared old-growth mountain pines; the trees had their branches removed and were left to stand, the tree resins bleeding upward and out through the cut branches and thus making the heartwood more resinous. The resultant ore-pine is much more resistant to rot and decay, as evidenced by stave churches surviving from the 12th and 13th centuries.

Travel,"Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.


== Etymology ==
The origin of the word ""travel"" is most likely lost to history. The term ""travel"" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil).
In English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means ""three stakes"", as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier, depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock cart.


== Purpose and motivation ==

Reasons for traveling include recreation, holidays, rejuvenation, tourism or vacationing, research travel, the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel for charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business travel, trade, commuting, obtaining health care, waging or fleeing war, for the enjoyment of traveling, or other reasons. Travelers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains, ferries, boats, cruise ships and airplanes.
Motives for travel include:

Pleasure
Relaxation
Discovery and exploration
Adventure
Intercultural communications
Taking personal time for building interpersonal relationships.
Avoiding stress
Forming memories


== History ==
Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. Humankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century when aircraft allows travel from Spain to the United States overnight.
Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels toured, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars. Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally and internationally.
In the late 16th century, it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the Grand Tour, and included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome. However, the French Revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.
Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together. Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots. Air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.


== Geographic types ==
Travel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or international. In some countries, non-local internal travel may require an internal passport, while international travel typically requires a passport and visa. Tours are a common type of travel. Examples of travel tours are expedition cruises, small group tours, and river cruises.


== Safety ==

Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety. When traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be subject to difficulties, crime and violence. Some safety considerations include being aware of one's surroundings, avoiding being the target of a crime, leaving copies of one's passport and itinerary information with trusted people, obtaining medical insurance valid in the country being visited and registering with one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign country. Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most countries accept international driving permits. Automobile insurance policies issued in one's own country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited. It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving rules and regulations of destination countries. Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.
There are three main statistics which may be used to compare the safety of various forms of travel (based on a Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions survey in October 2000):

Digital euro,"A Digital Euro, is the project of the European Central Bank (ECB) to plan and possibly introduce of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). 
The aim of the project is to develop a fast and secure digital currency bound to the Euro. Individuals and businesses could use it additionally to Euro in cash and in bank accounts, and would be issued by the European System of Central Banks of the Eurozone. The study phase will run from October 2021 to October 2023 and will prepare a decision on the introduction. 


== Arguments and motivations for introducing a digital euro ==
Arguments and motives for the introduction of a digital euro are, according to the ECB:

Maintain the role of central bank money as a monetary anchor for the payment system.
Provide free digital access to a secure legal tender in the Eurozone
Expanding payment options through alternative central bank money alongside cash and book money in commercial bank accounts, contributing to availability and inclusion
Building trust in digital cash through a high level of privacy protection
Promote innovation in retail payments
Limiting the spread of foreign digital currencies to safeguard the financial stability and monetary sovereignty of the Eurozone
In addition to these motives, the possibility of a further decline in the use of cash as a means of payment plays a role in the discussion on the digital euro.


== Preparations for the possible introduction of a digital euro ==
On October 2, 2020, the ECB published a report outlining the introduction of a digital euro from the perspective of the Eurosystem.
Since 2020, several projects have been launched in collaboration with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to test the issuance, control and transfer of central bank digital currency, as well as securities tokens and smart contracts on a blockchain.


=== 2021 ===
Following preliminary planning and the presentation of the results of a public consultation in early 2021, the ECB decided in July 2021 to launch a digital euro project to prepare for the possible introduction of a digital euro. No technical barriers were identified during the preliminary planning. The research, which is scheduled to run until autumn 2023, aims to shed light on the distribution to merchants and citizens, the impact on markets and the necessary European legislation. No preliminary decision has therefore been taken on the introduction of the digital euro.


=== 2022 ===
In September 2022, the ECB announces a collaboration with five companies (Amazon, CaixaBank, Worldline, EPI and Nexi) to develop potential user interfaces for the digital euro.
Burkhard Balz, a member of the Bundesbank's Executive Board, sees the digital euro not least as a means of strengthening European sovereignty in payments. In his view, the digital euro could be designed to support programmable payments in a highly automated environment.
The first progress report on the investigation phase (""Progress on the investigation phase of a digital euro"") was published by the ECB in September 2022.
Speaking at the conference ""Towards a legislative framework enabling a digital euro for citizens and businesses"" held in Brussels in early November 2022, Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, reiterated that the digital euro is not a stand-alone project limited to the area of payments. Rather, it is a cross-policy and truly European initiative that has the potential to have an impact on society as a whole.
In December 2022, the ECB published the second progress report on the investigation phase.


=== 2023 ===
In January 2023, the ECB invited experts in the field of payments/finance to express their interest in contributing to the development of a set of rules for the digital euro.
At the end of May 2023, the ECB published the results of a market research and prototyping project. The market research had shown that there was a sufficiently large pool of European vendors capable of developing digital euro solutions. It had also shown that different types of architectural and technological design options were available to develop a technical solution for a digital euro. The prototyping project involved the integration of five user interfaces developed by different vendors for each use case (front-end prototypes) and a settlement system designed and developed by the Eurosystem (back-end prototype). Different design options were tested to determine whether they could be technically implemented and integrated into the Eurosystem's settlement system. The tests showed that it would be possible to integrate a digital euro smoothly into the existing payment landscape, while leaving room for the market to use innovative features and technologies in the dissemination of a digital euro. The results also confirmed that, in principle, a digital euro could function both online and offline using different technical concepts. The question remains whether an offline solution that meets the Eurosystem's requirements and achieves the necessary scale can be implemented in the short to medium term using existing technology.


== Views on the possible introduction of a digital euro ==
The Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband (Public German Consumer Protection Organisation) sees the digital euro as a public good and thus an opportunity to make digital payments more consumer-oriented.
The German Informatics Society (GI) sees the introduction of a digital euro and the simultaneous decline of cash as a threat to informational self-determination and privacy; there is a danger of the ""Gläsnerer Mensch"" (German metaphor for data protection, representing the complete ""screening"" of people and their behavior by a monitoring state, which is perceived as negative).


=== Banking industry ===
From the perspective of the German Banking Industry Committee, the global trend toward central bank digital currency is unmistakable and represents both an opportunity and a challenge. The planned introduction of a digital euro is seen as an important contribution to the digitalization of the economy and society and to securing Europe's sovereignty and competitiveness. The digital money ecosystem proposed in a policy paper is intended to go beyond digital cash and consists of three elements:

Retail CBDC for personal use
Wholesale CBDC for banks and savings banks
Giral money tokens for industrial use
The Association of German Banks supports the introduction of a digital euro. In a position paper published in February 2023, the private banks emphasize the evolution of cash, their role in its issuance, its openness to innovation, and their desire to minimize the risks of its introduction. Among the risks, the private banks specifically mention those affecting their business (disintermediation, diminishing returns, weakening of their customer relationship) and that a weakening of their investment capabilities could lead to the failure of the digital euro.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BdV) welcomes the ECB's plans for a digital euro, but criticizes that the needs of the economy for a future digital payment method have not yet been sufficiently taken into account.


=== Industrial sector ===
In a position paper published at the end of September 2022, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI, Federation of German Industries) warns that the needs of the industry must be taken into account when introducing a digital euro. The programmability of payments is a key demand. of payments is a central requirement. 


=== Eurogroup ===
For Paschal Donohoe, president of the Eurogroup, a body of finance ministers from euro member states, the digital euro project is about maintaining the link between citizens and central bank money: as central bank money, the digital euro would be convertible one-to-one into euro banknotes.
Unlike the industry, the Eurogroup does not want the digital euro to be equipped with additional functions.


=== European Commission ===
In June 2023, the European Commission proposed in a draft regulation on the introduction of the digital euro that a digital euro should be made available as a legal tender not only to banks, but above all to the general public. The Commission wants to design the processing of digital euro transactions in such a way that neither the European Central Bank nor the national central banks can attribute data to an identified or identifiable digital euro user.

Oxygen therapy,"Oxygen therapy, also called supplemental oxygen, is when oxygen gas (O2) is used for medical treatment by giving the gas to the patient for inhalation. It can be used for ilnesses like  hypoxia, carbon monoxide toxicity, and cluster headaches. It can be used over a long time for people who suffer with illnesses that lower oxygen levels in the blood like COPD and cystic fibrosis. It can be given in a few different ways such as through a nasal cannula, face mask, or inside a hyperbaric chamber. Oxygen levels need to be high enough for respiration to keep a patient healthy and for normal cell metabolism.

Backdraft,"A backdraft (North American English), backdraught (British English) or smoke explosion is the abrupt burning of superheated gases in a fire caused when oxygen rapidly enters a hot, oxygen-depleted environment; for example, when a window or door to an enclosed space is opened or broken. Backdrafts are typically seen as a blast of smoke and/or flame out of an opening of a building. Backdrafts present a serious threat to firefighters.  There is some debate concerning whether backdrafts should be considered a type of flashover.


== Burning ==
When material is heated enough, it begins to break down into smaller compounds, including flammable or even explosive gas, typically hydrocarbons. This is called pyrolysis, and does not require oxygen. If oxygen is also provided, then the hydrocarbons can combust, starting a fire.
If material undergoing pyrolysis is later given sufficient oxygen, the hydrocarbons will ignite, and therefore, combustion takes place.


== Cause ==

A backdraft can occur when a compartment fire has little or no ventilation. Due to this, little or no oxygen can flow into the compartment. Then, because fires reduce oxygen, the oxygen concentration decreases. When the oxygen concentration becomes too low to support combustion, some or all of the combustion switches to pyrolysis. However, the hydrocarbons and smoke (primarily particulate matter) remain at a temperature hot enough to auto-ignite. If oxygen is then re-introduced to the compartment, e.g. by opening a door or window to a closed room, while the gasses are still hot enough to auto-ignite, combustion will restart, often abruptly or even explosively, as the gasses are heated by the combustion and expand rapidly because of the rapidly increasing temperature, combined with the energy released from combustion.
The colour and movement of smoke is used by firefighters to infer fire conditions, including the risk of backdraft. Characteristic warning signs of a backdraft include yellow or brown smoke, smoke which exits small holes in puffs (a sort of breathing effect) and is often found around the edges of doors and windows, and windows which appear brown or black when viewed from the exterior due to soot from incomplete combustion. This is an indication that the room lacks enough oxygen to permit oxidation of the soot particles. Firefighters often look to see if there is soot on the inside of windows and in any cracks in the window (caused e.g. by the heat). The windows may also have a slight vibration due to varying pressure within the compartment due to intermittent combustion.
If firefighters discover a room sucking air into itself, for example through a crack, they generally evacuate immediately, because this is a strong indication that a backdraft is imminent. Due to pressure differences, puffs of smoke are sometimes drawn back into the enclosed space from which they emanated, which is how the term backdraft originated.
Backdrafts are very dangerous, often surprising even experienced firefighters. The most common tactic used by firefighters to defuse a potential backdraft is to ventilate a room from its highest point, allowing the heat and smoke to escape without igniting.
Common signs of imminent backdraft include a sudden inrush of air upon an opening into a compartment being created, lack of visible signs of flame (fire above its upper flammability limit), ""pulsing"" smoke plumes from openings and auto-ignition of hot gases at openings where they mix with oxygen in the surrounding air. 


== Backdrafts and flashovers ==
Although ISO 13943 defines flashover as ""transition to a state of total surface involvement in a fire of combustible materials within an enclosure"", a broad definition that embraces several different scenarios, including backdrafts, there is nevertheless considerable disagreement regarding whether or not backdrafts should be properly considered flashovers. The most common use of the term flashover is to describe the near-simultaneous ignition of material caused by heat attaining the autoignition temperature of the combustible material and gases in an enclosure. Flashovers of this type are not backdrafts as they are caused by thermal change. Backdrafts are caused by the introduction of oxygen into an enclosed space with conditions already suitable for ignition, and are thus caused by chemical change.


== In popular culture ==
Backdrafts were publicized by the 1991 movie Backdraft, in which a serial arsonist in Chicago uses them as a means of assassinating conspirators in a scam.
In the film adaptation of Stephen King's 1408, the protagonist Mike Enslin induces one as a last-ditch effort to kill the room.
The term is also used and is the title of a scene in the 2012 video game Root Double: Before Crime * After Days.

Accounting software,"Accounting software is a program that can run on a computer to track the total value of a company. Accounting software can be downloaded to a computer or can be used through a browser window by logging into a website.
Before computers all accounting information was stored in books called ""ledgers"". A general ledger was the book where the accountant wrote down all payments that came into a company and all payments that were made. A common term for keeping track of this information is called ""keeping the books"". A bookkeeper is another term for an accountant, but can sometimes means a person who does accounting but maybe doesn't have as much formal education as an accountant.
Accounting software can automate many of the more menial tasks of accounting. For example, many accounting software companies automatically pull in bank information. Instead of having to put in the payments made and cashed received, the program does it for you.

Pixelization,Pixelization is a way of hiding information from a picture. It is often used to censor pictures or movies that are inappropriate. It is also used to hide someone's face if they do not wish to be seen.,0
Phallus,"The word phallus refers to an erect penis, to a penis-shaped object such as a dildo, or to a mimetic image of an erect penis.
Any object that symbolically resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus, or as being phallic (as in 'phallic symbol'). Such symbols represent the fertility associated with the male sexual organ, and the male orgasm.


== Culture ==


=== Symbol of sex and fertility ===
When an erect penis is shown in art, it is often called a phallus (pronounced FA-ləs). Erotic (sexually exciting) art has shown phalluses for a very long time. Pictures of men with erections appear on ancient objects and in paintings.
The erect penis was also a symbol or sign of health and fertility (the ability to give life). The Hohle Fels phallus was found in a cave in Germany. It is a piece of stone carved to look like a penis that is about 28,000 years old.
From the fourth millennium B.C. (4000–3001 B.C.), Ancient Egyptians worshipped Min as the god of reproduction and the maker of all things. Min was shown in statues and on wall carvings as having an erect penis.


=== Ancient Greece ===
The Ancient Greeks believed in a god called Priapus who had a very large penis that was always erect. He was thought to protect livestock (animals kept by humans for food, milk, leather or wool), fruit plants and gardens, and men's sex organs. He was also seen as able to chase away evil, and as a protector of sailors, fishermen and others needing good luck. The oldest piece of writing about Priapus that is known is a comedy (a funny or silly play) written some time in the fourth century B.C. (400–301 B.C.). In Greek mythology, Priapus tried to attack a nymph (a female spirit) named Lotis who was sleeping so he could force her to have sex. However, a donkey brayed – it gave a loud cry. This made him lose his erection, and also woke Lotis up. To save Lotis, the gods turned her into a lotus plant. In the end, Priapus's lust – his strong desire to have sex – made him have an erection all the time, and his penis grew so large that he could not move. Although some temples were built for people to pray to Priapus, he was mostly worshipped in people's homes or gardens. Donkeys would sometimes be killed and offered to him, but gifts of fish, flowers, fruit and vegetables were also very common. Statues of Priapus were often placed at doorways and crossroads (places where two roads crossed). To make Priapus happy, people passing by would stroke the statue's penis.


==== Herma ====

A Herma, or herm, is a sculpture with a head, and perhaps a torso, above a plain, usually squared lower section, on which male genitals may also be carved at the appropriate height. The form originated in Ancient Greece, and was adopted by the Romans, and revived at the Renaissance.
In ancient Greece the statues had an apotropaic function, and were placed at crossings and borders as protection. Hermes was a phallic god, associated with fertility, luck, roads and borders. His name comes from the word herma. In Athens, they were placed outside houses for good luck and protection. They would be adorned with garlands or wreaths and anointed with olive oil to obtain luck.


== Modern views ==
Today, phalluses do not often appear in artworks or movies (except in pornographic movies which show people having sex with each other). This is because many people think that showing a man's penis when it is erect is obscene (not decent).

The goal of asthmatic agents is to reduce asthma exacerbation frequencies and related hospital visits.
Anti-asthmatic agents as rescue medications for acute asthma attacks include short-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (SABA), short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA), systemic glucocorticoids, and magnesium sulfate. Anti-asthmatic agents as maintenance medications for asthmatic symptom control include long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (LABA), inhaled glucocorticoids, long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), methylxanthines/phosphodiesterase inhibitors, leukotriene receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, and certain types of monoclonal antibodies.
Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA) is the official guideline on the usage of anti-asthmatic agents. The GINA guideline outlines the class, dosage, and administration of anti-asthmatic agents prescription depending on the severity of asthma symptoms and nature.


== Rescue medications ==


=== Inhaled short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists ===

Inhaled short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, such as terbutaline and salbutamol, are the first-line drugs indicated for asthma exacerbation for all patients to provide rapid bronchodilating effects. Short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists can be delivered by different devices, for example, nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers.
β2-adrenergic agonists can trigger the activation of Gs protein-coupled β2-adrenergic receptors on the airway smooth muscle cells in the lungs. The β2-adrenergic receptors activation allows the adenylyl cyclase within the airway smooth muscle cells to catalyse the conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP as a second messenger further activates protein kinase A and decreases the intracellular calcium level, causing subsequent smooth muscle relaxation.
Common side effects of inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists include tremors, palpitations and headache. The incidence and severity of side effects depend on the dose and route of administration of the β2-adrenergic agonists.


=== Inhaled short-acting muscarinic antagonists ===
Inhaled short-acting muscarinic antagonists, such as oxitropium and ipratropium, can be used as an adjunct therapy with short-acting β2-adrenergic agonists in moderate to severe asthma exacerbations to achieve bronchodilation. Short-acting muscarinic antagonists are usually discontinued upon hospital admission due to a lack of benefits among hospitalized patients. 
Muscarinic antagonists can compete with acetylcholine for muscarinic receptors and provide an antagonistic effect on muscarinic receptors, causing inhibition of cholinergic bronchomotor tone and hence bronchodilation.
Inhaled muscarinic antagonists commonly cause dry mouth, throat irritation and dizziness. 


=== Systemic glucocorticoids ===
Systemic glucocorticoids, such as oral prednisolone and intravenous hydrocortisone, are indicated for  moderate to severe asthma exacerbation to reduce airway inflammation. It is important for patients with refractory asthma exacerbation who are already on intensive bronchodilator therapy as airflow resistance in the airway is likely to be caused by mucus accumulation and inflammation on the airway.
Systemic administration of glucocorticoids can reduce airway mucus production. It can also suppress inflammatory responses by inhibiting the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators and lowering the infiltration and activity of inflammatory cells.  Additionally, glucocorticoids can increase the amount of β2-adrenergic receptors and their sensitivity towards β2-adrenergic agonists on the airway smooth muscles.
The use of systemic glucocorticoids may cause depressed immunity, osteoporosis and Cushing’s syndrome. The side effects of glucocorticoids depend on the dose and duration of treatment.


=== Magnesium Sulfate ===
Magnesium sulfate is indicated for severe or life-threatening asthma exacerbation to achieve bronchodilation.
Intravenous magnesium sulfate can reduce calcium ions influx into smooth muscle cells on the airway, causing airway muscle relaxation.
It is possible for intravenous magnesium sulfate to cause hypermagnesemia, resulting in muscle weakness. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency.


== Maintenance medications ==


=== Long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists ===

Long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, for example, vilanterol, indacaterol, olodaterol, formoterol and salmeterol, are commonly used together with inhaled corticosteroid in maintenance treatment.


=== Inhaled glucocorticoids ===
Inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used together with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists in maintenance therapy as corticosteroids can increase the amount of airway bronchial β2-receptors and their sensitivity towards β2-selective agents. 
The use of inhaled corticosteroid may commonly cause dysphonia and overgrowth of oropharyngeal candidiasis. The risk of overgrowth of oropharyngeal candidiasis can be reduced by rinsing the mouth with water after use.


=== Long-acting muscarinic antagonists ===
Long-acting muscarinic antagonists, including tiotropium, aclidinium and umeclidinium, are indicated for severe asthma in maintenance treatment.
Muscarinic antagonists can reduce cholinergic bronchomotor tone, resulting in airway muscle relexation and bronchodilation.
Muscarinic antagonists commonly cause dry mouth, throat irritation and dizziness.


=== Methylxanthine / Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors ===
Methylxanthines, including theophylline, aminophylline and dyphylline, are a class of drugs that can achieve bronchodilation and reduce bronchospasm for symptomatic control of asthma.
Methylxanthines act as a competitive inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, inhibiting phosphodiesterase degradation action of cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This resulted accumulation of cAMP relaxes smooth muscles, leading to dilation of airways.
Methylxanthines activate histone deacetylases, promoting the deacetylation of histone and subsequent DNA folding. This inhibits the synthesis of pro-inflammatory factors that induce asthma attacks and exacerbations, achieving anti-inflammatory effects.
For asthma maintenance therapy, methylxanthines are taken orally.
Therapeutic drug monitoring is required for patients on methylxanthines as the therapeutic range is narrow. Methylxanthines are not routinely used owing to their adverse effect profiles and the risk of toxicity. Adverse effects of Methylxanthines include nervousness, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, vomiting), tremor, palpitation and increased urine output.


=== Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists ===
Leukotriene receptor antagonists, including montelukast and zafirlukast, inhibit pro-inflammatory leukotrienes bindings to LTC4 and LTD4 receptors. This blocks the downstream inflammatory pathways that lead to bronchospasm and smooth muscle contractions in asthmatic patients.
Leukotriene receptor antagonists are taken orally.
Common adverse effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists include headache, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.


=== Mast cell stabilizers ===
Mast Cell Stabilizers, including sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium, amlexanox, pemirolast potassium, repirinast and tranilast are drugs that inhibit the degranulation and activation of mast cells upon contact with antigen. This prevents the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as histamines and leukotrienes. Mast cell stabilizers are given as prophylactic treatment to prevent exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms.
For asthma maintenance therapy, mast cell stabilizers are taken by inhalation.
Common adverse effects of Mast cell stabilizers include mouth dryness, cough, throat irritation, nasal congestion and bronchospasm.


=== Monoclonal Antibodies ===
Monoclonal Antibodies that aid in asthma symptomatic control include omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab and tezepelumab.
Omalizumab binds to free human immunoglobulin (IgE) to reduce IgE level in circulation. This reduces the subsequent binding of IgE to the IgE receptors on inflammatory cells, including mast cells, basophils and dendritic cells. The release of inflammatory mediators is then prevented.
Mepolizumab and reslizumab inhibit Interleukin (IL)-5 binding with IL-5 receptors on the surface of eosinophils, inhibiting subsequent inflammatory responses.
Benralizumab blocks the IL-5 receptors on basophils, preventing binding of IL-5 with IL-5 receptors on basophils, inhibiting subsequent inflammatory responses.
Dupilumab blocks IL-4 receptors, inhibiting subsequent inflammatory activities of IL-4 and IL-13.
Tezepelumab binds to thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which is an inflammatory cytokine in the airway epithelial cells involved in asthma exacerbations, inhibiting subsequent inflammatory responses.
Monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of asthmatic symptoms are given by subcutaneous injections.
Common adverse effects include local site reactions, joint pain, back pain, headache and sore throat.


== Treatment steps ==


=== GINA guideline ===
According to the Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA), the guideline for anti-asthmatic treatment is divided into 5 levels according to asthma severity.
For newly diagnosed asthma patients, the 5 levels derived from the severity of asthma depend on the occurrence of symptoms and their frequencies. These symptoms include bronchoconstriction, shortness of breath and wheezing that exacerbates after physical activities. Frequent coughing, chest tightness and breathing difficulties are also signs of asthma worsening. These symptoms can interfere with a patient's daily living and affect quality of life. These 5 levels are indicators of what drug treatments should be administered. The guideline is as follows:
Step 1-2: Symptoms less than 4–5 days a week

Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol combination therapy when required
 Step 3: Symptoms most days, or waking with asthma once a week or more 

Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol maintenance therapy
 Step 4: Daily symptoms, or waking with asthma once a week or more, and low lung function 

Medium dose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol maintenance therapy
Short-course oral corticosteroids when required in severely uncontrolled asthma
Step 5: Further worsening of symptoms and increased occurrence of exacerbations 

Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists
Refer for phenotypic assessment with or without biologic therapy
Consider high dose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol maintenance therapy
Consider Anti-IgE, anti-iL5/5R, anti-IL4Rα or anti-TSLP


==== Reliever: As-needed-only low dose ICS-formoterol ====
The rationale behind using inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol combination therapy as a reliever as opposed to salbutamol, a short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist, is that this dosage regimen shows a reduction in the severe asthma exacerbation risk compared with using β2-adrenergic agonists reliever. As inhaled formoterol medications are often accompanied by a corticosteroid, this combination is a simpler regimen for patients as it utilizes the same formulation for both reliever and maintenance therapy as well as providing a long duration of bronchodilation effect.

Suspension (vehicle),"Suspension is the term given to the system of springs, shock absorbers and linkages.  The suspension acts as an intermediate between the car and the road and solves several problems:  

Transfer to the frame or body of forces and moments arising from the interaction of wheels with the road surface;
Link wheels with body or frame;
Provides the necessary for the normal movement of the position of the wheels relative to the frame or body and the road;
Ensures acceptable running smoothness, compensates for uneven pavement.
So a car suspension is not just a set of components for connecting wheels and body or frame, but a complex system that makes normal and comfortable movement on car driving.


== Springs ==
Springs are elastic elements of a car suspension that work in conjunction with shock absorbers. The main functions of the springs are:

maintaining vehicle clearance under increased loads;
ensuring reliable tire contact with the road surface;
supporting and even distribution of vehicle weight;
exclude transmission of vibrations and other effects on the car body.


== Shock absorbers ==
Shock absorbers, as a damping element of a modern suspension, convert vibrational energy into heat. The amount of energy absorbed depends on the mass of the car, the stiffness of the spring and the vibration frequency.
The principle of operation of dampers is based on the displacement of fluid by a piston through special holes. In various modes, fluid is displaced through openings of different diameters. Due to this, the oscillations are absorbed both during compression and during rebound. As a result, these car suspension parts provide:

vehicle traffic safety;
control of the movement of the spring and suspension;
efficient car control;
axial braking force balance;
prevention of early tire wear;
monitoring of tire contact with the road surface;
control of swinging and oscillations about the vertical axis;
decrease in wearing of knots and units of the car.


== Linkages ==
Using these elements, the suspension parts are fastened together, and also the suspension is attached to the body or frame of the car. The fasteners can be either a regular bolted connection (like other types of rigid joints), or a connection using special elastic elements - rubber-metal hinges (or silent-blocks).

Alkaline copper quaternary,"Alkaline copper quaternary, usually abbreviated ACQ, is a type of water-based wood preservative product containing  a soluble copper(II) complex and quaternary ammonium alkyl- or aryl-substituted compounds (""quats"").  Thus the product was originally called ammoniacal copper/quaternary ammonium.


== Composition ==


=== Copper complex ===
The copper in the preparation is in the form of a soluble complex with ammonia NH3 or an amine such as ethanolamine N(C2H5)H2.  In any case, the copper content is usually expressed as a weight percentage of the amount of copper oxide CuO that would account for the copper present.
As a copper carrier, ammonia has the advantage that it will penetrate difficult-to-treat Western species better than other waterborne preservatives. Otherwise ethanolamine is preferred as copper carrier.


=== Quaternary ammonium cations ===
Quaternary ammonium cations


==== DDA ====
The quaternary ammonium cation in some formulations is didecyldimethylammonium (DDA) N+(CH3)2(C10H21)2.
DDA is commercially produced as the carbonate, under the trade name ""Carboquat"".  The carbonate is used instead of the chloride to reduce corrosion of the treatment equipment.
DDA carbonate is non-volatile and highly soluble in water, with near zero octanol-water partition coefficient.


==== ADBA ====
Another quaternary ammonium cation used in some formulations is alkyldimethylbenzylammonium (ADBA). The formula is N+(CH2)2(C6H5)(CnH2n+1), where n varies between 8 and 18.


=== Counterions ===
Both the copper complex and the quats are positive cations.  The counterions (the anions that balance their positive charges) are typically hydroxide HO−, chloride Cl−, carbonate CO2−3 or bicarbonate HCO−3.


=== Standard formulations ===
Formulations of ACQ differ in the ""carrier"" (complexing agent for copper), either ammonia or ethanolamine; and on the quaternary ammonium cation present. Types registered in the US and Canada:

ACQ-A: copper-ethanolamine (50% CuO equivalent), and DDA chloride (50%).
ACQ-B: copper-ammonia (66.7% CuO) and DDA chloride (33.3%).  Not currently registered for use in Canada.
ACQ-C: copper-ammonia and/or copper-ethanolamne (66.7% CuO) and ADBA chloride (30%).
ACQ-D: copper-ethanolamine (66.7% CuO) and DDA chloride or carbonate (33.3%).
The ACQ Type D formulation also contains two moldicides: 2-methyl-4- isothiazolin-3-one and 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one.
The ammonia carrier ACQ-B improves its ability to penetrate into wood that is difficult to treat, like some US Western lumber.  The formulations with ethanolamine, especially ACQ-D, are generally used for easier woods (such as southern pine) because it provides a more uniform surface appearance.


== Mechanism of action ==
During the wood treatment process, the water-soluble copper and the quaternary ammonium cations are immobilized by the formation of stable insoluble compounds with  lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose and other wood components.
The copper is the primary bactericide and fungicide agent.
The quaternary ammonium cation is added to prevent growth of copper-tolerant bacteria, fungus, and mold, as an insecticide.


== Use ==
ACQ is applied at a timber treatment plants by industrial vacuum-pressure impregnation. Bunks of dried lumber are loaded into a long (up to 150') cylindrical container, seven feet in diameter.  The bunks ride on a rail system at the bottom of the cylinder.  Once filled, the container is subjected to a hard vacuum, drawing all the air and any remaining moisture out of the wood.  Then, the cylinder is filled nearly full of the ACQ solution and a pressure of 150PSI is applied for several hours to force the solution completely into the wood.  After the solution has been pumped out, a vacuum is applied again, to remove excess solution from the wood. {https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/basics-of-pressure-treatment-of-wood.html} 2022-4-13
Bunk sizes: 2×4 have 294 pcs, 2×6 have 189 pcs, 2×8 YP have 96 pcs, 2×10 YP have 80 pcs, and 2×12 YP have 64 pcs.  (YP= Yellow Pine) The lumber is usually eight, twelve, or sixteen feet long, but can be longer.
The ACQ-C product is normally shipped from manufacturer as a concentrated solution that is diluted at the wood treatment plant.  ACQ-D and ACQ-A are shipped as two separate solutions that are mixed and diluted at the latter.
In the US and other countries, ACQ is registered for use on lumber, timbers, landscape ties, fence posts, building and utility poles, land, freshwater and marine pilings, sea walls, decking, wood shingles, and other wood structures.


=== Treated wood color ===
Wood treated with ACQ has greenish-brown color which may fade to brown, and may have a slight ammonia odor until the wood dries.


== Safety ==
In the treated wood, the copper is relatively harmless and not an environmental or health concern.
DDA chloride is approved as germicide, fungicide, and algicide for disinfectant products that have been used for decades in hospitals and other commercial and industrial establishments.
ADBA chloride has been used in commercial products in the US since 1947. A registration standard was
issued by EPA in 1985.
One disadvantage of ACQ is that significant amounts of air pollution, in the form of ammonia, are released from treatment plants and freshly treated wood in storage yards.  While the CCA components are far more toxic in a weight basis, being non-volatile solids they can be effectively contained.


=== Fastener corrosion ===
The copper in ACQ treated wood accelerates corrosion of galvanized steel fasteners (such as nails and screws) 10 times or more in comparison with CCA-treated wood.  Stainless steel (AISI 316) is not affected. Aluminium and Galvalum fasteners should be avoided. One should use fasteners made of hot-dipped galvanized steel, copper, or stainless steel.


== History ==
ACQ technology was developed and patented in Canada and improved in the U.S. It has been in commercial production in Europe, Japan and the U.S. since the late 1980s. Wood products treated with ACQ preservative were commercially produced in Canada for the first time in 2004.
ACQ became a widely used wood preservative after concerns were raised about possible environmental contamination by chromium and arsenic from wood treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA), through contact (especially in playgrounds), leaching, sawing and sanding, or burning. These concerns led to the virtual banning of CCA for residential purposes by the US EPA, in 2003-2004.
Chemical Specialties, Inc (CSI, now Viance) received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2002 for commercial introduction of ACQ.

Liminal space (aesthetic),"In internet aesthetics, liminal spaces are empty or abandoned places that are eerie or surreal. Liminal spaces are places that are usually busy that appear empty for an unnatural reason. Some research has shown that liminal spaces may appear eerie or strange because they fall into an uncanny valley of architecture. 
The aesthetic gained popularity in 2019 after a post on 4chan showing a liminal space called the Backrooms went viral. Since then, liminal space images have been posted across the internet, including on Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok.

Clinical handover,"Clinical handover (patient handover or handover) is the transfer of professional responsibility and accountability for some or all aspects of care for a patient, or group of patients, to another person or professional group on a temporary or permanent basis. 

When critical clinical information emerges or there is a risk to patient care, timely communication of this information to the appropriate person(s) is essential to ensuring patient safety and delivery of the right care. Failure in handover is a major source in preventable patient harm. Clinical handover is an international concern and Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries have developed risk reduction recommendations. 
It is important to define and agree on the minimum information content for clinical handovers relevant to a service or discipline. It may be helpful to consider what clinical and non-clinical information is time critical or significant to patient care, such as:

New critical diagnostic or test results that require a change to care
Changes in a patient’s physical and psychological condition, including unexpected deterioration or development of complications
Follow-up communication following a review of results.
Use of structured handover tools can help to provide a framework for communicating the minimum information content for clinical handovers. This may be supported by electronic clinical handover templates. 
Examples of clinical handover tools to help structure handover:

ISBAR (Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)
SHARED (Situation, History, Assessment, Risk, Expectation, Documentation)
I PASS the BATON (Introduction, Patient, Assessment, Situation, Safety concerns, Background, Actions, Timing, Ownership, Next).

Rinehart School of Sculpture,"The Rinehart School of Sculpture is the MFA granting sculpture program of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) located in Baltimore, Maryland. It was ranked in 2016 as the #3 MFA degree program in the country for sculpture by U.S. News & World Report.
When the American sculptor William Henry Rinehart died in 1874, he left most of his estate in trust for the purpose of ""aiding in the promotion of a more highly cultivated taste for art among the people of my native State, and of assisting young men in the study of the art of sculpture who desire to make it a profession."" Originally administered by the Peabody Institute, the Rinehart School of Sculpture opened in 1896 under MICA's leadership. In his name MICA established the Rinehart School of Sculpture and a Rinehart fellowship.
Notable alumni include Hans Schuler (1899), Elizabeth Turk (1994), Doug Hall (1969), and Mary Miss (1968). Notable faculty include Raymond Puccinelli (Dean, and sculpture instructor starting in 1958).
Past Directors of Rinehart have included J. Maxwell Miller (1923–1933), Hans Schuler (1925–1951), Tylden Streett (Acting Director 1960-1961), Norman Carlberg (1961-1998), Maren Hassinger (1998–2018). Jann Rosen-Queralt.(2018-2021).  
Dolores Zinny was appointed Rinehart School of Sculpture MFA in August 2021.
Rinehart is built on a small cohort; students are given direct one-on-one access to faculty and internationally renowned guests. The oldest program of its kind in the country, Rinehart expands and reinvents the tradition of sculptural practice.
Rinehart's spacious, individually assigned studios are one of the most vital aspects of the program, which opens onto a common work area with a comprehensive fabrication shop. 
Core to the program is the seminar room where peers interact, exchange ideas, and receive Guest Lecturers for critical readings and writing workshops, balancing intensive studio practice with a rigorous focus on history and critical theory.The Rinehart Seminar consists of weekly lectures and discussions led by Program Director Dolores Zinny and renowned visiting artists, curators & professionals from other disciplines, such as journalists, architects, and scientists. Recent visiting artists include Tony Cokes, Chakaia Brooker, Alexandra Grant, Coco Fusco, Matt Mullican. 
These outstanding professionals give public talks, engage in give-and-take class meetings and seminars, and have one-on-one consultations with students. This time provides students with a solid theoretical framework for positioning themselves and their artistic practice within current local and international dynamics. 
Each semester is focused on an exhibition and its evaluation; upon completing the MFA program, the students will have a four-exhibition portfolio.

Pycnanthus angolensis,"Pycnanthus angolensis is a species of tree in the nutmeg family, Myristicaceae. It is native to Tropical Africa. Its English language common names include African nutmeg, false nutmeg, boxboard, and cardboard. In Africa it is widely known as ilomba.


== Description ==
This evergreen tree grows up to 40 meters tall and usually up to a meter wide, sometimes up to 1.5 meters or more. The trunk is straight and cylindrical with fissures and flaking bark. The sap is honey-colored and turns red in time. The branches are in whorls. The leathery leaves are up to 31 centimeters long by 9 wide. The blades have pointed tips, heart-shaped bases, and thick midribs. They are hairless on top and coated with rusty, feltlike hairs on the undersides. The leaves usually bear signs of insect damage, a feature so common it is considered characteristic of the species. The flowers are arranged in dense, rusty panicles up to 15 centimeters long. The individual flowers are difficult to see in the tight panicle until the stamens develop, being only about a millimeter long. The flowers are hairy and fragrant. The fruit is a rounded drupe reaching over 3 centimeters long and wide, borne in clusters. It is hairy brown when new, turning yellow-orange, and has cartilaginous flesh that dries woody. It contains a black seed with a red aril which resembles that of nutmeg. The fruit ripens over a long period continuing into the next flowering season, which begins around October.


== Ecology ==
The tree grows in moist rainforests up to about 1200 meters in elevation among other evergreens and semideciduous trees. It occurs in secondary forest, sometimes taking hold in new canopy gaps or clearings. It thrives in sunny locations. It grows in riparian forests such as gallery forests, and in some regions it can be found in swamps. It occurs in areas receiving between about 1300 and 1800 millimeters of rain per year, but the optimal seems to be about 2000 millimeters.
Many animals feed on the fruits, such as hornbills.


== Uses ==
This species has a wide variety of human uses.
It is harvested for its wood, which is light, soft, and whitish gray or pink-tinged in color. Its popularity rose after World War II when plywood was in demand, and during the mid-20th century it was one of the more valuable timbers in Central Africa. It is not very durable and tends to warp, but it is easy to cut and work and can be used for many purposes. It is suitable for furniture, and in house construction as panelling, siding, roof shingles, and framing. It is used for fuel and paper pulp. The wood can be vulnerable to termites, powderpost beetles, and other pests.
The yellowish or reddish fat from the aromatic seed is called ""kombo butter"" or ""Angola tallow"". A seed can be up to 70% fat. It is used as a fuel for lighting and is made into soap. Seed remnants are used in compost. When ignited, the oily seed burns slowly and can be used as a candle.
In Uganda the tree is grown in banana, coffee, and cocoa plantations to shade the crops.
Most parts of the tree have been used in traditional African medicine. The sap has been used to control bleeding. The bark has been used as a poison antidote and a treatment for leprosy, anemia, infertility, gonorrhea, and malaria. Leaf extracts are consumed or used in an enema to treat edema. Root extracts are used to treat parasitic infections, such as schistosomiasis. The seed oil is used to treat thrush.
Like the fat of nutmeg, kombo butter is mostly myristic acid, with a high amount of myristoleic acid, as well. It contains the unique compound kombic acid, which was named for the tree under its nomenclatural synonym, P. kombo.


== Cultivation ==
This tree is cultivated for its products. Seeds are sown in the field, and seedlings are grown in plant nurseries until they have large taproots. They cannot tolerate drought. After a year the tree is about half a meter tall, and within 4 years it can reach 4 meters. A 20-year-old tree can be 25 meters tall. Stands of cultivated trees are pruned and thinned periodically.
Pest insects such as Monochamus scabiosus and Mallodon downesi and fungi such as Ophiostoma sp. have been observed, but they are not severe problems. The freshly harvested wood may become discolored due to bacterial growth, the light-colored wood developing dark brown staining.
Trees can be cut when they reach a diameter of 50 centimeters, at around 30 years old.
Agricultural cooperatives in Ghana cultivate the trees for the kombo butter.


== Common names ==
There are common names for the plant in many languages. It is called mkungu mwitu in Swahili, akwa-mili and oje in Igbo, lunaba and munaba in Luganda, akomu in Yoruba, calabo in Spanish, and arbre à suif and faux muscadier in French. Local names include pó casson in São Tomé and Príncipe, gboyei in Sierra Leone and Liberia, otie in Ghana, eteng in Cameroon, lolako in Zaire, and adria, effoi, hétéré, qualélé, and walélé in Ivory Coast.

Rational fideism,"Rational fideism is the philosophical view that considers faith to be precursor for any reliable knowledge.  Every paradigmatic system, whether one considers rationalism or empiricism, is based on axioms that are neither self-founding nor self-evident (see the Münchhausen trilemma), so it appeals to assumptions accepted as belief (in reason or experience respectively). Thus, faith is basic to knowability. On the other hand, such a conclusion is reached not with an act of faith but with reasoning, a rational argumentation.


== Definitions ==
""Rational fideism"" has been defined variously. The following are some definitions.
For Joseph Glanvill rational fideism is the view that ""Faith, and faith alone, is the basis for our belief in our reason. We believe in our reason because we believe in God's veracity. We do not try to prove that God is truthful; we believe this. Thus, faith in God gives us faith in reason, which in turn ""justifies"" our belief that God is no deceiver.""
Richard Popkin sees rational fideism as the opposite of ""pure, blind, fideism"".
Similarly, Domenic Marbaniang sees rational fideism as ""the view that the knowledge of God can be certified through faith alone that is based on a revelation that is rationally verified."" Observing that the way of both rationalism and empiricism towards the knowledge of ultimate or transcendent reality is bleak, he thinks that while fideism is the view that truth in religion rests solely on faith and not on a reasoning process, rational fideism ""holds that truth in religion rests solely on faith; not blind faith, but faith that can give rational and cogent answers or reason to warrant the belief.""
According to C. Stephen Evans, rational fideism involves the possibility of reason becoming self-critical. Seeing it as the kind of responsible fideism, he states, ""If human reason has limitations and also has some ability to recognise those limitations, then the possibility of responsible fideism emerges."" Evans states that not only does reason have limitations, it is also tainted by sin making one entitled to faith where reason fails.
Patrick J. Clarke defines rational fideism as the approach that sees ""reason as capable of providing the intellectual foundation of faith, not a priori but a posteriori, much as philosophy provides an intellectual foundation to theology.""


== Arguments for rational fideism ==
Brendan Sweetman notes a type of rational fideism as a view developed by some thinkers who hold that the pragmatic spiritual and moral success of believing in God on faith alone could be used as an ""indirect argument for the truth of fideism.""


== Arguments against rational fideism ==
R.C. Sproul, John Gerstner, and Arthur Lindsley argue that ""Rational fideism is a contradiction in terms"" since requiring a criterion for belief is non-fideistic as fideism begins with belief; that is, fideistic belief proceeds from faith rather than reaching faith as a result of rational query.

Glossary of astronomy,"This glossary of astronomy is a list of definitions of terms and concepts relevant to astronomy and cosmology, their sub-disciplines, and related fields. Astronomy is concerned with the study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth. The field of astronomy features an extensive vocabulary and a significant amount of jargon.


== A ==

A-type star
In the Harvard spectral classification system, a class of main-sequence star having spectra dominated by Balmer absorption lines of hydrogen. Stars of spectral class A are typically blue-white or white in color, measure between 1.4 and 2.1 times the mass of the Sun, and have surface temperatures of 7,600–10,000 kelvin.

absolute magnitude
A measure of a star's absolute brightness. It is defined as the apparent magnitude the star would show if it were located at a distance of 10 parsecs, or 32.6 light-years.

accretion disk
A roughly circular mass of diffuse material in orbit around a central object, such as a star or black hole. The material is acquired from a source external to the central object, and friction causes it to spiral inward towards the object.

active galactic nucleus (AGN)
A compact region in the center of a galaxy displaying a much higher than normal luminosity over some part of the electromagnetic spectrum with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by stars. A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an active galaxy.

albedo
A measure of the proportion of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body, such as a planet, that is diffusely reflected away from the body. It is a dimensionless quantity typically measured on a scale from 0 (indicating total absorption of all incident radiation, as by a black body) to 1 (indicating total reflection). The albedo reported for an astronomical body may vary widely by the spectral and angular distribution of the incident radiation, by the ""layer"" of the body being measured (e.g. upper atmosphere versus surface), and by local variation within these layers (e.g. cloud cover and geological or environmental surface features).

albedo feature
A large area on the surface of a reflecting object that shows a significant contrast in brightness or darkness (albedo) compared to adjacent areas.

Am star
A chemically peculiar star belonging to the more general class of A-type stars. The spectrum of the Am stars shows abnormal enhancements and deficiencies of certain metals. See metallicity.

aphelion
The point at which a body orbiting the Earth's Sun is furthest from the Sun. Contrast perihelion.

apoapsis
The point at which an orbiting body is furthest from its primary. Contrast periapsis.

apogee
The point at which a body orbiting the Earth (such as the Moon or an artificial satellite) is furthest from the Earth. Contrast perigee.

apparent magnitude
Also visual brightness (V).
A measure of the brightness of a celestial body as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter the object appears, the lower its magnitude.

appulse
The closest approach of one celestial object to another, as viewed from a third body.

     
apsis
In the orbit of a planetary body, one of the two extreme points of distance between the body and its primary – either the point of minimal distance, called the periapsis, or the point of maximal distance, called the apoapsis. The term may also be used to refer to the value of the distance rather than the point itself. All elliptical orbits have exactly two apsides.

argument of periapsis
Also argument of perifocus or argument of pericenter.
The angle from an orbiting body's ascending node to its periapsis, measured in the direction of motion. It is one of six canonical orbital elements used to characterize an orbit.

artificial satellite
An object that has been intentionally placed into orbit by humans, often around the Earth but also around other bodies within the Solar System. Contrast natural satellite.

ascending node
Also the north node.
The orbital node at which an orbiting object moves north through the plane of reference (in geocentric and heliocentric orbits) or at which the orbiting object moves away from the observer (in orbits outside of the Solar System). The position of the ascending node with respect to a reference direction, called the longitude of the ascending node, is used along with other parameters to describe an orbit. Contrast descending node.

aspect
The position of a planet or Earth's Moon with respect to the Sun, as viewed from Earth.

asterism
Any pattern of stars recognizable in Earth's night sky. An asterism may form part of an official constellation or it may be composed of stars from more than one constellation.

asteroid
A minor planet of the inner Solar System, i.e. one that orbits the Sun at a distance no greater than the orbit of Jupiter. Asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily distinguished from many different types of similar objects: small Solar System bodies primarily composed of dust and ice instead of mineral and rock are known as comets; bodies less than one meter in diameter are known as meteoroids; very large asteroids are sometimes called planetoids or planetesimals; and bodies similar to asteroids in size and composition but which lie beyond Jupiter are known as distant minor planets.

asteroid belt
The circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter that is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped small Solar System bodies ranging in size from dust particles to asteroids and minor planets. The asteroid belt is often called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in other parts of the Solar System.

astrobiology
Also exobiology.
An interdisciplinary field that studies the origins, evolution, distribution, and future of living systems in the universe, encompassing research on organic compounds in space, abiogenesis and extreme-environment adaptation on Earth, the habitability of extrasolar planets, the possible existence of extraterrestrial life, and how humans might be able to detect extraterrestrial biosignatures, among other topics.

astrodynamics
See orbital mechanics.

astrogeology
Also planetary geology.
A field that studies the geology of solidified bodies such as the planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, and meteorites. Investigations are centered around the composition, structure, processes, and history of these objects.

astrometric binary
A type of binary system where evidence for an unseen orbiting companion is revealed by its periodic gravitational perturbation of the visible component. See also spectroscopic binary.

astrometry
The branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies.

astronomical body
Also celestial body.
A type of naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure within the observable universe that is a single, tightly bound, contiguous structure, such as a star, planet, moon, or asteroid. Though the terms astronomical ""body"" and astronomical ""object"" are often used interchangeably, there are technical distinctions.

astronomical catalogue
Also spelled astronomical catalog.
A list of astronomical objects, typically grouped together because they share a common type, morphology, origin, means of detection, or method of discovery.

     
astronomical object
Also celestial object.
A type of naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure that exists within the observable universe but is a more complex, less cohesively bound structure than an astronomical body, consisting perhaps of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures, such as a planetary system, star cluster, nebula, or galaxy. Though the terms astronomical ""object"" and astronomical ""body"" are often used interchangeably, there are technical distinctions.

astronomical symbol
Any abstract pictorial symbol used to represent one or more astronomical objects, events, or theoretical constructs, e.g. those of the planets of the Solar System, the phases of the Moon, the zodiacal constellations, and the solstices and equinoxes. Many of these symbols were commonly used historically, though in the modern era they are usually limited to almanacs and astrology, and their appearance in scientific literature has become increasingly infrequent. Exceptions include the symbols for the Sun (☉), the Earth (🜨), and the Moon (☾), which are sometimes used for astronomical constants and in other forms of shorthand.

astronomical unit (AU)
A unit of length used primarily for measuring distances within the Solar System or secondarily between the Earth and distant stars. Originally conceived as the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the astronomical unit is now more rigidly defined as exactly 149,597,870.7 kilometres (92,956,000 miles; 4.8481×10−6 parsecs; 1.5813×10−5 light-years).

astronomy
The scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena, the origins of those objects and phenomena, and their evolution.

astrophotography

astrophysics
The branch of astronomy that employs principles of physics and chemistry to determine the nature of astronomical objects and phenomena, examining properties such as luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition (rather than the positions or motions of objects in space, which is more specifically the emphasis of celestial mechanics).

atmosphere
A gaseous envelope held in place by the gravity of a planet. This shell of gas has no clearly defined exterior boundary, but instead grows increasingly tenuous with altitude. The term can also be applied to a stellar atmosphere, referring to the visible outer layers of a star.

axial precession
A slow, continuous, gravity-induced change (a precession) in the orientation of an astronomical body's axis of rotation. The term often refers in particular to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's rotational axis with respect to its orbital plane over a cycle of approximately 25,772 years, which is caused predominantly by the gravitational influence of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's equatorial bulge. The phenomenon is similar to but much larger in magnitude than other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis such as nutation and polar motion, and is the cause of the apparent precession of the equinoxes in the night sky.

axial tilt
Also obliquity.
The angle between an object's rotational axis and its orbital axis, or, equivalently, the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane. Axial tilt usually does not change considerably during a single orbital period; Earth's axial tilt is the cause of the seasons. Axial tilt is distinct from orbital inclination.

axis of rotation

azimuth
An angular measurement of an object's orientation along the horizon of the observer, relative to the direction of true north. When combined with the altitude above the horizon, it defines an object's current position in the spherical coordinate system.


== B ==

barycenter
The common center of mass about which any two or more bodies of a gravitationally bound system orbit. The barycenter is one of the foci of the elliptical orbit of each body participating in the system; its location is strongly influenced by the mass of each body and the distances between them. For example, in a planetary system where the mass of the central star is significantly larger than the mass of an orbiting planet, the barycenter may actually be located within the radius of the star, such that the planet appears to orbit the star itself, though both bodies actually orbit the shared barycenter.

baryogenesis
The process by which the class of subatomic particles known as baryons were generated in the early Universe, including the means by which baryons outnumber antibaryons.

Big Bang
The prevailing cosmological model for the origin of the observable universe. It depicts a starting condition of extremely high density and temperature, followed by an ongoing expansion that led to the current conditions.

binary star
A star system consisting of exactly two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. The term is often used interchangeably with double star, though the latter can also refer to an optical double star, a type of optical illusion which is entirely distinct from true binary star systems.

black hole
A concentration of mass so compact that it creates a region of space from which not even light can escape. The outer boundary of this region is called the event horizon.

blazar

break-up velocity
Also critical velocity or critical rotation.
The surface velocity at which the centrifugal force generated by a rapidly spinning star matches the force of Newtonian gravity. At rotational velocities beyond this point, the star begins to eject matter from its surface.

brown dwarf
A substellar object that is too low in mass to sustain the nuclear fusion of hydrogen-1 in its core, with the latter being a characteristic of stars on the main sequence. Brown dwarfs can still generate energy from gravitational contraction and by the fusion of deuterium.

bulge


== C ==

Calibrator star
A star used for calibration of high-powered telescopes.

coudé spectrograph
This is a spectrograph placed at the Coudé focus of a reflecting telescope. The focus remains stationary as the telescope is re-oriented, which is advantageous for the stable mounting of heavy spectroscopic instruments.

celestial equator
The imaginary great circle of a body's celestial sphere that is coplanar with the body's terrestrial equator. On Earth, the plane of the celestial equator is the basis of the equatorial coordinate system. Due to Earth's axial tilt, this plane is currently inclined at an angle of 23.44 degrees with respect to the ecliptic.

celestial mechanics
The branch of astronomy that studies the motions of all types of astronomical objects, including stars, planets, and natural and artificial satellites, among others.

celestial meridian
See meridian.

celestial pole
One of two coordinates in the Earth's sky at which a hypothetical indefinite extension of the Earth's axis of rotation ""intersects"" the celestial sphere, i.e. the two points in the sky that are directly overhead the terrestrial North and South Poles, around which all fixed stars appear to revolve during the course of a day. The celestial poles form the north and south poles of the equatorial coordinate system.

celestial sphere
An imaginary sphere that encompasses the Earth's entire sky and is stationary with respect to the background stars. It is the basis for spherical astronomy.

centaur
A small Solar System body with either a perihelion or a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets, i.e. generally inward of the Kuiper belt but beyond the Jupiter trojans. Centaurs are cis-Neptunian objects that typically exhibit characteristics of both asteroids and comets, and generally also have unstable orbits because they cross the orbits of one or more of the giant planets.

central massive object (CMO)
Any very large concentration of mass at the center of a galaxy, typically either a supermassive black hole or a compact stellar nucleus, but sometimes both.

chromosphere

chromospheric activity index
A parameter indicating the magnetic activity in a star's chromosphere. One measure of this activity is log R′HK, where R′HK is the ratio of the equivalent width of a star's singly ionized calcium H and K lines, after correction for photospheric light, to the bolometric flux. Schröder et al. (2009) divide solar-type stars into four groups depending on their activity index: very active (log R′HK above −4.2), active (−4.2 to −4.75), inactive (−4.75 to −5.1), and very inactive (below −5.1).

circumstellar disc
Also spelled circumstellar disk.

cis-Neptunian object (CNO)

clearing the neighbourhood

color index
A numeric value that is used to compare the brightness of a star measured from different frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the energy output of a star varies by frequency as a function of temperature, the color index can be used to indicate the star's temperature.

comet
A relatively small, icy body that displays extended features when it approaches the Sun. The energy from the Sun vaporizes volatiles on a comet's surface, producing a visible coma around the cometary body. Sometimes a comet can produce a long tail radiating away from the Sun.

commensurability
A property of two objects orbiting the same body whose orbital periods are in a rational proportion. For example, the orbital period of Saturn around the Sun is very nearly 5/2 the orbital period of Jupiter.

common proper motion
A term used to indicate that two or more stars share the same motion through space, within the margin of observational error. That is, either they have nearly the same proper motion and radial velocity parameters, which may suggest that they are gravitationally bound or share a common origin, or they are known to be gravitationally bound (in which case their proper motions may be rather different but average to be the same over time).

compact star
Also compact object.
Any astronomical body with a very high mass relative to its radius, compared to most ordinary atomic matter. The term typically refers to very high-density objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, or to stellar remnants with very small radii.

compact stellar nucleus
See nuclear star cluster.

conjunction
A phenomenon during which two astronomical objects or spacecraft have either the same right ascension or the same ecliptic longitude as observed from a third body (usually the Earth), such that, from the observer's perspective, the objects appear to closely approach each other in the sky.

constellation
A region on the celestial sphere surrounding a specific and identifiable grouping of stars. The names of constellations are assigned by tradition and often have an associated folklore based in mythology, while the modern demarcation of their borders was established by the International Astronomical Union in 1930. Compare asterism.

corona
An aura of plasma that surrounds cooler stars such as the Sun. It can be observed during a solar eclipse as a bright glow surrounding the lunar disk. The temperature of the corona is much higher than that of the stellar surface, and the mechanism that creates this heat remains subject to debate among astronomers.

coronal loop

coronal mass ejection (CME)
A significant release of plasma and the accompanying magnetic field from the Sun's corona, often following a solar flare or present during a solar prominence eruption.

cosmic distance ladder

cosmic dust
Also space dust.
Dust which exists in outer space or has fallen on Earth, generally composed of fine particles of solid matter far smaller than those found in terrestrial dust.

cosmic microwave background (CMB)
Also cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR).

cosmic ray
A type of radiation consisting of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei which move through space at nearly the speed of light, and which may originate from the Sun or from outside the Solar System. Collisions of cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere can produce dramatic effects both in the air and on the surface.

cosmogony
Any model concerning the origin of either the universe or the cosmos.

cosmology
The scientific study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the Universe.

critical rotation

critical velocity
Also break-up velocity.
The surface velocity at the equator of a rotating body where the centrifugal force balances the Newtonian gravity. At this rotation rate, mass can be readily lost from the equator, forming a circumstellar disc. See also break-up velocity.

culmination
Also meridian transit.
The apparent movement of an astronomical object (e.g. the Sun, the Moon, a planet, a star, a constellation, etc.) across the observer's local meridian. During each day, the Earth's rotation causes every astronomical object to appear to move along a circular path on the celestial sphere, creating two points at which it crosses the meridian: an upper culmination, at which the object reaches its highest point above the horizon, and a lower culmination, at which it reaches its lowest point, nearly 12 hours later. When not otherwise qualified, the time of culmination typically refers to the time at which the upper culmination occurs.


== D ==

debris disk
A ring-shaped circumstellar disc of dust and debris orbiting its host star. It is created by collisions between planetesimals. A debris disk can be discerned from an infrared excess being emitted from the star system, as the orbiting debris re-radiates the star's energy into space as heat.

declination
In the equatorial coordinate system, the celestial equivalent of terrestrial latitude. Coordinates north of the celestial equator are measured in positive degrees from 0° to 90°, while coordinates to the south are measured in negative degrees. See also right ascension.

decretion disk
A circumstellar disc formed from gas ejected from a central star that now follows a nearly Keplerian orbit around it. This type of disk can be found around many Be stars.

deep-sky object (DSO)
Any astronomical object that is not an individual star or an object within the Earth's Solar System. The classification is used mostly in amateur observational astronomy to distinguish faint objects in the night sky such as star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies.

degenerate star
A star composed of degenerate matter, e.g. a white dwarf or a neutron star. These stars are in an advanced state of evolution and have suffered extreme gravitational collapse, such that normal atoms cannot exist in them.

descending node
Also the south node.
The orbital node at which an orbiting object moves south through the plane of reference (in geocentric and heliocentric orbits) or at which the orbiting object moves toward the observer (in orbits outside of the Solar System). Contrast ascending node.

detached object
Also distant detached object and extended scattered disc object.
A dynamical class of minor planet in the outer reaches of the Solar System whose point of closest approach to the Sun is so distant that the object is only moderately or weakly affected by the gravitational influence of Neptune and the other known planets, such that it appears to be ""detached"" from the rest of the Solar System. Detached objects are thus distinct from other populations of trans-Neptunian objects, such as cubewanos and scattered disc objects.

direct motion
See prograde motion.

diurnal motion
The apparent motion of an astronomical object (e.g. the Sun, a planet, or a distant star) around the two celestial poles in the Earth's night sky over the course of one day. Diurnal motion is caused by Earth's rotation about its own axis, such that every object appears to follow a circular path called the diurnal circle.

double star
Any pair of stars which appear near each other on the celestial sphere, either because the two stars coincidentally lie along nearly the same line of sight from the Earth, though they are in fact physically distant from each other, or because the two stars are actually located in physical proximity to each other, by which they may form a co-moving pair or a binary star system.

dwarf planet

dwarf star
Any star belonging to a category of ordinary main-sequence stars like the Sun, in contrast to evolved giant stars like Betelgeuse and Antares. Confusingly, the term has also come to include stellar remnants known as white dwarfs as well as low-mass substellar objects known as brown dwarfs.


== E ==

early-type star
A hotter and more massive star, in contrast to late-type stars that are cooler and less massive. The term originated from historical stellar models that assumed stars began their early life at a high temperature then gradually cooled off as they aged. It may be used to refer to the higher-temperature members of any particular population or category of stars, rather than of all stars in general.

eccentricity
See orbital eccentricity.

ecliptic
Also ecliptic plane or plane of the ecliptic.
The plane defined by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Hence, the position of the Sun as viewed from the Earth defines the intersection of this plane with the celestial sphere. The ecliptic is widely used as a reference plane for describing the position of other Solar System bodies within various celestial coordinate systems. It differs from the celestial equator because of the axial tilt of the Earth.

ecliptic coordinate system
An astronomical coordinate system commonly used to specify the apparent positions, orbits, and axial orientations of objects within the Solar System, with an origin at the geometric center of either the Sun or the Earth, a fundamental plane defined by the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun (i.e. the plane of the ecliptic), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention. This system is convenient because most of the planets and many small Solar System bodies orbit the Sun with only slight inclinations to the ecliptic. It may be implemented in either spherical or rectangular coordinates.

effective temperature
(of a star or planet) The temperature of an ideal black body that would emit the same total amount of electromagnetic radiation.

elliptical galaxy
A type of galaxy with an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless appearance. They are one of three main morphological classes of galaxy, along with spiral and lenticular galaxies.

elliptical orbit
Also elliptic orbit.
A type of Kepler orbit with an orbital eccentricity of less than 1 (often inclusive of circular orbits, which have eccentricity equal to 0), or one with negative energy. Elliptical orbits take the shape of an ellipse, and are very common in two-body astronomical systems.

elongation
The angular separation between the Sun and an orbiting body, such as a planet, as it appears from Earth.

ephemeris
A list or table of the expected positions of astronomical objects or artificial satellites in the sky at various dates and times. Modern ephemerides are often provided by computer software.

epoch
A moment in time used as a reference point for some time-varying astronomical quantity, such as the celestial coordinates or orbital elements of an astronomical object, because such quantities are subject to perturbations and change over time. The primary use of astronomical quantities specified by epochs is to calculate other relevant parameters of motion in order to predict future positions and velocities. In modern usage, astronomical quantities are often specified as a polynomial function of a particular time interval, with a given epoch as the temporal point of origin.

equator
The imaginary line on a gravitationally rounded spheroid such as a planet that represents the intersection of the spheroid's surface with a plane perpendicular to its axis of rotation and equidistant from its geographical poles. The plane of the Earth's terrestrial equator is the basis for the celestial equator.

equatorial coordinate system
An astronomical coordinate system defined by an origin at the geometric center of the Earth, a fundamental plane created by projecting the Earth's terrestrial equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention. This system is widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects as viewed from Earth. It may be implemented in either spherical or rectangular coordinates.

equinoctial
Of, relating to, or occurring at an equinox.

equinox
Either of the two precise times of year when the imaginary plane of the Earth's equator, extended indefinitely in all directions, passes through the center of the Sun (i.e. the two points at which this plane intersects the plane of the ecliptic); or, equivalently, when the Sun's apparent geocentric longitude is either 0 degrees or 180 degrees. The two equinoxes, known as the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox, occur on or near March 20 and September 22 each year. On the day of an equinox, the center of the visible Sun appears to be directly above the equator, and the durations of day and night are approximately equal all over the planet. Compare solstice.

escape velocity
The minimum speed that must be achieved for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a massive body, i.e. to achieve an infinite distance from it; more generally, escape velocity is the speed at which the sum of an object's kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy is equal to zero. It is a function of the mass of the body and of the distance between the object and the body's center of mass. An object which has achieved escape velocity is neither on the surface nor in a closed orbit of any radius.

evolutionary track
A curve on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram that a solitary star of a particular mass and composition is expected to follow during the course of its evolution. This curve predicts the combination of temperature and luminosity that a star will have during part or all of its lifetime.

extinction
The absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by matter (dust and gas) between an emitting astronomical object and the observer. Atmospheric extinction varies by the wavelength of the radiation, with the attenuation being greater for blue light than for red.

extragalactic astronomy
The branch of astronomy that studies objects and phenomena outside of the Milky Way galaxy, i.e. all objects not covered by galactic astronomy.

extrasolar object
Any astronomical object that exists outside the Solar System. The term is generally not applied to stars or any objects larger than a star or the Solar System itself, such as galaxies.

extrasolar planet
Also exoplanet.
Any planet outside the Earth's Solar System.

exobiology
See astrobiology.


== F ==

facula
A bright spot on a star's photosphere formed by concentrations of magnetic field lines. For the Sun in particular, faculae (see solar facula) are most readily observed near the solar limb. An increase in faculae as a result of a stellar cycle increases the star's total irradiance.

field galaxy
Any galaxy that does not belong to a larger cluster of galaxies and is gravitationally isolated.

field star
A randomly situated star that lies along the line of sight to a group of physically associated stars under study, such as a star cluster. These field stars are important to identify in order to prevent them from contaminating the results of a study.

first light
The first use of a newly constructed telescope or other instrument to take an astronomical image.

first magnitude star
A term used to classify the brightest stars in the night sky, with apparent magnitudes lower (i.e. brighter) than 1.50. There are 22 stars that are classified as first magnitude stars.

First Point of Aries (♈︎)
Also the Cusp of Aries.
The location of the March equinox upon the celestial sphere, used as a reference point in celestial coordinate systems. Located in the constellation Pisces, the First Point of Aries defines the ecliptic coordinate of (0°, 0°) and represents the point at which the Sun meets the celestial equator while traveling from south to north each year. It is directly opposite the First Point of Libra.

First Point of Libra
The location of the September equinox upon the celestial sphere, used as a reference point in celestial coordinate systems. Located in the constellation Virgo, the First Point of Libra represents the point at which the Sun meets the celestial equator while traveling from north to south each year. It is directly opposite the First Point of Aries.

fixed stars
Also background stars.
The ""background"" of astronomical objects in the night sky which are so distant from observers on Earth that they do not appear to move relative to each other, as opposed to the ""foreground"" of objects within the Solar System which do. The fixed stars are typically taken to include all stars other than the Sun, as well as all other extrasolar and deep-sky objects.

flare star
A class of variable star that undergoes sudden, dramatic increases in brightness due to magnetic activity on its surface. This change in brightness occurs across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays. Most flare stars are faint red dwarfs.

Fulton gap
The apparent uncommonness of planets having a size between 1.5 and 2 times that of the Earth.

Intraspecific antagonism,"Intraspecific antagonism means a disharmonious or antagonistic interaction between two individuals of the same species. As such, it could be a sociological term, but was actually coined by Alan Rayner and Norman Todd working at Exeter University in the late 1970s, to characterise a particular kind of zone line formed between wood-rotting fungal mycelia. Intraspecific antagonism is one of the expressions of a phenomenon known as vegetative or somatic incompatibility.


== Fungal individualism ==
Zone lines form in wood for many reasons, including host reactions against parasitic encroachment, and inter-specific interactions, but the lines observed by Rayner and Todd when transversely-cut sections of brown-rotted birch tree trunk or branch were incubated in plastic bags appeared to be due to a reaction between different individuals of the same species of fungus.
This was a startling inference at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy within the mycological community was that of the ""unit mycelium"". This was the theory that when two different individuals of the same species of basidiomycete wood rotting fungi grew and met within the substratum, they fused, cooperated, and shared nuclei freely. Rayner and Todd's insight was that basidiomycete fungi individuals do, in most ""adult"" or dikaryotic cases anyway, retain their individuality.
A small stable of postgraduate and postdoctoral students helped elucidate the mechanisms underlying these intermycelial interactions, at Exeter University (Todd) and the University of Bath (Rayner), over the next few years.


== Applications of intraspecific antagonism ==
 Although the attribution of individual status to the mycelia confined by intraspecific zone lines is a comparatively new idea, zone lines themselves have been known since time immemorial. The term spalting is applied by woodworkers to wood showing strongly-figured zone lines, particularly those cases where the area of ""no-man's land"" between two antagonistic conspecific mycelia is colonised by another species of fungus. Dematiaceous hyphomycetes, with their dark-coloured mycelia, produce particularly attractive black zone lines when they colonise the areas occupied by two antagonistic basidiomycete individuals. Spalted wood can be difficult to work, since different individual wood-rotting fungi have different decay efficiencies, and thus produce zones of different softness, and the zone lines themselves are usually unrotted and hard.
Instraspecific antagonism can also sometimes be of assistance in quickly recognising the membership of clones in those fungi, particularly root-rots such as Armillarea where individual mycelia may colonise large areas, or more than one tree.
It is even the subject of a recent patent.[1]

Rubens tube,"A Rubens tube, also known as a standing wave flame tube, or simply flame tube, is a physics apparatus for  demonstrating acoustic standing waves in a tube.  Invented by German physicist Heinrich Rubens in 1905, it graphically shows the relationship between sound waves and sound pressure, as a primitive oscilloscope.  Today, it is used only occasionally, typically as a demonstration in physics education.


== Overview ==
A length of pipe is perforated along the top and sealed at both ends - one seal is attached to a small speaker or frequency generator, the other to a supply of a flammable gas (propane tank). The pipe is filled with the gas, and the gas leaking from the perforations is lit. If a suitable constant frequency is used, a standing wave can form within the tube. When the speaker is turned on, the standing wave will create points with oscillating (higher and lower) pressure and points with constant pressure (pressure nodes) along the tube. Where there is oscillating pressure due to the sound waves, less gas will escape from the perforations in the tube, and the flames will be lower at those points. At the pressure nodes, the flames are higher. At the end of the tube gas molecule velocity is zero and oscillating pressure is maximal, thus low flames are observed. It is possible to determine the wavelength from the flame minimum and maximum by simply measuring with a ruler.


== Explanation ==

Since the time averaged pressure is equal at all points of the tube, it is not straightforward to explain the different flame heights. The flame height is proportional to the gas flow as shown in the figure. Based on Bernoulli's principle, the gas flow is proportional to the square root of the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the tube. This is shown in the figure for a tube without standing sound wave. Based on this argument, the flame height depends non-linearly on the local, time-dependent pressure. The time average of the flow is reduced at the points with oscillating pressure and thus flames are lower.


== History ==
Heinrich Rubens was a German physicist born in 1865. Though he worked with better remembered physicists such as Max Planck at the University of Berlin on some of the ground work for quantum physics, he is best known for his flame tube, which was demonstrated in 1905.  This original Rubens tube was a four-meter section of pipe with approximately 100 holes of 2 mm diameter spaced evenly along its length.
When the ends of the pipe are sealed and a flammable gas is pumped into the device, the escaping gas can be lit to form a row of flames of roughly equal size.  When sound is applied from one end by means of a loudspeaker, internal pressure will change along the length of the tube.  If the sound is of a frequency that produces standing waves, the wavelength will be visible in the series of flames, with the tallest flames occurring at pressure nodes, and the lowest flames occurring at pressure antinodes. The pressure antinodes correspond to the locations with the highest amount of compression and rarefaction.
The Guinness record for longest Rubens tube was achieved in 2019, when science show Kvark built a 10 meter Rubens tube at Saku Suurhall.


== Public displays ==
A Rubens tube was on display at The Exploratory in Bristol, England until it closed in 1999. A similar exhibit using polystyrene beads instead of flames featured in the At-Bristol science centre until 2009. Students make models of Rubens tube at their school science exhibition.
This display is also found in physics departments at a number of universities.
A number of physics shows also have one, such as: Rino Foundation  (The Netherlands), Fysikshow Aarhus (Denmark), Fizika Ekspres (Croatia) and ÅA Physics show (Finland).
The MythBusters also included a demonstration on their ""Voice Flame Extinguisher"" episode in 2007.  The Daily Planet's The Greatest Show Ever, ran a competition whereby five Canadian science centres competed for the best science centre's experiment/display.  Edmonton's Science Centre (Telus World of Science) utilized a Rubens tube, and won the competition.  The special was filmed on October 10, 2010.
Tim Shaw on the show Street Genius on National Geographic Channel also featured one in Episode 18 ""Wave of fire"".
The artist Emer O'Brien used Rubens tubes as the basis for the sound sculpture featured in her 2012 exhibition Return to Normal at the Wapping Project in London.


== 2D Rubens tube (pyro board) ==


=== Overview ===
A 2D Rubens tube, also known as a pyro board, is a plane of Bunsen burners that can demonstrate an acoustic standing wave in two dimensions. Similar to its predecessor, the one dimensional Rubens tube, this standing wave is caused by a multitude of factors. Pressure variation caused by the inflow of propane gas interfering with the input of sound waves into the plane causes changes in the height and color of the flames.  The 2D Rubens tube was made famous by a Danish science demonstrator group in Denmark called Fysikshow.


=== Explanation ===
A 2D Rubens tube is made up of a lot of different parts. The main part itself is the rectangular steel box that outputs the propane gas. Steel is generally used for the plane on pyro boards because the compound can generally withstand immense amounts of heat and still be able to maintain its structure. Holes are drilled on the top of the steel plane to output the propane gas that is being constantly and slowly pumped into the steel box. Instead of having a complete steel box, some pyro boards designs have wooden sides to support the steel plane on top.  In wooden-style pyro boards, the interior of the box is usually covered with some sort of heat-resistant membrane that prevents the propane inside the box from leaking.
On the sides of the steel box are speakers that input a sound into the contained medium. The rate at which the propane gas escapes through the holes on the top of the pyro board is dependent on the intensity of the inputted sound. This relationship is directly proportional, meaning as the intensity of the sound increases, the rate at which the propane gas escapes increases.
Since the medium inside the steel box is kept at a constant volume, a standing wave has the ability to be produced. The frequency at which the standing wave can be produced is largely dependent on the physical dimensions of the box and the wavelength of the wave. Since pyro boards range in sizes, each board has its own unique frequencies at which a standing wave can be produced.

Teak,"Teak (Tectona grandis) is a tropical hardwood tree species in the family Lamiaceae. It is a large, deciduous tree that occurs in mixed hardwood forests. Tectona grandis has small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters (panicles) at the end of the branches. These flowers contain both types of reproductive organs (perfect flowers). The large, papery leaves of teak trees are often hairy on the lower surface. Teak wood has a leather-like smell when it is freshly milled and is particularly valued for its durability and water resistance. The wood is used for boat building, exterior construction, veneer, furniture, carving, turnings, and various small projects.
Tectona grandis is native to south and southeast Asia, mainly Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, but is naturalised and cultivated in many countries in Africa and the Caribbean. Myanmar's teak forests account for nearly half of the world's naturally occurring teak. Molecular studies show that there are two centres of the genetic origin of teak: one in India and the other in Myanmar and Laos.


== Description ==

Teak is a large deciduous tree up to 40 m (131 ft) tall with grey to greyish-brown branches, known for its high-quality wood. Its leaves are ovate-elliptic to ovate, 15–45 cm (5.9–17.7 in) long by 8–23 cm (3.1–9.1 in) wide, and are held on robust petioles which are 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) long. Leaf margins are entire.

Fragrant white flowers are borne on 25–40 cm (10–16 in) long by 30 cm (12 in) wide panicles from June to August. The corolla tube is 2.5–3 mm long with 2 mm wide obtuse lobes. Tectona grandis sets fruit from September to December; fruits are globose and 1.2–1.8 cm in diameter. Flowers are weakly protandrous in that the anthers precede the stigma in maturity and pollen is shed within a few hours of the flower opening. The flowers are primarily entomophilous (insect-pollinated), but can occasionally be anemophilous (wind-pollinated). A 1996 study found that in its native range in Thailand, the major pollinators were species in the bee genus Ceratina.


=== Wood ===
Wood texture is hard and rings are porous. The density varies according to moisture content: at 15% moisture content it is 660 kg/m3. The heartwood is yellowish to golden-brown. Sapwood is whitish to pale yellowish brown. It can easily separate from heartwood. Teak darkens as it ages. There can be a large variation, depending on which region the teak is from. Old growth has much tighter rings than new growth. There is a leather-like scent in newly cut wood.


== Botanical history ==
Tectona grandis was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in his 1782 work Supplementum Plantarum. In 1975, Harold Norman Moldenke published new descriptions of four forms of this species in the journal Phytologia. Moldenke described each form as varying slightly from the type specimen: T. grandis f. canescens is distinguished from the type material by being densely canescent or covered in hairs, on the underside of the leaf, T. grandis f. pilosula is distinct from the type material in the varying morphology of the leaf veins, T. grandis f. punctata is only hairy on the larger veins on the underside of the leaf, and T. grandis f. tomentella is noted for its dense yellowish tomentose hairs on the lower surface of the leaf.


== Etymology ==
The English word teak comes via the Portuguese teca from Malayalam tekka (cognate with Tamil tekku, Telugu teku, and Kannada tegu) via Sanskrit ""shaka"" and ""saka"". Central Province teak and Nagpur teak are named for those regions of India.


== Distribution and habitat ==
Tectona grandis is one of three species in the genus Tectona. The other two species, T. hamiltoniana and T. philippinensis, are endemics with relatively small native distributions in Myanmar and the Philippines, respectively. Tectona grandis is native to India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and northwestern Laos.
Tectona grandis is found in a variety of habitats and climatic conditions from arid areas with only 500 mm of rain per year to very moist forests with up to 5,000 mm of rain per year. Typically, though, the annual rainfall in areas where teak grows averages 1,250–1,650 mm with a 3–5 month dry season.


== Cultivation ==

Teak's natural oils make it useful in exposed locations and make the timber termite- and pest-resistant.  Teak is durable even when not treated with oil or varnish. Timber cut from old teak trees was once believed to be more durable and harder than plantation-grown teak. Studies have shown that plantation teak performs on par with old-growth teak in erosion rate, dimensional stability, warping, and surface checking, but is more susceptible to colour change from UV exposure.
The vast majority of commercially harvested teak is grown on teak plantations found in Indonesia and controlled by Perum Perhutani (a state-owned forest enterprise) that manages the country's forests. The primary use of teak harvested in Indonesia is in the production of outdoor teak furniture for export. Nilambur in Kerala, India, is also a major producer of teak and is home to the world's oldest teak plantation.
Teak consumption raises several environmental concerns, such as the disappearance of rare old-growth teak. However, its popularity has led to growth in sustainable plantation teak production throughout the seasonally dry tropics in forestry plantations. The Forest Stewardship Council offers certification of sustainably grown and harvested teak products. Propagation of teak via tissue culture for plantation purposes is commercially viable.
Teak plantations were widely established in Equatorial Africa during the Colonial era. These timber resources, as well as the oil reserves, are at the heart of the current (2014) South Sudanese conflict.
Much of the world's teak is exported by Indonesia and Myanmar. There is also a rapidly growing plantation-grown market in Central America (Costa Rica) and South America. With a depletion of remaining natural hectares of teak forests, growth in plantations in Latin America is expected to rise.
Hyblaea puera, commonly known as the teak defoliator, is a moth native to southeast Asia. It is a teak pest whose caterpillar feeds on teak and other species of trees common in the region of Southeast Asia.


== Uses ==
Teak's high oil content, high tensile strength, and tight grain make it particularly suitable where weather resistance is desired. It is used in the manufacture of outdoor furniture and boat decks.  It is also used for cutting boards, indoor flooring, countertops, and as a veneer for indoor finishings. Although easily worked, it can cause severe blunting on edged tools because of the presence of silica in the wood.  Over time teak can weather to a silvery-grey finish, especially when exposed to sunlight.
Teak is used extensively in India to make doors and window frames, furniture, and columns, and beams in homes. It is resistant to termite attacks and damage caused by other insects. Mature teak fetches a very good price. It is grown extensively by forest departments of different states in forest areas. It was also used in the construction of the Kaaba in the Masjid al-Haram of Mecca, which is the holiest structure in the Islamic faith.
Leaves of the teak wood tree are used in making Pellakai gatti (jackfruit dumpling), where batter is poured into a teak leaf and steamed. This type of usage is found in the coastal district of Udupi in the Tulunadu region in South India. The leaves are also used in gudeg, a dish of young jackfruit made in Central Java, Indonesia, and give the dish its dark brown colour.
Teak is used as a food plant by the larvae of moths of the genus Endoclita including E. aroura, E. chalybeatus, E. damor, E. gmelina, E. malabaricus, E. sericeus and E. signifer other Lepidoptera including the turnip moth.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Boatbuilding ===

Teak has been used as a boatbuilding material for over 2000 years (it was found in an archaeological dig in Berenice Panchrysos, a port on the Indian Roman trade route). In addition to relatively high strength, teak is also highly resistant to rot, fungi, and mildew. The wood has a relatively low shrinkage ratio, which makes it excellent for applications where it undergoes periodic changes in moisture. Teak has the unusual property of being both an excellent structural timber for framing or planking, while at the same time being easily worked and finished, unlike some otherwise similar woods such as purpleheart. For this reason, it is also prized for the trim work on boat interiors. Due to the oily nature of the wood, care must be taken to properly prepare the wood before gluing.
When used on boats, teak is also very flexible in the finishes that may be applied. One option is to use no finish at all, in which case the wood will naturally weather to a pleasing silver grey. The wood may also be oiled with a finishing agent such as linseed or tung oil. This results in a pleasant, somewhat dull finish. Finally, teak may also be varnished for a deep, lustrous glow.
Teak is also used extensively in boat decks, as it is extremely durable but requires regular maintenance.  The teak tends to wear into the softer 'summer' growth bands first, forming a natural 'non-slip' surface. Any sanding is therefore only damaging. The use of modern cleaning compounds, oils or preservatives will shorten the life of the teak, as it contains natural teak oil a very small distance below the white surface. Wooden boat experts will only wash the teak with salt water, and re-caulk when needed. This cleans the deck and prevents it from drying out and the wood shrinking. The salt helps it absorb and retain moisture and prevents any mildew and algal growth. Over-maintenance, such as cleaning teak with harsh chemicals, can shorten its usable lifespan as decking.


== Propagation ==

Teak is propagated mainly from seeds. Germination of the seeds involves pretreatment to remove dormancy arising from the thick pericarp. Pretreatment involves alternate wetting and drying of the seed. The seeds are soaked in water for 12 hours and then spread to dry in the sun for 12 hours. This is repeated for 10–14 days and then the seeds are sown in shallow germination beds of coarse peat covered by sand. The seeds then germinate after 15 to 30 days.
Clonal propagation of teak has been successfully done through grafting, rooted stem cuttings, and micropropagation. While bud grafting onto seedling root stock has been the method used for establishing clonal seed orchards that enables assemblage of clones of the superior trees to encourage crossing, rooted stem cuttings and micro propagated plants are being increasingly used around the world for raising clonal plantations.


== Illegal logging ==

Illegal logging is prevalent in countries with natural teak forests, including India and Burma.
Since 1989, the state-owned Myanma Timber Enterprise has run the country's logging industry. In 2014, Myanmar's government imposed a strict ban on exporting wild-grown teak logs. In 2015, 153 Chinese loggers were sentenced to life in prison for illegal logging. Illegal teak logging persists, especially in contested areas. While it is illegal for timber to be exported via land borders, 95% of Myanmar's teak enters China through the China–Myanmar border.
Since the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, illegal logging of teak and tamalan trees has surged in Sagaing Region, predominantly in key contested battlegrounds, including Kani, Yinmabin, Kantbalu, Indaw, and Banmauk townships. Both the Burmese military and resistance groups have profited from the illegal logging trade. Smugglers transport the wood to India to circumvent economic sanctions and use the Myanma Timber Enterprise to license the wood as being sourced from permitted areas.
EU regulation
The regulation that addresses the import of timber, including teak, into the EU from unknown or illegal sources is the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) No. 995/2010. This regulation aims to prevent the trade of illegally harvested timber and timber products within the EU market. It places an obligation on operators who place timber and timber products on the EU market to ensure they are legally harvested.
This regulation specifically applies to teak and other high-risk timber species, particularly those sourced from countries with poor forest governance or illegal logging activities. Myanmar, for example, has been a focus due to concerns over illegal teak harvesting from there.
For more detailed information, you can refer to the full text of the regulation here.


== World's largest living teak tree ==
Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (Myanmar) found the world's two biggest living teak trees on 28 August 2017 in Homalin Township, Sagaing Region, Myanmar. The biggest one, named Homemalynn 1, is 8.4 m (28 ft) in diameter and 34 m (112 ft) tall. The second biggest one, named Homemalynn 2, is 8.2 m (27 ft) in diameter.
Previously, the world's biggest recorded teak tree was located within the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary in the Palakkad District of Kerala in India, named Kannimara. The tree is approximately 47.5 metres (156 ft) tall. Its age is between 450 and 500 years and is considered one of the oldest teak trees in the world.
In 2017, a tree was discovered in the Ottakallan area of the Thundathil range of the Malayattoor Forest Division in Kerala with a girth of 7.65 metres (25.1 ft) and a height of 40 metres (130 ft). A teak tree in Kappayam, Edamalayar, Kerala, which used to be considered the biggest, has a girth of 7.23 metres.
Tree No. 23 is the oldest planted teak on earth. It is located in Conolly's plot (the world's oldest teak plantation), Nilambur, Kerala.

Model (person),"A model is a person who has the job of using their body to pose for art, or to show fashion items, such as clothes or jewellery. Models often appear in advertising on television and in print media, for example newspapers and magazines, or on the web.


== First model ==
The first person described to work as a fashion model was Parisian shopgirl, Marie Vernet Worth. She was a 'house' model in 1852, for her fashion designer husband at the haute couture House of Worth.


== Commercial models ==
There are many different types of models. Some models only use certain parts of their bodies. For example, a hand model is a person who only uses their hands. A hand model would be used to display certain items, for example rings and watches. These models are mostly used for advertisements.
Fashion models are used to sell clothing or cosmetics. People who make clothing will often use fashion models to wear the clothing they make at fashion shows. The models will walk up and down a raised section of floor called the catwalk or runway to show the clothing to other people. Some exclusive 'fashion houses' also use models to show off their dresses to clients. This idea was invented by Charles Worth.
Photographers use models for advertising and for portfolio work. Work can involve news, fine art, fashion, fitness and glamour. Some photographers may ask models to express different moods or feeling for pictures.
Models can be all shapes and sizes, both men and women. Models do not have to be size zero, though most are young, good-looking females. There are specialist models for feet, hands and face, all of which may be photographed for various reasons. Some models are plus-size models and are of a larger build.


=== Supermodels ===
A supermodel is a highly paid model who usually has a worldwide reputation. The term supermodel began being used in the 1980s. Supermodels usually work for top fashion designers and famous clothing brands. They have multimillion-dollar contracts. They also have endorsements and campaigns. They have branded themselves as household names and are recognized worldwide.


== Art models ==
Fine art models are hired by photographers, painters, sculptors and other artists to pose for their art.
Models are frequently used during art classes, but are also employed by professional artists. The most common types of art created using models are figure drawing and painting, sculpture and photography. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in advertising, its 'artwork' commonly employs models.
Throughout the history of Western art, drawing the human figure from life was considered the best way to develop the skill of drawing. In the art school classroom setting, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, animals etc., against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.
Models for life drawing classes are often nude, apart from visually non-obstructive personal items such as small jewellery and sometimes eyeglasses. This may be referred to as being 'undraped' or 'disrobed'.


== Employment ==
Models typically work in one of two ways:

Agency. Models are given work by an agency: the agency takes a percentage of the fee.
Self-employed. Models are contacted directly by advertising agencies, photographers and others. The models set their own fee.

Tulipwood,"Most commonly, tulipwood is the greenish yellowish wood yielded from the tulip tree, found on the Eastern side of North America and a similar species is found in some parts of China. In the United States, it is commonly known as tulip poplar or yellow poplar, even though the tree is not related to the poplars. It is notable for its height, which can exceed 190 feet. The wood is very light, around 490 kg per cubic meter, but very strong and is used in many applications, including furniture, joinery and moldings. It can also be stained very easily and is often used as a low-cost alternative to walnut and cherry in furniture and doors.


== Other types ==


=== Brazilian ===
Brazilian tulipwood is a different species. A classic high-quality wood, it is very dense with a lovely figure. It is used for inlays in furniture and for small turned items. Available only in small sizes, it is rarely used in the solid for luxury furniture. Like other woods with a pronounced figure it is rather strongly subject to fashion.
In the nineteenth century Brazilian tulipwood was thought to be the product of the brazilian rosewood Physocalymma scaberrimum (West Indian tulipwood), but in the twentieth century it became clear it was yielded by a species of Dalbergia. At some point it was misidentified as Dalbergia frutescens, a misidentification which can still be found in books aimed at the woodworker. For some decades it has been known to be yielded by Dalbergia decipularis, a species restricted to a small area in Western-Brazil. But both Dalbergia fructescens and Dalbergia decipularis are named (Brazilian tulipwood). Also Dalbergia cearensis kingwood or violetwood, is named tulipwood and Dalbergia oliveri the burmese rosewood is sometimes called ""burma tulipwood"".


=== American tulipwood ===
The cheap, soft and pale wood from the tuliptree Liriodendron tulipifera is known as American tulipwood or poplar and American whitewood,  canary whitewood and canary wood, it is widely used.


=== Australian ===
There also exists the ""australian tulipwood"", ""tulipwood trees"" the common name of Harpullia,  Harpullia pendula (Black or Queensland, Moreton Bay tulipwood) and Harpullia arborea (Cooktown tulipwood) or Harpullia hillii (Blunt leaf tulipwood) and Harpullia alata (Wing-leaved tulipwood) etc. Certain varieties of Harpullia were prized for their dark coloured timber. The one most commonly known to horticulture is Harpullia pendula which is widely planted as a street tree along the east coast of Australia. Also Drypetes acuminata and Drypetes deplanchei (Yellow tulipwood) and New England tulipwood Guilfoylia monostylis are from Australia.


=== Others ===
Also exists the tuliptrees, Thespesia populnea and Thespesia acutiloba, Spathodea campanulata, Stenocarpus sinuatus, and Licaria guianensis, Dicypellium caryophyllatum and Hibiscus elatus, these trees resp. their wood is also occasionally named tulipwood.

Cyclonic separation,"Cyclonic separation is a process to take out all of the unwanted particles from air, gas, or steam. The process uses a process called vortex separation and does not use filtering. It uses rotational and gravitational force to separate the unwanted particles. The process is done in a device called cyclone separator or ""cyclone"". The word ""cyclone"" in meteorology (weather) is a force in which the air's movement spirals inward.

Google Maps Navigation,"Google Maps Navigation is a mobile application developed by Google for the Android and iOS operating systems that was later integrated into the Google Maps mobile app. The application uses an Internet connection to a GPS navigation system to provide turn-by-turn voice-guided instructions on how to arrive at a given destination.
The application requires connection to Internet data (e.g. 3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi, etc.) and normally uses a GPS satellite connection to determine its location. A user can enter a destination into the application, which will plot a path to it. The app displays the user's progress along the route and issues instructions for each turn.


== History ==
The application’s beta release was released on October 28, 2009, accompanying the release of Android 2.0 (Eclair) on the Motorola Milestone (known as the Motorola Droid). Google Maps Navigation Beta was initially released in the United States. The application (version 4.2) was later released in the UK on April 20, 2010 and Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland on June 9, 2010.

Planet Patrol (project),"Planet Patrol is a NASA citizen science project available in Zooniverse and aimed at discovering new exoplanets with data from the TESS telescope.
The project is built on results produced by a computer algorithm. The algorithm measures the center-of-light of the images and automatically compares it to the catalog position of the corresponding star.
The main difference with Planet Hunters is that Planet Patrol looks at objects that represent a detected planet candidate in TESS data, whereas Planet Hunters searches through all the stars in the TESS databases and asks humans to find such candidates.
As of September 2020, there are 1370 volunteers and 72,938 classifications have been done.
The images representing a possible exoplanet transit show a single bright source near the middle of the image with a dot at the center.


== Results ==
Two papers were published by Planet Patrol, vetting 1998 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). Of these TOIs 1461 passed as planet candidates, 286 were ruled out as false-positive and 251 were labelled as potential false-positive. The resulting catalog is named TESS Triple 9 (TT9), named after the number of vetted TOIs in each paper being 999.
The second TT9 paper describes interesting planet candidates, such as TIC 396720998.01 (TOI 709.01), a sub-Jovian around a hot subdwarf, named LB 1721. The planet candidate produces a V-shaped transit, which is different from the U-shaped transits that most planets produce. TOI 709.01 was previously classified as a false-positive by TRICERATOPS, another vetting tool. Because this tool uses pre-existing knowledge of its host star and transit shape, this tool might have been confused by the small size of the host star and the resulting V-shape of a transit. TOI 709.01 would be the second transiting planet around a degenerate star if confirmed. The first transiting planet around a white dwarf was WD 1856+534 b.
The paper also describes two planet candidates in the habitable zone: TOI 715.01 and the already confirmed TOI 1227 b.

Fire glass,"Fire glass (also fire pit glass, fire rocks, fire beads or lava glass) is a type of tempered glass, chunks of which are used decoratively on fireplaces. Pieces of the glass are heaped around jets of burning gas, or around liquid ethanol, in order to conceal the jets and reflect the flames. It is an alternative to ceramic and stone decorative elements, such as ceramic logs and pumice (""lava rock"").


== Manufacturing processes ==
Fire glass is sold in a wide range of colors. It may be made in different shapes, such as beads, diamonds, cubes or rounded pebbles. The sizes range from approximately 1⁄4 to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm), and is made in various different colors, sometimes with reflective coatings.
The first fire glass to be sold in the U.S. market, around 2006, was shattered in form. This is the most popular fire glass and is typically reflective glass on one side and colored on the other. The reflective coating gives a shimmering effect when in use. The shattered or broken tempered glass is the most popular form of fire glass used by consumers.
Broken standard sheets of tempered glass are typically sifted to remove any sandy, small, or very sharp pieces of glass, while the rest may optionally be lightly tumbled to remove the sharp edges. Local outdoor living companies or online retailers will often obtain broken tempered glass from local glass companies, then shatter, sift, clean and package the glass to sell to consumers. U.S. companies will also import fire glass from China by the container, as it is not made in the U.S. in bulk.


== Usage ==
The glass itself is unchanged by the fire, but accumulates dust and black soot produced by the burning hydrocarbons. Being glass, it can be cleaned with vinegar and water. Lighting the flames while there is any water on the glass can lead to uneven heating and cause the fire glass to shatter explosively. Gloves should be worn when handling glass, and any broken pieces sifted out and recycled.
One unique property of using fire glass in a fireplace compared to using ceramic logs or other materials is that it can provide a wide range of color options available. Fire Glass also has various sizes for use  in the fireplace. This has become a popular choice for fire places and fire pits as well as other home improvement projects.

Cradling (paintings),"Cradling is a process used in the restoration and preservation of paintings on wooden panel. It consists in mounting a grid of wooden slats to the back of a painting to create a reinforcement and preserve the flat paint surface.
Slats in either the horizontal or vertical direction are permanently fixed to the back of the panel, whilst the secondary perpendicular slats remain loose, held solely in place by the upper row. This allows for a degree of movement in the panel, which may warp, subject to changing levels of dampness and atmospheric pressure.
This procedure can often be found on Old Master paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries, when painting on wood and particularly oak panel was widely practiced.
There are numerous reasons for choosing to cradle a panel. This can be done to piece back together a painting which has split and cracked over time. It can also be done to consolidate, preserve or straighten back a panel which may have warped.
There are detrimental factors to consider before cradling a painting. It is an interventive procedure which may involve sanding the back of the panel in order to create a flat surface to affix the cradling. It is a non reversible procedure which alters the condition and state of a work of art, which triggers ethical issues.
With many cradled paintings the sliding cradle members will get stuck due to the movement of the panel. This leads to much tension and cracks in the panel and permanent deformation. Applying a cradle to the back of a panel painting almost always leads to more severe structural problems depending on the climate in which the painting is kept and the way the planks of the panel were saw. Nowadays, in the modern world of conservation cradling a painting has been outdated and subject to criticism.
Duke University and The University of Brussels have developed an art conservation tool that uses X-rays and algorithms to analyze the paintings. To better image the art piece, for it is of wood sections (cradles) the machine called Platypus or the computer math program sorts out the wood and finely visualizes the original art.

Pyre,"A pyre, also known as a funeral pyre, is a structure used for burning a body. The word pyre comes from the Greek word for fire. Pyres are built outdoors. They are usually made from wood. The body is placed on top of the pyre or under it. Then the pyre is set on fire. Pyres are still used for funerals in some parts of the world. They are also used for other types of ceremonies. In those ceremonies, there is a big fire, but a body is not burned. Historically, pyres have also been used to kill people by burning them alive.


== Pyres used for funerals ==
The Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist religions still use pyres for the cremation of dead people. This form of funeral is thousands of years old. However, it is no longer legal in many countries. The ancient Greeks and ancient Romans used funeral pyres. The Vikings also used them. Viking funeral pyres were usually built on boats floating in the sea.


== Other uses for pyres ==
People sometimes use pyres to make a big fire or bonfire but they do not burn a real body. These types of pyres are used for celebrations or to remember a person or a special event. Pyres are often used in Guy Fawkes Night celebrations in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries. In Denmark and Germany people light pyres to celebrate the summer solstice (the longest day of the year). People light pyres in Switzerland to celebrate their National Day.
Farmers sometimes use pyres to destroy the bodies of dead animals. They especially use them when the animals have died of a disease. This helps prevent the spread of the disease to other animals.
In the past, pyres were sometimes used to execute people. The people were burned while they were still alive. Often the person was tied to a stake (a very big stick) on top of the pyre. This type of execution was known as ""burning at the stake"". Joan of Arc died in this way.

Combine painting,"A combine painting or Combine is an artwork that incorporates elements of both painting and sculpture. Items attached to paintings might include three-dimensional everyday objects such as clothing or furniture, as well as printed matter including photographs or newspaper clippings. 
The term is most closely associated with the artwork of American artist Robert Rauschenberg (1925–2008) who coined the phrase Combine to describe his own artworks that explore the  boundary between art and the everyday world. By placing them in the context of art, he endowed a new significance to ordinary objects. These cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of medium specificity mentioned by modernist art critic Clement Greenberg. 
American artist Frank Stella created a large body of paintings in the late 1950s that recall the Combines of Robert Rauschenberg. In these works, Stella juxtaposed a wide variety of surfaces and materials, a process which led to Stella's later sculpture of the 21st century.


== Rauschenberg's Combines ==
The reception of Rauschenberg’s Combines has been varied throughout their history. Paul Schimmel of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art described Rauschenberg's Combine paintings as ""some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."" They have also been called ""ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage"" by The Guardian's critic Adrian Searle.
In reviews of the 2019 Whitney Biennial, critics highlighted Robert Rauschenberg as precedent for many of the contemporary artworks included. Artist Xaviera Simmons, however, pointed out that these critics did not go far enough to look into Rauschenberg's own precedents; she pointed to African American artists working with found objects in the Southern United States — a likely example for Rauschenberg who was raised in Port Arthur, Texas. In The Art Newspaper, Simmons wrote, “To mention the overarching theme of this iteration of the Whitney Biennial as linked to Robert Rauschenberg’s legacy, for example, without breaking down his connection as a Texan and his probable viewing of the assemblages he must have seen by Black American artists—descendants of slavery—in the rural South is actually preposterous. It does us all an educational disservice and disconnects a lineage and an impetus that is home-grown American. The wonder of Rauschenberg more than likely would not exist without the trauma of the American, disenfranchised rural landscape.”

In his own work, the artist Jasper Johns used similar techniques as those seen in Rauschenberg’s Combines. For example, in a painting, titled Fool’s House (1964), Johns affixed a broom onto his canvas. This possible inspiration from Rauschenberg was likely due to the close artistic and romantic relationship between the two artists. They met for the first time in 1953. Early on, to support their artistic careers, they collaborated on commercial projects, such as window displays for upscale retailers including Tiffany's and Bonwit Teller in Manhattan. As they both progressed in their artistic practices, they had studios in the same building and shared ideas about art and life on a daily basis from 1954 to 1961.
Examples of Rauschenberg's Combine paintings include Bed (1955), Canyon (1959), and the free-standing Monogram (1955–1959).  Critic John Perreault wrote ""The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."" Perreault praised the works for being memorable, photogenic, and able to ""stick in the mind"" as well as ""surprise and keep on surprising."" 
Rauschenberg went as far as to incorporate taxidermied animals, including birds, onto some of his Combines. For example, his 1955 work Satellite features a stuffed pheasant ""patrolling its top edge."" Additionally, his work Canyon (1959) includes a golden eagle affixed to its front. In another work, Odalisk (1955/1958), Rauschenberg included a stuffed rooster.
His Combine Broadcast, which features three concealed radios behind the painting, was called a ""melange of paint, grids, newspaper clips and fabric snippets"" by Grace Glueck of the New York Times. 
The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's Combine paintings, according to Edmund Burke Feldman, is ""nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."" In this regard the Combine paintings relate to the succeeding Pop art and the much earlier predecessor: the Dada Movement of the early 1900s. Rauschenberg himself said ""I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a collaboration with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control.""
Moira Roth links the Combines to Marcel Duchamp's attitude in art, saying that the perceived density of the content, and the integration of mass media elements is a facade born out of the alienation and indifference experienced by the artist during the McCarthy Period. Jonathan Katz says that underneath the impersonal and inexpressive appearance of Rauschenberg’s art is a hidden homosexual code that can unlock some of the significance of the work.


== Exponential increase in value ==
In the early 1960s, Rauschenberg's Combines sold from $400 to $7,500. In 1999, the Museum of Modern Art, which had balked at buying Rauschenberg's work decades earlier, spent $12 million to buy his Factum II, made in 1957. Rauschenberg's Rebus was valued in 1991 at $7.3 million. This three-panel work created in 1955 that takes its name from the Latin for a ""puzzle of images and words"", it ""builds a narrative from seemingly nonsensical sequences of found images and abstract elements,"" according to The New York Times. MoMA bought Rebus in 2005. In 2008, The New York Times' art critic Roberta Smith, who described Combines as ""multimedia hybrids"", wrote that MoMA was ""Rauschenberg Central"" because they own around 330 of his works, more than the Whitney Museum of American Art who now owns only 81. In 2012, Canyon was donated to MoMA by the children of Ileana Sonnabend as part of an IRS settlement that valued the work at $65 million. The highest recorded selling price for a Combine was for Johanson’s Painting (1961) which sold for $18 million in 2015.


== Canyon (1959) ==

Canyon, one of Rauschenberg's best known Combines, has been the subject of art-historical debate revolving around the validity of reading Rauschenberg's work iconographically. The historian Kenneth Bendiner famously proposed Canyon as a playful recreation of a 1635 Rembrandt painting depicting a scene from Greek mythology, The Rape of Ganymede. He interpreted the suspended pillow in the Combine as Ganymede's buttocks and the stuffed golden eagle as the form assumed by Ganymede’s abductor, the Greek god Zeus. Other art historians, such as  Branden Joseph, have argued that searching for iconography in Rauschenberg's Combines is useless because it can be made to exist anywhere. 
More recent interpretations of Canyon reconsider the work in postmodern terms. The art historian Yve-Alain Bois points out that Rauschenberg's art's ""lack of center"" is a statement in itself, and the infinite permutations of meaning that can result highlight the subjectivity of art reception that postmodernism explores. Bois also considers the search for iconographic meaning in Rauschenberg's work misguided because it is too limiting.

OEM,"OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturing. It is mainly used to describe parts for cars, airplanes and electrical systems. It is also used for computer parts and computer programs.
The name OEM is usually used when a new version of something is made by a company that is different to the company that first made it. The new company will sell the product at a cheaper price, but this is often because it does not have as many features as the first version. For example, an OEM computer program will usually only come with the disc and a licence, but no instruction manuals.",0
Diving destination,"Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism.
Motivations to travel for scuba diving are complex and may vary considerably during the diver's development and experience. Participation can vary from once off to multiple dedicated trips per year over several decades. The popular destinations fall into several groups, including tropical reefs, shipwrecks and cave systems, each frequented by its own group of enthusiasts, with some overlap. Temperate and inland open water reef sites are generally dived by people who live relatively nearby.
The industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, safety and convenience by way of dive charter services and guide services on dives. Customer satisfaction is largely dependent on the quality of services provided, and personal communication has a strong influence on the popularity of specific service providers in a region.
Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers. Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs so that the industry can continue to develop sustainably.
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity, requiring significant capital outlay to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large capital expense, with high running costs. There are also health and safety aspects for the operator and the customer. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money. Economic sustainability is affected by environmental awareness and conservation, service delivery and customer satisfaction, and sustainable business management. Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, declarations of medical fitness to dive, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.


== History ==

The history of scuba diving tourism is linked to the history of scuba equipment development and availability, and to the development of training systems that opened up the activity to sufficient numbers to support the industry. Key equipment developments include swimfins, which give the diver underwater mobility and free the hands for other functions, the diving mask, which provides underwater vision, the open circuit regulator, a simple and reliable breathing gas source, the buoyancy compensator, which allows the diver to swim comfortably above the bottom, and float at the surface, wetsuit, a simple and easy to use protection from moderately cold water, submersible pressure gauge, allowing easy monitoring of remaining breathing gas, dive computers,  and nitrox breathing gas, both of which allowed longer dives without decompression.
The growth of the diving industry in a region tends to follow a logistic curve, with a slow start and mostly established, experienced divers with relatively high skill levels exploring a new area where there is little supporting infrastructure. As the area becomes popular, the infrastructure develops and the growth accelerates until it is limited by carrying capacity is approached. By this time the main diver demography has shifted towards the inexperienced and often uncertified diver, with low skill levels and a greater tendency to damage the environment  due to ignorance and lack of basic diving skills. Beyond this stage the situation may stabilise if managed well, or if not, the deterioration in value to the tourist may cause a reduction in popularity and a loss of trade.
Too much competition for customers amongst a large number of diving service providers in a region can lead to low profit margins and pressure on struggling companies to cut costs by following unsustainable diving practices and providing substandard equipment. A reduction in numbers may lead to more cooperation between the remaining companies, and a greater willingness to follow sustainable practices.
The shape of the curve will vary depending on the region.  Areas with more resilient ecologies may see larger numbers while remaining viable, while areas with sensitive ecologies may suffer early collapse. Climate change is likely to render many areas more sensitive to diver impact and most will probably have a reduction in carrying capacity based on limits of acceptable change. The sites that remain viable for longer may receive the overflow from sites which suffer ecological collapse, putting them under greater stress as the less competent divers flood areas that were previously less attractive to them.


== Motivation ==

The motivations of scuba divers to travel have been attributed to adventure, learning, escape, social interaction, stature, challenge and excitement, and while these are probably valid for most novice divers and some long term divers, the motivation of long term enthusiasts may be more complex. The development of a recreational diver from novice to experienced diver is usually associated with acquisition and improvement of skills, and is often accompanied by a shift in motivations to dive. Similarly, expectations of the diving experience, satisfaction with the experience available at different dive sites, and attitudes towards the underwater environment will change in divers who continue to dive over the longer term and relatively frequently. The desire to improve and learn for personal growth and the long term satisfaction and fulfilment derived from this learning is common in such divers. This could be an important factor informing the planning and management of diving tourism.


== Destinations ==

Three main classes of recreational diving tourism destinations exist. These are tropical reefs, shipwrecks, and cave systems. Each caters to a different clientele, though there is some overlap. Temperate reefs are less popular as tourist attractions, but can have their own enthusiasts, including short range tourism and incidental dive tourism associated with general tourism in the region. Any exceptional dive site may be visited by expeditionary dive tourists once the attractions are known, though these destinations are generally not serviced by mainstream tourism service providers.


=== Regions where recreational diving is a major tourist industry ===
There are a few regions where international diver tourism is a significant part of the economy They are mostly tropical areas with extensive coral reefs and predictable weather and water conditions, and often have relatively undeveloped industrial economies.

Great Barrier Reef of Australia
The Red Sea
Hurghada is one of the diving destinations on the Red Sea with rich marine biodiversity, good visibility, a variety of dive sites suitable for different skill levels, including historic shipwrecks, and is accessible at all times of the year.
The Caribbean Sea
Indonesia
Thailand
The Coral Triangle of southeast Asia:
The Philippines
Malaysia
Other regions are also popular for diving, but the relative importance of scuba tourism is lower. There are a very large number of dive sites in Europe, and also in parts of the US, reflecting the origins of the activity and a large fraction of the tourists.


=== Tropical coral reefs ===

Tropical coral reefs are popular recreational diving tourism destinations, as they are generally both pleasant and colorful to dive, relatively low in serious hazards, and the water is at a comfortable temperature, so they attract divers of all levels of competence. They are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact.
Regions include:


=== Shipwrecks ===

Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.
Wreck diving may be divided into three categories of differing hazard and skill and certification requirement:

Non-penetration diving (i.e. swimming over the wreck)
Limited penetration diving, within the ""light zone""
Full penetration diving, beyond the ""light zone""
The inherent hazards of wreck diving may be aggravated by local circumstances like depth, layout and condition of the wreck, the silting hazard, and general sea conditions such as visibility, illumination, surge and currents, and water temperature. Training for wreck diving may be marketed as an associated service.


=== Flooded cave systems ===

Cave diving is diving in water-filled caves, which is considered an extreme sport. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, but almost all cave diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave diving and cavern diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified. Cave diving is a specialist aspect of scuba tourism, as the risks are relatively high and the skill requirements are stringent. Cave diving tourism is generally serviced by specialist dive guides and instructors.
Regions include:

The cenotes of the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico.


== Dive resorts ==
A dive resort is a recreational diving service provider which also provides accommodation for clients and their families. They are usually established in places where recreational diving tourism is popular for a large part of the year, particularly if it is a significant part of the local economy.
Dive resorts usually start out small, catering for dive group of about ten divers booked by a single dive shop or agent from a remote area, so the group is often divers who are a social group at their place of origin. This allows the resort to accommodate the needs of that particular group. If the resort becomes popular, it will usually expand and may become the nucleus for development of the area as other service industries form around it.


== Services provided ==
The scuba diving tourism industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, dive charter services and guide services on dives. These organisations are called recreational diving service providers, or dive centres. The standard EN 14467 / ISO 24803 specifies performance requirements for the service provider, and covers aspects of diver training and education, guided dives, and equipment rental, but not the supply of breathing gases, as this is usually covered by national legislation. All of these services are considered distinct.


=== Experiences ===
Retail dive centres provide dive charters, which may be shore or boat dived, dive guides and information on the local environment and ecology, and transportation to and from the dive sites, and may also provide accommodation and hospitality services to tourists, or act as their agents for these services.


==== Liveaboards and day boat dives ====

A liveaboard dive boat is a mobile dive resort. The divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat and provide catering and other hotel services. Amenities may vary from basic to luxurious and the cost will be in proportion. In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber.
The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical diver lift platform. Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat.The tender may also be used to fetch divers separated from the main boat, and for shore excursions where there are no docking facilities.
day boat and basic boat dives may be provided through a land based dive resort, a dive shop, or booked directly with the boar operator. Facilities range from catered with multiple dives to basic transport to and from the site. Much depends on the distance to the site and expected sea and weather conditions.
A day boat would generally provide shelter from the weather and spray while in transit, and be used to transport divers to more than one dive-site during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them. Smaller boats are more usually used when the distance to the dive site is short, and only one dive is intended. Facilities are likely to provide sitting space and a place to sore the scuba set and basic gear. It is common for the diver to travel wearing the diving suit. Since the boat needs only a small amount of space for each diver, it can be smaller and faster than larger boats, or be optimised for surf or slipway launches where there are no convenient harbours. Protection from the weather on fast boats is likely to be the diving suit, sometimes with a windbreaker worn over it, and a hat for the sun, but this will depend on weather conditions.


=== Safety ===

Historically, scuba diving was considered a relatively high risk activity, but this perception has been modified by the developments in equipment, training and service provision. Medical support services and local availability of decompression chambers and on-board medical oxygen for first aid has increased, improving the management of diving accidents and reducing the risk of permanent injury. Recompression facilities for treating serious diving injuries are not often available, even in first world countries.
Prudent service providers will check a client's certification cards and log to ensure the diver has been assessed as competent to dive sites similar to those booked, and may require the diver to demonstrate relevant skills in a checkout dive. Where skills are not of a standard required for safe diving, or environmentally responsible diving, the diver may be requested to take part in remedial training.


=== Equipment ===

The dive tourism industry tends to provide rental equipment to travelling divers more than equipment sales and service, but those aspects are considered valuable adjuncts. Scuba equipment is relatively heavy, and some components (scuba cylinders and diving weights) are not economically transportable by air, and may be included in the cost of a dive. Regulators, wet-suits, masks and fins are more personal equipment, and may be brought by the diver or rented, so a fairly large stock and where applicable, range of sizes is necessary to be able to rent equipment to all customers at a given time. Cameras and dive computers are usually owned by the diver, though entry-level examples may be available for hire at some dive centres. Some equipment manufacturers and distributors encourage exclusive provision of their products through financial incentives, and the range of spares and tools for servicing is affected by the range of equipment stocked, so the range of equipment available may be limited.


=== Diver training ===

There is a large market for diver training while on vacation. Most parts of the world do not have desirable local recreational dive sites, and many divers choose to combine training with a vacation to an area of popular dive sites. Sites suitable for entry-level training often differ considerably from sites which feature as highly desirable for scenic dives and high biodiversity, and unskilled beginners are necessarily kept away from deeper sites with more challenging conditions for their own safety and the protection of the often fragile ecosystems. Specialist wreck diving, cave diving and low environmental impact diving courses are usually available where the local sites are associated with requirements for these certifications.
The Universal Referral Program (URP) is a system intended to facilitate completion of training for open water recreational scuba diving students who intend to do their training dives at a place different from the venue for the theory and confined water training. More specifically, it allows inter agency referral - the referral instructor is not necessarily a member of the same certification agency as the initiating instructor.
Refresher training


=== Specialisation training ===
Training in several specialisations, particularly in technical diving, has become popular as tourism adjuncts because of the venue requiring a specific skill set for access to the sites.

Cave diving
Sidemount diving
Rebreather diving
Deep wreck and wreck penetration diving
Other specialisation training is more optional, as the specific certification is not strictly required, such as boat diving, night diving or drift diving, which are specialties with certification in some agencies' training options, but considered an integral part of core skill certification by others.


== Environmental impact ==

During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Since the 1970s diving has changed from an elite activity to a more accessible recreation, marketed to a very wide demographic. To some extent better equipment has been substituted for more rigorous training, and the reduction in perceived risk has shortened minimum training requirements by several training agencies. Training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences.
Scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide, which has increased to about 23 million by 2016 at about one million per year. Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers.
Diver impact on subtropical, and particularly temperate reefs is less researched than tropical reefs. The perception is that these reefs are less vulnerable than tropical reefs and the sessile species are less vulnerable to diver impact. Diver contact with the bottom is also prevalent on temperate reefs – one of the main forms mentioned is fin contact with the bottom sediment, raising particulate material into the water column and degrading visibility.
Three aspects of responsible diving behaviour have been identified:

Safe diving behaviour, which is largely a matter of competence, use of appropriate equipment for the dive, use of equipment in good working order, staying within the bounds of personal competence and adherence to procedures known to reduce risk.
Good buoyancy control and trim, the ability to remain at a controlled distance from the benthos, and to do so without contacting it. This is a skill often neglected in entry level recreational diver training, but often offered as an extra course, (eg: PADI Peak performance buoyancy), in training systems that have been planned around minimising the duration of individual courses, and where the entry-level training concentrates on providing the minimum skills acceptable for the safety of the diver in the conditions where the training is done. This has convenience advantages to the diver, and financial advantages to the training provider, but as most recreational divers never progress in training beyond entry level, they are often left marginally competent, and may not get enough practice to improve.
Non-contact behaviour, the voluntary avoidance of contact which may damage the environment. This behaviour is only effective if good buoyancy control and trim are available, and it requires situational awareness which may not be sufficiently developed in a novice, particularly in an unfamiliar environment, and using unfamiliar equipment, often exacerbated by the use of a camera, which can distract the diver from detail awareness of their surroundings.
The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types:

The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites,
Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, causing direct physical damage
Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage, which can dislodge loose deposits and accelerate corrosion
Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.


=== Strategies for sustainable use management ===

Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs

Carrying capacity approach. where the number of divers is restricted. This also limits tourism income from the region. Sustainable diver carrying capacity is influenced by factors which vary between sites.
Limits of acceptable change. This model uses quantitative limits on change defined in specific management objectives for a site using an established baseline.
Percentile approach, where capacity is limited by comparison with damage at non-dived control sites
Restricting recreational divers to delimited locations, which usually concentrates divers and damage along diving trails. This creates paths of degraded reef through the more pristine areas, and will cause dissatisfaction as the trail degrades further.
Regulating the type of diving equipment allowed, generally accessories which are thought to increase reef contacts, such as gloves and cameras. These restrictions are understandably unpopular with photographers, and may be applied to both divers who manage to avoid contact and those who do not.
Changing the methods by which the industry provides services. Closer supervision and intervention by dive guides can reduce diver contact rates where the divers are sufficiently skilled to modify their behaviour during the dive. A pre-dive briefing on responsible behaviour, regulations and environmental values can reduce the rate of diver impacts where the divers are sufficiently competent to avoid contact. More effective interventions occur when the number of divers per guide is low.
Encouraging or enforcing competence of divers in low impact diving as a precondition for diving in sensitive areas. This has been identified as an effective way of reducing diver contact.


== Economics ==
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity. Significant capital outlay is required to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large to very large capital expense, and running costs and crew salaries can be considerable. There are also health and safety aspects to be considered, both for the operator and the customer, as high pressure filling equipment is used to provide breathing air which will be used in a hostile environment. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money, and annual registration fees are a required.


=== Sustainability ===
Three factors have been identified as important in economic sustainability:

Environmental awareness and conservation: The regions that are the most popular destinations for most recreational diver tourism are also those with the most fragile and vulnerable ecosystems. Divers have a tendency to choose their destinations based on reputation for a quality experience, which is largely related to the state of the ecosystem. Word gets around when a region's dive sites are deteriorating, and this adversely affects bookings and income. For sustainable business over the long term, the local service providers and communities need to ensure that the impact on the ecology is sustainable. To a large extent this involves ensuring that clients are competent to dive the local sites without damaging delicate organisms, which often requires a level of skill greater than the diver can sustain by diving only a few times a year.
Service delivery and customer satisfaction: Depending  on location, it may be difficult or impossible to consistently provide a satisfactory dive experience, as weather and sea conditions may not be predictable over the longer term. Consequently the type of diving tourism can vary considerably by region, with service providers in some places only able to confirm bookings a few days in advance, while in others a cancellation is the exception, and this may vary seasonally. Customer satisfaction is linked to expectations, and providers catering to a repeat market may be less likely to take the boat out on a day when conditions are forecast to be marginal by local standards.
Sustainable business management. (Return on investment, maintaining reputation, maintaining equipment, compliance with safety requirements etc)


=== Economic risks ===

International risks to the diving tourism industry include terrorism, economic recessions and global disease epidemics. Domestic risks within the borders of specific countries may include increased crime rates, and political instability.
Environmental degradation, partly due to the impact of recreational diving on the environment, where pollution and direct damage by divers have been recorded, and the effects of natural disasters and climate change such as increased water temperature causing coral bleaching are threatening the industry, as divers are less inclined to visit areas where these problems have been reported. Overexploitation by fishing and illegal extraction have led to some sites being closed and permit systems introduced, sometimes limiting the numbers of divers that may visit an area in a given time interval.
The global economic downturn has reduced spending on expensive leisure activities, reducing the income of tourism destinations, including scuba diving charters and diving schools, and political instability deters visitors to a region
Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.
A large proportion of divers visiting tropical coral reef destinations are international travellers – circumstances that may induce them not to travel, or not to visit a particular region can have a strong influence on the viability of a diving operation. A study on diving tourism in East Africa showed that the major environmental risks  for that region are overfishing and marine pollution. The economic risks are mainly price inflation and recessions, the social risks include global disease epidemics and international crime, and political instability and onerous visa regulations are the major political risks.


== Demographics ==

Recreational diving tourists appear to be male-dominated, with an average age in the mid thirties, a college education, and higher than average income, which is in keeping with the relatively high costs of equipment, training and travel.
The general population of American scuba diving participants are on average wealthier and better educated than the general population, and have a higher participation than average in individual and team sports, and extreme sports. Nearly 46% participate in running or jogging, and 36% swim for fitness. The DAN medical emergency line and fatality and injury monitoring program have reported that some divers get injured as a consequence of inadequate physical fitness.
A study to identify differences between local scuba divers and visitors in Florida showed that visitors had less certification and experience but spent more on scuba, compared to local resident divers. Cluster analysis identified four groups of scuba divers:

Fun-seeking belongers: Divers with a strong affiliation for group belonging, looking for fun and excitement, enjoyed diving in varied locations, enjoyed stimulating encounters and considered bonding with other divers important. They self-identified as belonging to the scuba community and sought to associate with other divers with similar attitudes. They tended to have more diving experience and spent more on scuba activities. Mostly males, and the majority unmarried.
Actualizers: Divers focused on challenge, self-recognition, and self-esteem values, likely to consider certification important and consider that overcoming the challenges is important to their self-image. Represented by more females than other groups, and lower income and expenditure on scuba activities.
Inner-circles: People who perceived diving as an opportunity to make new friends, and spend time with family and friends. Image as a diver relatively unimportant, and not driven to be part of the scuba diving community. Mostly married, male, well-educated, with less diving experience than average.
Moderates: Divers more likely to do a single dive in a day, and less focused on the characteristics typical of the other groups.


== Legal risk and liability ==
Participation in recreational diving implies acceptance of the inherent risks of the activity. Diver training includes training in procedures known to reduce these risks to a level considered acceptable by the certification agency, and issue of certification implies that the agency accepts that the instructor has assessed the diver to be sufficiently competent in these skills at the time of assessment and to be sufficiently informed to accept the asso",1
Utility software,"In computing, a ""utility"" is a program or module which is used to give a general-purpose result, for many different uses. A utility is intended for a wide range of users, rather than an ""app"" (application program) which might be intended to serve a specific purpose for specific users.
For example, a utility program may handle computer files or guard against computer viruses.


== Definition ==
Utility is a system software that corresponds towards analyzing, configuring and optimizing the computer.


== Common examples of utility programs ==
Anti-Virus
Archives
synchronisation
Disk compression
Disk Defragment
search bar
system restore
synchronisation
zip/unzip

The word ""utility"" has been used to mean a ""general-purpose computing tool"" for many decades, since at least 1960.

Pneumatics,"Pneumatics is the use of compressed air for mechanical motion.  It has many uses. 
Pneumatic transfer systems are employed in many industries to move powders and devices. Pneumatic devices are also used where electric motors cannot be used for safety reasons, such as deep in a mine where explosive dust or gases may be present.


== Examples of pneumatic tools ==
Pneumatic drill (jackhammer) used by road workers
Pneumatic nailgun
Pneumatic switches
Pneumatic actuators
Air compressors
Vacuum pumps
Barostat systems used in Neurogastroenterology and for researching
electricity

Cable Jetting - a way to install cables in ducts
Pneumatic mail systems
Air brakes on buses, trains, and trucks


== Comparison to Hydraulics ==
Both pneumatics and hydraulics are applications of fluid power. Pneumatics uses air, which is compressible, while hydraulics uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil or water.  


=== Advantages of pneumatics ===
The working fluid is very light in weight so supply hoses are not heavy.
Because the working fluid is (mostly) just air, there is usually no need for a return line for the working fluid and leaks of the working fluid tend not to be messy.
Because air is compressible, the equipment is less likely to be damaged by shock.  The air in pneumatics absorbs excessive force, whereas the fluid of hydraulics directly transfers force.


=== Advantages of hydraulics ===
Higher energy density owing to the much higher working pressures usually employed.
The hydraulic working fluid is basically incompressible, leading to a minimum of spring action. When hydraulic fluid flow is stopped, the slightest motion of the load releases the pressure on the load; there is no need to ""bleed off"" pressurised air to release the pressure on the load...

List of most expensive sculptures,"This is a list of the highest known prices paid for sculptures.


== Most valuable sculptures ==
Alberto Giacometti's L'Homme au doigt was auctioned for $141.3 million at Christie's in May 2015, the highest price for any sculpture at auction. Giacometti's L'Homme qui marche I had previously achieved the highest price of any sculpture when it was auctioned by Sotheby's in February 2010.  Selling for US$104.3 million, it ranks amongst the most valuable works of art.
In 2005, Constantin Brâncuși's Bird in Space broke records when it sold for $27.5 million. The previous world record was another work by Brâncuși called Danaide, which was sold for $18.1 million in May 2002.  The 2005 record stood for two years until a highly regarded work of antiquity surpassed the price. Artemis and the Stag, found in the 1920s at a Roman construction site, fetched $28.6 million in June 2007.  The record would only stand for a few months, with a work by Pablo Picasso, Tete de femme (Dora Maar), surpassing it by half a million US dollars in November 2007.
In December 2007, the sale of the Guennol Lioness, a statue from around 3000 BC, nearly doubled the previous record price when it sold for $57.2 million. It is the fifth-most valuable sculpture to date (2018) and the most valuable piece from antiquity.
Damien Hirst has claimed that his sculpture For the Love of God, which consists of a platinum cast of a human skull encrusted with 8,601 flawless diamonds, was sold for £50 million (around US$75 million) in August 2007.  The truth of this private sale, which was to an unknown consortium, has been called into question. If the sale did take place, For the Love of God would become the second-most expensive sculpture ever sold and would have fetched the highest price for a sculpture by a living artist.
2010 was a good year for record-breaking sculpture prices but it did not continue into 2011. Jeff Koons' porcelain Pink Panther was estimated to fetch a value of up to $30 million, but only achieved just over half that.
Louise Bourgeois holds the record ($32.1 million in 2019) for Spider, the highest price paid for an attributable sculpture by a woman (since the sculptor of Guennol Lioness is unknown).


== Auction details ==
All the most expensive sculptures have been sold by one of two auction houses: Sotheby's and Christie's. Sotheby's has hosted the auctions of the two works that reached the highest price, one in London and the other in New York.  Only three of the top ten have auctioned outside of New York; one in London and two in Paris.
The top ten highest value sculptures were made by seven different people, two of whom are unknown and will never be identified. An Alberto Giacometti sculpture is the most valuable modern work, and he has three more entries in the top ten. Four Constantin Brâncuși sculptures are featured on the list, and Jeff Koons' work appears three times. Although Pablo Picasso only appears once he appears numerous times in the list of most expensive paintings.
Several buyers have chosen to remain anonymous, while others publicly celebrate their purchases.


== Most expensive sculpture by a female artist ==
Louise Bourgeois' 1996 Spider is the most expensive sculpture by a woman artist, selling for $32.1 million in 2019.

Drawing,"Drawing is a way of making a picture.  Drawings are created by making lines on a surface. Long lines make up the shapes and small lines make the textures.  Drawings can be images of real-life or abstract images.
Drawing has been done for thousands of years, dating back to cave paintings.  It focuses on objects made by humans for any number of spiritual, narrative, philosophical, symbolic, conceptual, documentary, decorative, and even functional and other purposes.   


== Materials ==
Drawing paper is a special material sometimes used for drawing, however many just use paper. Pencils or pens are most commonly used for drawing. However, chalk, charcoal, and many others writing utensils are used.  


== Shading ==
Shading is the darkening or coloring of a drawing with lines or blocks of color. It can be used to make your drawings more three dimensional. Shading is the process of adding value to create an illusion of form, most importantly the light in a drawing. It should have a highlight (where the light is shining), mid tone (goes darker in color), Core shadow which is the darkest color on your drawing, then there is the reflected light. Reflecting light is where light shines on the object you are trying to draw.


== Hatching ==
Hatching is a artistic technique used to create tonal or shading effects by drawing closely spaced parallel lines. There are different types of hatching. There is Parallel hatching, contour, crosshatching, tick hatching, and more. There are many different ways you can do this.

Theory of art,"A theory of art is intended to contrast with a definition of art. Traditionally, definitions are composed of necessary and sufficient conditions, and a single counterexample overthrows such a definition. Theorizing about art, on the other hand, is analogous to a theory of a natural phenomenon like gravity. In fact, the intent behind a theory of art is to treat art as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated like any other. The question of whether one can speak of a theory of art without employing a concept of art is also discussed below.
The motivation behind seeking a theory, rather than a definition, is that our best minds have not been able to find definitions without counterexamples. The term ""definition"" assumes there are concepts, in something along Platonic lines, and a definition is an attempt to reach in and pluck out the essence of the concept and also assumes that at least some people have intellectual access to these concepts. In contrast, a 'conception' is an individual attempt to grasp at the putative essence behind this common term while nobody has ""access"" to the concept.
A theory of art presumes that each of us employs different conceptions of this unattainable art concept and as a result we must resort to worldly human investigation.


== Aesthetic response ==
Theories of aesthetic response or functional theories of art are in many ways the most intuitive theories of art. At its base, the term ""aesthetic"" refers to a type of phenomenal experience, and aesthetic definitions identify artworks with artifacts intended to produce aesthetic experiences. Nature can be beautiful and it can produce aesthetic experiences, but nature does not possess the intentional function of producing those experiences. For such a function, an intention is necessary, and thus agency – the artist.
Monroe Beardsley is commonly associated with aesthetic definitions of art. In Beardsley's words, something is art just in case it is ""either an arrangement of conditions intended to be capable of affording an experience with marked aesthetic character or (incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of arrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity"" (The aesthetic point of view: selected essays, 1982, 299). Painters arrange ""conditions"" in the paint/canvas medium, and dancers arrange the ""conditions"" of their bodily medium, for example. According to Beardsley's first disjunct, art has an intended aesthetic function, but not all artworks succeed in producing aesthetic experiences. The second disjunct allows for artworks that were intended to have this capacity, but failed at it (bad art).
Marcel Duchamp's Fountain is the paradigmatic counterexample to aesthetic definitions of art. Such works are said to be counterexamples because they are artworks that do not possess an intended aesthetic function. Beardsley replies that either such works are not art or they are ""comments on art"" (1983): ""To classify them [Fountain and the like] as artworks just because they make comments on art would be to classify a lot of dull and sometimes unintelligible magazine articles and newspaper reviews as artworks"" (p. 25). This response has been widely considered inadequate (REF). It is either question-begging or it relies on an arbitrary distinction between artworks and commentaries on artworks. A great many art theorists today consider aesthetic definitions of art to be extensionally inadequate, primarily because of artworks in the style of Duchamp.


== Formalist ==

The formalist theory of art asserts that we should focus only on the formal properties of art—the ""form"", not the ""content"". Those formal properties might include, for the visual arts, color, shape, and line, and, for the musical arts, rhythm and harmony. Formalists do not deny that works of art might have content, representation, or narrative--rather, they deny that those things are relevant in our appreciation or understanding of art.


== Institutional ==
The institutional theory of art is a theory about the nature of art that holds that an object can only become art in the context of the institution known as ""the art world"".
Addressing the issue of what makes, for example, Marcel Duchamp's ""readymades"" art, or why a pile of Brillo cartons in a supermarket is not art, whereas Andy Warhol's famous Brillo Boxes (a pile of Brillo carton replicas) is, the art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto wrote in his 1964 essay ""The Artworld"":

To see something as art requires something the eye cannot decry—an atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of the history of art: an artworld.
According to Robert J. Yanal, Danto's essay, in which he coined the term artworld, outlined the first institutional theory of art.
Versions of the institutional theory were formulated more explicitly by George Dickie in his article ""Defining Art"" (American Philosophical Quarterly, 1969) and his books Aesthetics: An Introduction (1971) and Art and the Aesthetic: An Institutional Analysis (1974). An early version of Dickie's institutional theory can be summed up in the following definition of work of art from Aesthetics: An Introduction:

A work of art in the classificatory sense is 1) an artifact 2) on which some person or persons acting on behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld) has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation.
Dickie has reformulated his theory in several books and articles. Other philosophers of art have criticized his definitions as being circular.


== Historical ==
Historical theories of art hold that for something to be art, it must bear some relation to existing works of art. For new works to be art, they must be similar or relate to previously established artworks. Such a definition raises the question of where this inherited status originated. That is why historical definitions of art must also include a disjunct for first art: Something is art if it possesses a historical relation to previous artworks, or is first art.
The philosopher primarily associated with the historical definition of art is Jerrold Levinson (1979). For Levinson, ""a work of art is a thing intended for regard-as-a-work-of-art: regard in any of the ways works of art existing prior to it have been correctly regarded"" (1979, p. 234). Levinson further clarifies that by ""intends for"" he means: ""[M]akes, appropriates or conceives for the purpose of'"" (1979, p. 236). Some of these manners for regard (at around the present time) are: to be regarded with full attention, to be regarded contemplatively, to be regarded with special notice to appearance, to be regarded with ""emotional openness"" (1979, p. 237). If an object is not intended for regard in any of the established ways, then it is not art.


== Anti-essentialist ==
Some art theorists have proposed that the attempt to define art must be abandoned and have instead urged an anti-essentialist theory of art. In 'The Role of Theory in Aesthetics' (1956), Morris Weitz famously argues that individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions will never be forthcoming for the concept 'art' because it is an ""open concept"". Weitz describes open concepts as those whose ""conditions of application are emendable and corrigible"" (1956, p. 31). In the case of borderline cases of art and prima facie counterexamples, open concepts ""call for some sort of decision on our part to extend the use of the concept to cover this, or to close the concept and invent a new one to deal with the new case and its new property"" (p. 31 ital. in original). The question of whether a new artifact is art ""is not factual, but rather a decision problem, where the verdict turns on whether or not we enlarge our set of conditions for applying the concept"" (p. 32). For Weitz, it is ""the very expansive, adventurous character of art, its ever-present changes and novel creations"", that makes the concept impossible to capture in a classical definition (as some static univocal essence).
While anti-essentialism was never formally defeated, it was challenged, and the debate over anti-essentialist theories was subsequently swept away by seemingly better essentialist definitions. Commenting after Weitz, Berys Gaut revived anti-essentialism in the philosophy of art with his paper '""Art"" as a Cluster Concept' (2000). Cluster concepts are composed of criteria that contribute to art status but are not individually necessary for art status. There is one exception: Artworks are created by agents, and so being an artifact is a necessary property for being an artwork. Gaut (2005) offers a set of ten criteria that contribute to art status:

(i) possessing positive aesthetic qualities (I employ the notion of positive aesthetic qualities here in a narrow sense, comprising beauty and its subspecies);
(ii) being expressive of emotion;
(iii) being intellectually challenging;
(iv) being formally complex and coherent;
(v) having a capacity to convey complex meanings;
(vi) exhibiting an individual point of view;
(vii) being an exercise of creative imagination;
(viii) being an artifact or performance that is the product of a high degree of skill;
(ix) belonging to an established artistic form; and
(x) being the product of an intention to make a work of art. (274)
Satisfying all ten criteria would be sufficient for art, as might any subset formed by nine criteria (this is a consequence of the fact that none of the ten properties is necessary). For example, consider two of Gaut's criteria: ""possessing aesthetic merit"" and ""being expressive of emotion"" (200, p. 28). Neither of these criteria is necessary for art status, but both are parts of subsets of these ten criteria that are sufficient for art status. Gaut's definition also allows for many subsets with less than nine criteria to be sufficient for art status, which leads to a highly pluralistic theory of art.
In 2021, the philosopher Jason Josephson Storm defended anti-essentialist definitions of art as part of a broader analysis of the role of macro-categories in the human sciences. Specifically, he argued that most essentialist attempts to answer Weitz's original argument fail because the criteria they propose to define art are not themselves present or identical across cultures.: 64  Storm went further and argued that Weitz's appeal to family resemblance to define art without essentialism is ultimately circular because it does not explain why similarities between ""art"" across cultures are relevant to defining it even anti-essentially.: 77–82  Instead, Storm applied a theory of social kinds to the category ""art"" that emphasized how different forms of art fulfill different ""cultural niches."": 124 
The theory of art is also impacted by a philosophical turn in thinking, not only exemplified by the aesthetics of Kant but is tied more closely to ontology and metaphysics in terms of the reflections of Heidegger on the essence of modern technology and the implications it has on all beings that are reduced to what he calls 'standing reserve', and it is from this perspective on the question of being that he explored art beyond the history, theory, and criticism of artistic production as embodied for instance in his influential opus: The Origin of the Work of Art. This has had also an impact on architectural thinking in its philosophical roots.


== Aesthetic creation ==
Zangwill describes the aesthetic-creation theory of art as a theory of ""how art comes to be produced"" (p. 167) and an ""artist-based"" theory. Zangwill distinguishes three phases in the production of a work of art:

[F]irst, there is the insight that by creating certain nonaesthetic properties, certain aesthetic properties will be realized; second, there is the intention to realize the aesthetic properties in the nonaesthetic properties, as envisaged in the insight; and, third, there is the more or less successful action of realizing the aesthetic properties in the nonaesthetic properties, an envisaged in the insight and intention. (45)
In the creation of an artwork, the insight plays a causal role in bringing about actions sufficient for realizing particular aesthetic properties. Zangwill does not describe this relation in detail, but only says it is ""because of"" this insight that the aesthetic properties are created.
Aesthetic properties are instantiated by nonaesthetic properties that ""include physical properties, such as shape and size, and secondary qualities, such as colours or sounds."" (37) Zangwill says that aesthetic properties supervene on the nonaesthetic properties: it is because of the particular nonaesthetic properties it has that the work possesses certain aesthetic properties (and not the other way around).


== What is ""art""? ==

Since art often depicts functional purposes and sometimes has no function other than to convey or communicate an idea, then how best to define the term ""art"" is a subject of constant contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term ""art"". Theodor Adorno claimed in his Aesthetic Theory (1969), ""It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident."" Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists, and programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields and give it operational definitions that vary considerably. Furthermore, it is clear that even the basic meaning of the term ""art"" has changed several times over the centuries, and has continued to evolve during the 20th century as well.
The main recent sense of the word ""art"" is roughly as an abbreviation for ""fine art"". Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist's creativity, engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or draw the audience toward consideration of the ""finer"" things. Often, if the skill is being used in a functional object, people will consider it a craft instead of art, a suggestion that is highly disputed by many contemporary craft thinkers. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered design instead of art, or contrariwise, these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called applied art. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with the actual function of the object than any clear definitional difference.
Even as late as 1912, it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at beauty, and thus that anything that was not trying to be beautiful could not count as art. The cubists, dadaists, Stravinsky, and many later art movements struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of art, with such success that, according to Danto, ""Beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art of the 1960s but from the advanced philosophy of art of that decade as well."" Perhaps some notion like ""expression"" (in Croce's theories) or ""counter-environment"" (in McLuhan's theory) can replace the previous role of beauty. Brian Massumi brought back ""beauty"" into consideration together with ""expression"". Another view, as important to the philosophy of art as ""beauty"", is that of the ""sublime"", elaborated upon in the twentieth century by the postmodern philosopher Jean-François Lyotard. A further approach, elaborated by André Malraux in works such as The Voices of Silence, is that art is fundamentally a response to a metaphysical question (""Art"", he writes, ""is an 'anti-destiny'""). Malraux argues that, while art has sometimes been oriented toward beauty and the sublime (principally in post-Renaissance European art), these qualities, as the wider history of art demonstrates, are by no means essential to it.
Perhaps (as in Kennick's theory) no definition of art is possible anymore. Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a Wittgensteinian fashion (as in Weitz or Beuys). Another approach is to say that ""art"" is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools, museums, and artists define as art is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This ""institutional definition of art"" (see also Institutional Critique) has been championed by George Dickie. Most people did not consider the depiction of a store-bought urinal or Brillo Box to be art until Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the art gallery), which then provided the association of these objects with the associations that define art.
Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. If a poet writes down several lines, intending them as a poem, the very procedure by which it is written makes it a poem. Whereas if a journalist writes exactly the same set of words, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem. Leo Tolstoy, on the other hand, claims in his What is art? (1897) that what decides whether something is art is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like Monroe Beardsley argue that whether a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a nonartistic function in one context (carrying wine) and an artistic function in another context (helping us appreciate the beauty of the human figure).
Marxist attempts to define art focus on its place in the mode of production, such as in Walter Benjamin's essay The Author as Producer, and/or its political role in class struggle. Revising some concepts of the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, Gary Tedman defines art in terms of social reproduction of the relations of production on the aesthetic level.


== What should art be like? ==
Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another is superior in some way. Clement Greenberg, for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form. The Dadaist Tristan Tzara on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. ""We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits."" Formal goals, creative goals, self-expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art should be like.


== The value of art ==
Tolstoy defined art as the following: ""Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them."" However, this definition is merely a starting point for his theory of art's value. To some extent, the value of art, for Tolstoy, is one with the value of empathy. However, sometimes empathy is not of value. In chapter fifteen of What Is Art?, Tolstoy says that some feelings are good, but others are bad, and so art is only valuable when it generates empathy or shared feeling for good feelings. For example, Tolstoy asserts that empathy for decadent members of the ruling class makes society worse, rather than better. In chapter sixteen, he asserts that the best art is ""universal art"" that expresses simple and accessible positive feeling.
An argument for the value of art, used in the fictional work The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, proceeds that, if some external force presenting imminent destruction of Earth asked humanity what its value was—what should humanity's response be? The argument continues that the only justification humanity could give for its continued existence would be the past creation and continued creation of things like a Shakespeare play, a Rembrandt painting or a Bach concerto. The suggestion is that these are the things of value that define humanity. Whatever one might think of this claim — and it does seem to undervalue the many other achievements of which human beings have shown themselves capable, both individually and collectively — it is true that art appears to possess a special capacity to endure (""live on"") beyond the moment of its birth, in many cases for centuries or millennia. This capacity of art to endure over time — what precisely it is and how it operates — has been widely neglected in modern aesthetics.


== Set theory of art ==
A set theory of art has been underlined in according to the notion that everything is art. Here - higher than such states is proposed while lower than such states is developed for reference; thus showing that art theory is sprung up to guard against complacency. 

Everything is art.
A set example of this would be an eternal set large enough to incorporate everything; with a work of art-example given as Ben Vautier's 'Universe'.

Everything and then some more is art (Everything+)
A set of this would be an eternal set incorporated in it a small circle; with a work of art-example given as Aronsson's 'Universe Orange' (which consists of a starmap of the universe bylining a natural-sized physical orange).

Everything that can be created (without practical use) is art (Everything-) 
A set of this would be a shadow set (universe) much to the likelihood of a negative universe.

Everything that can be experienced is art (Everything--)
A set of this would be a finite set legally interacting with other sets without losing its position as premier set (the whole); with a work of art-example given as a picture of the 'Orion Nebula' (Unknown Artist).

Everything that exists, have been existing, and will ever exist is art (Everything++)
A set of this would be an infinite set consisting of every parallel universe; with a work of art-example given as Marvels 'Omniverse'.

Prophet,"Prophets are people who said that God or gods talked to them. They freely teach other people what they learned. Most of them warn people that something very good will happen if they live good lives. Or if they sin, God will punish them.

Persons who think bad things  will happen are sometimes made fun of as being ""prophets of doom"". A person who says things will happen, but they don't happen are called ""false prophets"". 
There are prophets in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Sanamahism, Zoroastrianism, and in other religions. 
For the main Abrahamic religions, there are two kinds of prophets, major and minor. Major prophets gave a lot of teachings while minor prophets do not have many teachings. Isaiah and Elijah are also important. Elijah didn't write any books in the Bible but did many miracles and told kings that God would punish them. 
In Christianity, Jesus was the main prophet. Other Christian prophets are mentioned in the New Testament, both men and women. John, a disciple of Jesus wrote the Book of Revelation which has many prophecies.  
In Islam, Muhammad is considered the last prophet. Muslims also consider Moses and Jesus to be prophets and many others who lived before the time of Muhammed. Some modern religions say that their founder is a prophet, such as Joseph Smith.

Austerity,"In economic policy, austerity is a set of political-economic policies that aim to reduce government budget deficits through spending cuts, tax increases, or a combination of both. There are three primary types of austerity measures: higher taxes to fund spending, raising taxes while cutting spending, and lower taxes and lower government spending. Austerity measures are often used by governments that find it difficult to borrow or meet their existing obligations to pay back loans. The measures are meant to reduce the budget deficit by bringing government revenues closer to expenditures. Proponents of these measures state that this reduces the amount of borrowing required and may also demonstrate a government's fiscal discipline to creditors and credit rating agencies and make borrowing easier and cheaper as a result.
In most macroeconomic models, austerity policies which reduce government spending lead to increased unemployment in the short term. These reductions in employment usually occur directly in the public sector and indirectly in the private sector. Where austerity policies are enacted using tax increases, these can reduce consumption by cutting household disposable income. Reduced government spending can reduce gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the short term as government expenditure is itself a component of GDP. In the longer term, reduced government spending can reduce GDP growth if, for example, cuts to education spending leave a country's workforce less able to do high-skilled jobs or if cuts to infrastructure investment impose greater costs on business than they saved through lower taxes. In both cases, if reduced government spending leads to reduced GDP growth, austerity may lead to a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than the alternative of the government running a higher budget deficit. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, austerity measures in many European countries were followed by rising unemployment and slower GDP growth. The result was increased debt-to-GDP ratios despite reductions in budget deficits.
Theoretically in some cases, particularly when the output gap is low, austerity can have the opposite effect and stimulate economic growth. For example, when an economy is operating at or near capacity, higher short-term deficit spending (stimulus) can cause interest rates to rise, resulting in a reduction in private investment, which in turn reduces economic growth. Where there is excess capacity, the stimulus can result in an increase in employment and output. Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, and Francesco Giavazzi argue that austerity can be expansionary in situations where government reduction in spending is offset by greater increases in aggregate demand (private consumption, private investment, and exports).


== History ==
The origin of modern austerity measures is mostly undocumented among academics. During the United States occupation of Haiti that began in 1915, the United States utilized austerity policies where American corporations received a low tax rate while Haitians saw their taxes increase, with a forced labor system creating a ""corporate paradise"" in occupied Haiti. Another historical example of contemporary austerity is Fascist Italy during a liberal period of the economy from 1922 to 1925. The fascist government utilized austerity policies to prevent the democratization of Italy following World War I, with Luigi Einaudi, Maffeo Pantaleoni, Umberto Ricci and Alberto de' Stefani leading this movement. Austerity measures used by the Weimar Republic of Germany were unpopular and contributed towards the increased support for the Nazi Party in the 1930s.


== Justifications ==
Austerity measures are typically pursued if there is a threat that a government cannot honour its debt obligations. This may occur when a government has borrowed in currencies that it has no right to issue, for example a South American country that borrows in US dollars. It may also occur if a country uses the currency of an independent central bank that is legally restricted from buying government debt, for example in the Eurozone.
In such a situation, banks and investors may lose confidence in a government's ability or willingness to pay, and either refuse to roll over existing debts, or demand extremely high interest rates. International financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may demand austerity measures as part of Structural Adjustment Programmes when acting as lender of last resort.
Austerity policies may also appeal to the wealthier class of creditors, who prefer low inflation and the higher probability of payback on their government securities by less profligate governments. More recently austerity has been pursued after governments became highly indebted by assuming private debts following banking crises. (This occurred after Ireland assumed the debts of its private banking sector during the European debt crisis. This rescue of the private sector resulted in calls to cut back the profligacy of the public sector.)
According to Mark Blyth, the concept of austerity emerged in the 20th century, when large states acquired sizable budgets. However, Blyth argues that the theories and sensibilities about the role of the state and capitalist markets that underline austerity emerged from the 17th century onwards. Austerity is grounded in liberal economics' view of the state and sovereign debt as deeply problematic. Blyth traces the discourse of austerity back to John Locke's theory of private property and derivative theory of the state, David Hume's ideas about money and the virtue of merchants, and Adam Smith's theories on economic growth and taxes. On the basis of classic liberal ideas, austerity emerged as a doctrine of neoliberalism in the 20th century.
Economist David M. Kotz suggests that the implementation of austerity measures following the 2007–2008 financial crisis was an attempt to preserve the neoliberal capitalist model.


== Theoretical considerations ==

In the 1930s during the Great Depression, anti-austerity arguments gained more prominence. John Maynard Keynes became a well known anti-austerity economist, arguing that ""The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury.""
Contemporary Keynesian economists argue that budget deficits are appropriate when an economy is in recession, to reduce unemployment and help spur GDP growth. According to Paul Krugman, since a government is not like a household, reductions in government spending during economic downturns worsen the crisis.
Across an economy, one person's spending is another person's income. In other words, if everyone is trying to reduce their spending, the economy can be trapped in what economists call the paradox of thrift, worsening the recession as GDP falls. In the past this has been offset by encouraging consumerism to rely on debt, but after the 2008 crisis, this has looked like a less and less viable option for sustainable economics.
Krugman argues that, if the private sector is unable or unwilling to consume at a level that increases GDP and employment sufficiently, then the government should be spending more in order to offset the decline in private spending. Keynesian theory is proposed as being responsible for post-war boom years, before the 1970s, and when public sector investment was at its highest across Europe, partially encouraged by the Marshall Plan.
An important component of economic output is business investment, but there is no reason to expect it to stabilize at full utilization of the economy's resources. High business profits do not necessarily lead to increased economic growth. (When businesses and banks have a disincentive to spend accumulated capital, such as cash repatriation taxes from profits in overseas tax havens and interest on excess reserves paid to banks, increased profits can lead to decreasing growth.)
Economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote in April 2013, ""Austerity seldom works without structural reforms – for example, changes in taxes, regulations and labor market policies – and if poorly designed, can disproportionately hit the poor and middle class. Our consistent advice has been to avoid withdrawing fiscal stimulus too quickly, a position identical to that of most mainstream economists.""
To help improve the U.S. economy, they (Rogoff and Reinhart) advocated reductions in mortgage principal for 'underwater homes' – those whose negative equity (where the value of the asset is less than the mortgage principal) can lead to a stagnant housing market with no realistic opportunity to reduce private debts.


=== Multiplier effects ===
In October 2012, the IMF announced that its forecasts for countries that implemented austerity programs have been consistently overoptimistic, suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected and that countries that implemented fiscal stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected.
The IMF reported that this was due to fiscal multipliers that were considerably larger than expected: for example, the IMF estimated that fiscal multipliers based on data from 28 countries ranged between 0.9 and 1.7. In other words, a 1% GDP fiscal consolidation (i.e., austerity) would reduce GDP between 0.9% and 1.7%, thus inflicting far more economic damage than the 0.5 previously estimated in IMF forecasts.
In many countries, little is known about the size of multipliers, as data availability limits the scope for empirical research.
For these countries, Nicoletta Batini, Luc Eyraud and Anke Weber propose a simple method—dubbed the ""bucket approach""—to come up with reasonable multiplier estimates. The approach bunches countries into groups (or ""buckets"") with similar multiplier values, based on their characteristics, and taking into account the effect of (some) temporary factors such as the state of the business cycle.
Different tax and spending choices of equal magnitude have different economic effects:
For example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that the payroll tax (levied on all wage earners) has a higher multiplier (impact on GDP) than does the income tax (which is levied primarily on wealthier workers). In other words, raising the payroll tax by $1 as part of an austerity strategy would slow the economy more than would raising the income tax by $1, resulting in less net deficit reduction.
In theory, it would stimulate the economy and reduce the deficit if the payroll tax were lowered and the income tax raised in equal amounts.


=== Crowding in or out ===

The term ""crowding out"" refers to the extent to which an increase in the budget deficit offsets spending in the private sector. Economist Laura Tyson wrote in June 2012, ""By itself an increase in the deficit, either in the form of an increase in government spending or a reduction in taxes, causes an increase in demand"". How this affects output, employment, and growth depends on what happens to interest rates:
When the economy is operating near capacity, government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit causes interest rates to rise and higher interest rates reduce or ""crowd out"" private investment, reducing growth. This theory explains why large and sustained government deficits take a toll on growth: they reduce capital formation. But this argument rests on how government deficits affect interest rates, and the relationship between government deficits and interest rates varies.
When there is considerable excess capacity, an increase in government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit does not lead to higher interest rates and does not crowd out private investment. Instead, the higher demand resulting from the increase in the deficit bolsters employment and output directly. The resultant increase in income and economic activity in turn encourages, or ""crowds in"", additional private spending.
Some argue that the ""crowding-in"" model is an appropriate solution for current economic conditions.


=== Government budget balance as a sectoral component ===

According to economist Martin Wolf, the U.S. and many Eurozone countries experienced rapid increases in their budget deficits in the wake of the 2008 crisis as a result of significant private-sector retrenchment and ongoing capital account surpluses.
Policy choices had little to do with these deficit increases. This makes austerity measures counterproductive. Wolf explained that government fiscal balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in a country's economy, along with the foreign financial sector (capital account) and the private financial sector.
By definition, the sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero. In the U.S. and many Eurozone countries other than Germany, a foreign financial surplus exists because capital is imported (net) to fund the trade deficit. Further, there is a private-sector financial surplus because household savings exceed business investment.
By definition, a government budget deficit must exist so all three net to zero: for example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% of GDP (8.6% of GDP of which was federal), offsetting a foreign financial surplus of 4% of GDP and a private-sector surplus of 6% of GDP.
Wolf explained in July 2012 that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the U.S. government balance into deficit: ""The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak. ... No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.""
Wolf also wrote that several European economies face the same scenario and that a lack of deficit spending would likely have resulted in a depression. He argued that a private-sector depression (represented by the private- and foreign-sector surpluses) was being ""contained"" by government deficit spending.
Economist Paul Krugman also explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private-sector deficit to surplus in the U.S.: ""This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers.""
One reason why austerity can be counterproductive in a downturn is due to a significant private-sector financial surplus, in which consumer savings is not fully invested by businesses. In a healthy economy, private-sector savings placed into the banking system by consumers are borrowed and invested by companies. However, if consumers have increased their savings but companies are not investing the money, a surplus develops.
Business investment is one of the major components of GDP. For example, a U.S. private-sector financial deficit from 2004 to 2008 transitioned to a large surplus of savings over investment that exceeded $1 trillion by early 2009, and remained above $800 billion into September 2012. Part of this investment reduction was related to the housing market, a major component of investment. This surplus explains how even significant government deficit spending would not increase interest rates (because businesses still have access to ample savings if they choose to borrow and invest it, so interest rates are not bid upward) and how Federal Reserve action to increase the money supply does not result in inflation (because the economy is awash with savings with no place to go).
Economist Richard Koo described similar effects for several of the developed world economies in December 2011: ""Today private sectors in the U.S., the U.K., Spain, and Ireland (but not Greece) are undergoing massive deleveraging [paying down debt rather than spending] in spite of record low interest rates. This means these countries are all in serious balance sheet recessions. The private sectors in Japan and Germany are not borrowing, either. With borrowers disappearing and banks reluctant to lend, it is no wonder that, after nearly three years of record low interest rates and massive liquidity injections, industrial economies are still doing so poorly. Flow of funds data for the U.S. show a massive shift away from borrowing to savings by the private sector since the housing bubble burst in 2007. The shift for the private sector as a whole represents over 9 percent of U.S. GDP at a time of zero interest rates. Moreover, this increase in private sector savings exceeds the increase in government borrowings (5.8 percent of GDP), which suggests that the government is not doing enough to offset private sector deleveraging.""


== Framing of the debate surrounding austerity ==
Many scholars have argued that how the debate surrounding austerity is framed has a heavy impact on the view of austerity in the public eye, and how the public understands macroeconomics as a whole. Wren-Lewis, for example, coined the term 'mediamacro', which refers to ""the role of the media reproducing particularly corrosive forms of economic illiteracy—of which the idea that deficits are ipso facto 'bad' is a strong example."" This can go as far as ignoring economists altogether; however, it often manifests itself as a drive in which a minority of economists whose ideas about austerity have been thoroughly debunked being pushed to the front to justify public policy, such as in the case of Alberto Alesina (2009), whose pro-austerity works were ""thoroughly debunked by the likes of the economists, the IMF, and the Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP)."" Other anti-austerity economists, such as Seymour have argued that the debate must be reframed as a social and class movement, and its impact judged accordingly, since statecraft is viewed as the main goal.
Further, critics such as Major have highlighted how the OECD and associated international finance organisations have framed the debate to promote austerity, for example, the concept of 'wage-push inflation' which ignores the role played by the profiteering of private companies, and seeks to blame inflation on wages being too high.


== Empirical considerations ==
According to a 2020 study, austerity increases the risk of default in situations of severe fiscal stress, but reduces the risk of default in situations of low fiscal stress.


=== Europe ===


==== Eurozone ====
During the European debt crisis, many countries embarked on austerity programs, reducing their budget deficits relative to GDP from 2010 to 2011.
According to the CIA World Factbook, Greece decreased its budget deficit from 10.4% of GDP in 2010 to 9.6% in 2011. Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, and Spain also decreased their budget deficits from 2010 to 2011 relative to GDP but the austerity policy of the Eurozone achieves not only the reduction of budget deficits. The goal of economic consolidation influences the future development of the European social model.
With the exception of Germany, each of these countries had public-debt-to-GDP ratios that increased from 2010 to 2011, as indicated in the chart at right. Greece's public-debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 143% in 2010 to 165% in 2011 Indicating despite declining budget deficits GDP growth was not sufficient to support a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio for these countries during this period.
Eurostat reported that the overall debt-to-GDP ratio for the EA17 was 70.1% in 2008, 80.0% in 2009, 85.4% in 2010, 87.3% in 2011, and 90.6% in 2012.
Further, real GDP in the EA17 declined for six straight quarters from Q4 2011 to Q1 2013.
Unemployment is another variable considered in evaluating austerity measures. According to the CIA World Factbook, from 2010 to 2011, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and the UK increased. France and Italy had no significant changes, while in Germany and Iceland the unemployment rate declined. Eurostat reported that Eurozone unemployment reached record levels in March 2013 at 12.1%, up from 11.6% in September 2012 and 10.3% in 2011. Unemployment varied significantly by country.
Economist Martin Wolf analyzed the relationship between cumulative GDP growth in 2008 to 2012 and total reduction in budget deficits due to austerity policies in several European countries during April 2012 (see chart at right). He concluded, ""In all, there is no evidence here that large fiscal contractions budget deficit reductions bring benefits to confidence and growth that offset the direct effects of the contractions. They bring exactly what one would expect: small contractions bring recessions and big contractions bring depressions.""
Changes in budget balances (deficits or surpluses) explained approximately 53% of the change in GDP, according to the equation derived from the IMF data used in his analysis.
Similarly, economist Paul Krugman analyzed the relationship between GDP and reduction in budget deficits for several European countries in April 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth. He wrote: ""this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0.4 euros of reduced deficit, even in the short run. No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster.""


===== Greece =====

The Greek government-debt crisis brought a package of austerity measures, put forth by the EU and the IMF mostly in the context of the three successive bailouts the country endured from 2010 to 2018; it was met with great anger by the Greek public, leading to riots and social unrest. On 27 June 2011, trade union organizations began a 48-hour labour strike in advance of a parliamentary vote on the austerity package, the first such strike since 1974.
Massive demonstrations were organized throughout Greece, intended to pressure members of parliament into voting against the package. The second set of austerity measures was approved on 29 June 2011, with 155 out of 300 members of parliament voting in favor. However, one United Nations official warned that the second package of austerity measures in Greece could pose a violation of human rights.
Around 2011, the IMF started issuing guidance suggesting that austerity could be harmful when applied without regard to an economy's underlying fundamentals.
In 2013, it published a detailed analysis concluding that ""if financial markets focus on the short-term behavior of the debt ratio, or if country authorities engage in repeated rounds of tightening in an effort to get the debt ratio to converge to the official target"", austerity policies could slow or reverse economic growth and inhibit full employment. Keynesian economists and commentators such as Paul Krugman have suggested that this has in fact been occurring, with austerity yielding worse results in proportion to the extent to which it has been imposed.
Overall, Greece lost 25% of its GDP during the crisis. Although the government debt increased only 6% between 2009 and 2017 (from €300 bn to €318 bn) — thanks, in part, to the 2012 debt restructuring —, the critical debt-to-GDP ratio shot up from 127% to 179% mostly due to the severe GDP drop during the handling of the crisis. In all, the Greek economy suffered the longest recession of any advanced capitalist economy to date, overtaking the US Great Depression. As such, the crisis adversely affected the populace as the series of sudden reforms and austerity measures led to impoverishment and loss of income and property, as well as a small-scale humanitarian crisis. Unemployment shot up from 8% in 2008 to 27% in 2013 and remained at 22% in 2017. As a result of the crisis, Greek political system has been upended, social exclusion increased, and hundreds of thousands of well-educated Greeks left the country.


===== France =====
In April and May 2012, France held a presidential election in which the winner, François Hollande, had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate France's budget deficit by 2017 by canceling recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over one million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases, and building additional public housing for the poor. In the legislative elections in June, Hollande's Socialist Party won a supermajority capable of amending the French Constitution and enabling the immediate enactment of the promised reforms. Interest rates on French government bonds fell by 30% to record lows, fewer than 50 basis points above German government bond rates.


===== Latvia =====
Latvia's economy returned to growth in 2011 and 2012, outpacing the 27 nations in the EU, while implementing significant austerity measures. Advocates of austerity argue that Latvia represents an empirical example of the benefits of austerity, while critics argue that austerity created unnecessary hardship with the output in 2013 still below the pre-crisis level. While Anders Åslund maintains that internal devaluation was not opposed by the Latvian public, Jokubas Salyga has recently chronicled widespread protests against austerity in the country.
According to the CIA World Fact Book, ""Latvia's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per year during 2006–07, but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure amid the softening world economy. Triggered by the collapse of the second largest bank, GDP plunged 18% in 2009. The economy has not returned to pre-crisis levels despite strong growth, especially in the export sector in 2011–12. The IMF, EU, and other international donors provided substantial financial assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement to defend the currency's peg to the euro in exchange for the government's commitment to stringent austerity measures.
The IMF/EU program successfully concluded in December 2011. The government of Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis remained committed to fiscal prudence and reducing the fiscal deficit from 7.7% of GDP in 2010, to 2.7% of GDP in 2012."" The CIA estimated that Latvia's GDP declined by 0.3% in 2010, then grew by 5.5% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012. Unemployment was 12.8% in 2011 and rose to 14.3% in 2012. Latvia's currency, the Lati, fell from $0.47 per U.S. dollar in 2008 to $0.55 in 2012, a decline of 17%. Latvia entered the euro zone in 2014. Latvia's trade deficit improved from over 20% of GDP in 2006 to 2007 to under 2% GDP by 2012.
Eighteen months after harsh austerity measures were enacted (including both spending cuts and tax increases), economic growth began to return, although unemployment remained above pre-crisis levels. Latvian exports have skyrocketed and both the trade deficit and budget deficit have decreased dramatically. More than one-third of government positions were eliminated, and the rest received sharp pay cuts. Exports increased after goods prices were reduced due to private business lowering wages in tandem with the government.
Paul Krugman wrote in January 2013 that Latvia had yet to regain its pre-crisis level of employment. He also wrote, ""So we're looking at a Depression-level slump, and 5 years later only a partial bounceback; unemployment is down but still very high, and the decline has a lot to do with emigration. It's not what you'd call a triumphant success story, any more than the partial US recovery from 1933 to 1936—which was actually considerably more impressive—represented a huge victory over the Depression. And it's in no sense a refutation of Keynesianism, either. Even in Keynesian models, a small open economy can, in the long run, restore full employment through deflation and internal devaluation; the point, however, is that it involves many years of suffering"".
Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis defended his policies in a television interview, stating that Krugman refused to admit his error in predicting that Latvia's austerity policy would fail. Krugman had written a blog post in December 2008 entitled ""Why Latvia is the New Argentina"", in which he argued for Latvia to devalue its currency as an alternative or in addition to austerity.


==== United Kingdom ====


===== Post war austerity =====

Following the Second World War the United Kingdom had huge debts, large commitments, and had sold many income producing assets.  Rationing of food and other goods which had started in the war continued for some years.


===== 21st century austerity programme =====

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 a period of economic recession began in the UK. The austerity programme was initiated in 2010 by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government, despite some opposition from the academic community. In his June 2010 budget speech, the Chancellor George Osborne identified two goals. The first was that the structural current budget deficit would be eliminated to ""achieve cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of the rolling, five-year forecast period"". The second was that national debt as a percentage of GDP would fall. The government intended to achieve both of its goals through substantial reductions in public expenditure. This was to be achieved by a combination of public spending reductions and tax increases. Economists Alberto Alesina, Carlo A. Favero and Francesco Giavazzi, writing in Finance & Development in 2018, argued that deficit reduction policies based on spending cuts typically have almost no effect on output, and hence form a better route to achieving a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio than raising taxes. The authors commented that the UK government austerity programme had resulted in growth that was higher than the European average and that the UK's economic performance had been much stronger than the International Monetary Fund had predicted. This claim was challenged most strongly by Mark Blyth, whose 2014 book on austerity claims that austerity not only fails to stimulate growth, but effectively passes that debt down to the working classes. As such, many academics such as Andrew Gamble view Austerity in Britain less as an economic necessity, and more as a tool of statecraft, driven by ideology and not economic requirements. A study published in The BMJ in November 2017 found the Conservative government austerity programme had been linked to approximately 120,000 deaths since 2010; however, this was disputed, for example on the grounds that it was an observational study which did not show cause and effect. More studies claim adverse effects of austerity on population health, which include an increase in the mortality rate among pensioners which has been linked to unprecedented reductions in income support, an increase in suicides and the prescription of antidepressants for patients with mental health issues, and an increase in violence, self-harm, and suicide in prisons.


=== United States ===

The United States' response to the 2008 economic crash was largely influenced by Wall Street and IMF interests, who favored fiscal retrenchment in the face of the economic crash. Evidence exists to suggest that Pete Peterson (and the Petersonites) have heavily influenced US policy on economic recovery since the Nixon era, and presented itself in 2008, despite austerity measures being ""wildly out of step with public opinion and reputable economic policy...[and showing] anti-Keynesian bias of supply-side economics and a political system skewed to favor Wall Street over Main Street"". The nuance of the economic logic of Keynesianism is, however, difficult to put across to the American Public, and compares poorly to the simplistic message which blames government spending, which might explain Obama's preferred position of a halfway point between economic stimulus followed by austerity, which led to him being criticized by economists such as Joseph Stiglitz.


== Controversy ==

Austerity programs can be controversial. In the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) briefing paper ""The IMF and the Third World"", the ODI addresses five major complaints against the IMF's austerity conditions. Complaints include such measures being ""anti-developmental"", ""self-defeating"", and tending ""to have an adverse impact on the poorest segments of the population"".
In many situations, austerity programs are imple",1
Comics,"In comics, stories or information are given using pictures, or pictures and words together. A story is told with pictures, mostly in panels.  The first panel is supposed to be read first, and takes place earlier in time than the panels that follow it.
There are many kinds of comics.  Comic strips are short comics which are often found in newspapers.  Comic books are thin comics magazines.  Graphic novels are books of comics.  In Japan, comics are very popular, and Japanese comics are popular around the world. The Japanese word for comics is manga, and people use this word for Japanese comics in English and other languages.
The first comic strips in the United States were funny. ""Comic"" is another word for ""funny"", so they were called ""comic strips"". The first comic books were collections of comic strips. Today, some comics are serious, but they are still called ""comics"".
In comics, speech is usually shown through word balloons.  There are many different kinds of balloons, such as the ""speech balloon"", the ""thought balloon"" and the ""scream balloon"".

Loan,"A loan is a type of debt. The borrower agrees to repay the lender the sum of money loaned, at a particular time. It is often paid part by part over time, in order to clear the debt.
Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main tasks for financial institutions. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a main source of funding. Bank loans and credit are one way to increase the money supply.


== Important components of a loan ==
A loan can be broadly described by the following terms. 


=== Deposit or Down-payment ===
The deposit or down-payment is an amount of money that the borrower is required to pay, as the first contribution towards clearing the debt, so that the loan deal can be finalized. The deposit is usually higher than the monthly contribution towards the loan. Some loans require a deposit while some do not. The deposit is usually a fraction, typically a percentage, of the total amount that is loaned out.


=== Installments ===
An Installment is money that is a monthly payment towards the loan. It may not be necessarily paid monthly but it has to be paid from time to time over throughout the loan deal. Installments are paid according to a loan rate.


=== Interest ===
Interest is a charge on top of the value of the loan, that acts as a cost of the loan. Interest is paid according to a rate called an interest rate. The interest rate varies from loan to loan and from lender to lender.


== Loan payment ==
The most typical loan payment type is the fully amortizing payment in which each monthly rate has the same value over time.
The fixed monthly payment P for a loan of L for n months and a monthly interest rate c is:

== Types of loan ==
Loans can be broadly classified as either secured or unsecured loans.


=== Secured and unsecured loans ===
Secured loans are loans for which the borrower is required to guarantee repayment, by pledging with property, for instance a car, a house etc. This property is called security or collateral. Because of the pledging, secured loans are given in larger amounts and have lower interest rates. However, there is a risk of losing the property used as security, in the event that the loan is not paid off.
An example of a secured loan is a mortgage.
Unsecured loans are loans that are given without pledges of repayment. This means that the borrower is not required to provide security to get the loan.
Because of the high risk involved, unsecured loans are given out in smaller amounts and have higher interest rates. The lenders raise the interest rates in an effort to recover their money as quickly as possible. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.


=== Personal loans ===
A personal loan is a 'small expense' loan that is mostly used by people to finance day to day emergencies. They come in smaller amounts and
therefore, just like most unsecured loans, they are easily approved.


=== Home loans ===
Home loans are loans that are taken for the purpose of buying a house.
Home loans are secured loans. The house acts as a collateral or security
to the loan.


=== Payday loans ===
Payday loans  are signature loans or cash advances that requires no security. This means that it is possible to get a payday loan even with a bad credit status or no credit at all. Payday loans are given on the basis of employment and income.
However, payday loans have a high interest rate especially when the paying schedule is not followed. The high interest rates are a cost of convenience. Interest could run as high as 2000%, for this reason, it is not a good idea to take a payday loan if you don't expect to earn enough to repay it.


=== Auto loans ===
Auto loans are loans given out by financial institutions or car dealerships, for the purpose of buying an automobile. Due to the nature of automobiles to lose value with time, Auto loans usually have high interest rates. The shorter the time an auto loan is paid, the lower the overall cost of the loan will be.


=== Mortgage ===
Mortgage is a loan that is used specifically to purchase a house. Usually, a mortgage is given to you by a mortgage company or any financial institution, after evaluation of your potential to pay back the loan in full. A mortgage is a secured loan, therefore, providing collateral is necessary. Mortgage can be further classified into long-term and short-term mortgages, depending on the length of time required for the mortgage to be paid. Short-term mortgages usually have a term of 15 years while long–term mortgages have a 30-year term.


=== Credit card loans ===
When you get a credit card, you have taken a loan. This is a credit card loan, and just like any other loan, it comes with interest and fees. Credit card loans are given out by credit companies and most banks today. The interest rates on credit card loans are higher than that on most personal loans, often around 15%.

Wick effect,"The wick effect is an alleged partial or total destruction of a human body by fire, when the clothing of the victim soaks up melted human fat and acts like the wick of a candle. The wick effect is a phenomenon that is found to occur under certain conditions, and has been thoroughly observed.


== Details ==
The wick effect theory says a person is kept aflame through their own fats after being ignited, accidentally or otherwise.  The clothed human body acts like an ""inside-out"" candle, with the fuel source (human fat) inside and the wick (the clothing of the victim) outside.  Hence there is a continuous supply of fuel in the form of melting fat seeping into the victim's clothing. Fat contains a large amount of energy due to the presence of long hydrocarbon chains. It was thought that this was human spontaneous combustion, 'in supernatural phenomenon'.


== Examples ==


=== Mary Reeser case ===
Mary Reeser (1884–1951) of St. Petersburg, Florida was most likely a victim of the wick effect. It was suspected that she had accidentally ignited herself with a cigarette. The fat which over time had been absorbed by her clothing likely acted as fuel for the fire. At the scene, investigators found melted fat in the rug near Mary's body.


=== 1963 Leeds case ===
An investigation of a 1963 case in Leeds included an experiment with a wick effect. A small portion of human fat was wrapped in cloth to simulate clothing. A Bunsen burner flame was then applied to the 'candle'.  Due to the high water content of human fat the flame had to be held on the 'candle' for over a minute before it would catch fire:

""One end of the candle was ignited by a Bunsen flame, the fat catching fire after about a minute. Although the Bunsen was removed at this point, combustion of the fat proceeded slowly along the length of the roll, with a smoky yellow flame and much production of soot, the entire roll being consumed after about one hour.""

This gives some indication of the slow speed with which the wick effect will proceed.


=== 1991 Oregon murder ===
In February 1991, in woodland near Medford, Oregon, USA, two hikers came across the burning body of a female adult, lying face down in fallen leaves.  They alerted the officials and a local deputy sheriff soon arrived. She had been stabbed several times in the upper regions of the chest and back.  Both arms were spread outwards from the torso.   The lower legs and surface of the neck showed signs of fire damage.  The soft tissues of the right arm, torso and upper legs were consumed.  The majority of bones of these parts retained their integrity, although friability was increased. Between the victim's mid-chest and knees the fleshy parts of the body were mostly destroyed.  Crime scene personnel reported that the pelvis and spine were ""not recoverable"", having been reduced to a grey powder.  Her killer had soaked the clothes and corpse in nearly a pint of barbecue starter fluid and set her on fire.  In the well-oxygenated outdoor environment, this combination of circumstances—an immobile and clothed body with a high fat-to-muscle ratio, accelerant (lighter fluid), and artificial ignition—made it prime for the wick effect to occur.  The murderer was arrested and made a full confession.  He claimed to have set the body alight some 13 hours before it was discovered.


=== 1998 experiment ===
A larger scale experiment conducted for the BBC television programme Q.E.D. involved a dead pig's body being wrapped in a blanket and placed in a furnished room. The blanket was lit with the aid of a small amount of petrol. The body took some time to ignite and burned at a very high temperature with low flames. The heat collected at the top of the room and melted a television. However, the flames caused very little damage to the surroundings, and the body burned for a number of hours before it was extinguished and examined. On examination it was observed that the flesh and bones in the burnt portion had been destroyed.


=== 2006 Geneva case ===
In October 2006, the body of a man was discovered at home in Geneva, almost completely incinerated between the mid-chest and the knees, most probably due to heart attack while smoking, followed by the wick effect. The chair containing the body was mostly consumed, but other objects in the room were almost undamaged, albeit covered with a brown oily or greasy coating. The source of the fire was most likely a cigarette or cigar. The man's dog also died in another room of the man's apartment; this was attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning.


=== 2010 Galway case ===
In December 2010, the cremated body of a 76-year-old man was found alongside an open fireplace in his home in Clareview Park at Ballybane in the Irish city of Galway. The fire investigators concluded that no accelerants were used and that the open fireplace was not the cause of the fire. The coroner in the case could not identify the cause of the death due to extensive internal organ damage and concluded that ""this [case] fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation"".
The body of the man, Michael Faherty, was found in the living room of his home on 22 December 2010. The scene was searched by forensic experts from the Gardaí and the fire service, and a post-mortem was carried out by pathologist Grace Callagy. Callagy noted that Faherty had suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, but had not died from heart failure. Callagy concluded that the ""extensive nature of the burns sustained precludes determining the precise cause of death"". In September 2011, the west Galway coroner informed an inquiry into the death that he had searched medical literature, and referred to Professor Bernard Knight's book on forensic pathology, which states that a high number of alleged incidents of spontaneous human combustion had taken place near an open fireplace or chimney. Benjamin Radford, deputy editor of the science magazine Skeptical Inquirer, questioned why the coroner had ""conclusively ruled out"" other possible explanations.

LAMA2 related congenital muscular dystrophy,"LAMA2 muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD) is a genetically determined muscle disease caused by pathogenic mutations in the LAMA2 gene. It is a subtype of a larger group of genetic muscle diseases known collectively as congenital muscular dystrophies. The clinical presentation of LAMA2-MD varies according to the age at presentation. The severe forms present at birth and are known as early onset LAMA2 congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A or MDC1A.  The mild forms are known as late onset LAMA2 muscular dystrophy or late onset LAMA2-MD. The nomenclature LGMDR23 can be used interchangeably with late onset LAMA2-MD.
Suggestive clinical features include, muscular hyperlaxity or hypotonia, growth retardation progressive spine and joint contractures, and cardiac and respiratory failure.
For consensus, generally, the term congenital muscular dystrophy refers to a diverse group of childhood onset muscle diseases -usually occurring the first two years of life- and mostly inherited through an autosomal recessive mode. Congenital muscular dystrophies have known phenotype-genotype profiles and produce muscle degenerative pathology.


== Symptoms and signs ==

There are two types of LAMA2 muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD).  The first type is the congenital type known as early onset LAMA2 congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A or MDC1A. It presents at birth and has a relatively severe clinical presentation. Characteristically it manifests in muscle weakness, hyperlaxity or hypotonia, respiratory difficulties and developmental delay.    
The second type is the late onset LAMA2 muscular dystrophy or late onset LAMA2-MD. The age of presentation of late onset LAMA2-MD ranges from early childhood to adulthood. It usually has a mild clinical presentation in the form of progressive spine and joint contractures, and cardiac and respiratory failure.


=== Musculoskeletal manifestations ===
Delayed development of motor milestones as loss of ambulatory capacity is usually more severe in the congenital type 1A or MDC1A. Skeletal muscle weakness is a characteristic feature. It more evident in the proximal muscles of the extremities. Facial and neck weakness have also been reported. Scoliosis is a side curvature or abnormal deviation of the spine with an element of rotation. Scoliosis is usually rigid and progressive. It may be accompanied by lordosis.
The clinical orthopedic features of congenital type 1A (MDC1A) in terms of type, distribution, laterality, deformity progression, chronological order of muscle and joint involvement etc., have shown a fairly characteristic pattern. This is important to the differential diagnosis of LAMA2-MD and other subtypes of congenital muscular dystrophies among others. LAMA2-MD especially MDC1A, usually manifests in progressive contractures of large joints like knees, ankles, elbow and hips. Contractures tend to be bilateral. That is involving both the left and right sides. Observing the chronological order of development of joint contractures, namely early versus late in the disease course, could offer differential diagnostic clues for congenital muscular dystrophies as MDC1A, LMNA-Related muscular dystrophy among other genetic muscle diseases. Of note, any unique clinical orthopedic features of LAMA2-MD should be put into context with the other clinical features, characteristic brain and muscle imaging, muscle immunostaining and genetic testing findings. A study on a large series LAMA2-MD patients showed that bone mineral density was reduced in all adults and most children. Fragility fractures were reported occasionally.


=== Respiratory insufficiency ===
Respiratory insufficiency can occur in both types of LAMA2-MD. Respiratory tract infections are a cause of death in the congenital type 1A or MDC1A.


=== Cardiac manifestations ===
Cardiac involvement in LAMA2-MD may manifest in dilated cardiomyopathy and systolic dysfunction. Cardiac screening and surveillance are important in LAMA2-MD. This is aimed at timely diagnosis and management of subclinical cardiac involvement.


=== Cerebral manifestations ===
Epilepsy is a fairly common manifestation of both types of LAMA2-MD. However, the age at occurrence of first epileptic fit is earlier in the congenital type 1A or MDC1A. Screening for epilepsy should be included in the workup. Intelligence is usually normal. Epilepsy and intellectual disability were associated with motor dysfunction namely inability to sit and/or walk. Epilepsy and to a lesser extent intellectual disability were also strongly correlated to cortical abnormalities on brain MRI.     


== Cause ==
LAMA2-MD is caused by pathogenic variants or mutations in the LAMA2 gene that encodes  alpha2 chain of laminin-211 or laminin-alpha2, previously known as laminin type 2 or merosin.  laminin-211 is important to the function and integrity of the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. laminin-alpha2 is also present in extra-muscular locations as the central and peripheral nervous system. Pathogenic variants of the LAMA2 gene which lead to loss of function are accompanied by complete deficiency of laminin-alpha2 (merosin) and result in a severe clinical picture or phenotype namely early onset MDC1A. Pathogenic variants of the LAMA2 gene accompanied by partial deficiency of laminin-alpha2 result in a milder clinical picture namely late onset LAMA2 muscular dystrophy or late onset LAMA2-MD. The disease is inherited through an autosomal recessive mode.


== Diagnosis ==
Correlating the characteristic clinical picture with the specific imaging, laboratory and muscle biopsy findings is essential to the diagnosis of LAMA2-MD.  The presence of pathogenic variants in LAMA2 gene by Genetic testing, -DNA testing- of the affected individual confirms the diagnosis of LAMA2-MD.


=== Brain MRI ===

Abnormal white matter signals in Brain MRI is a near-universal sign in patients with LAMA2-MD. These white matter abnormalities appear as hyperintense signals on T2-weighted and FLAIR brain MRI images especially in locations that are originally myelinated in the immature brain as the periventricular area. Occasional MRI abnormalities include cortical malformations as polymicrogyria, lissencephaly, pachygyria. In LAMA2-MD there seems to be a directly proportional relationship between the magnitude of white mater and cortical abnormalities on brain MRI and the degree of motor dysfunction in terms of the ability to sit and walk. 


=== Whole body muscle MRI ===
Muscle MRI especially Whole-body muscle MRI can provide important diagnostic clues. Some studies have shown a reasonably characteristic pattern of muscle involvement on whole-body muscle MRI in LAMA2-MD patients. This relates to muscles or group of muscles involvement versus sparing. For example, sparing of the gracilis, sartorius muscles, and the adductor longus muscle  has been linked to LAMA2-MD. On the other hand, studies showed a specific predilection to involve the gluteus maximus and anterior thigh muscles, adductor magnus muscle, serratus anterior muscle  in LAMA2-MD, and so forth. Abnormal muscle texture or geometry on muscle MRI as presence of granular pattern of involvement in a muscle has been suggested to be a diagnostic clue. Similarly, a homogenous pattern of involvement of group of muscle e.g., anterior compartment of thigh, could be used to support diagnosis. Homogenous pattern refers to involvement of all individual muscles of a muscle compartment to the same extent. Moreover, Whole body muscle MRI could be indicative of clinical disease severity and duration of LAMA2-MD. It can also help establish phenotype genotype correlations
However, these muscle MRI features may overlap with other subtypes of congenital muscular dystrophy. Additionally, some inconsistencies between the above muscle imaging studies can be noted. Thus, more longitudinal studies with larger cohorts and standardized methodologies are needed to arrive at a more uniform and consistent muscle MRI signature in LAMA2-MD. It is therefore paramount to correlate muscle imaging findings with clinical, neuro-imaging, laboratory and genetic testing findings.


=== Muscle biopsy or immunostaining ===
There is an inversely proportional relationship between the quantity of laminin alpha2 (merosin) found on immunohistochemistry and disease severity.  That means, a more marked degree of laminin-alpha2 deficiency e.g., total or near-total deficiency, is associated with more pronounced muscle degenerative pathology as myofibrosis, necrosis and fiber size variation. This is also associated with a more severe clinical picture. A less marked degree of laminin-alpha2 (merosin) deficiency -residual staining- is associated with a less pronounced muscle degenerative pathology and a milder clinical picture. Generally, congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A or MDC1A is known to have a severer clinical picture than late onset LAMA2-MD. However, the degree of deficiency of laminin alpha2 (merosin) on immunohistochemistry in MDC1A can varies. Clinical disease severity associated with total laminin-alpha2 (merosin) deficiency usually manifests itself in early onset of symptoms, loss of ambulatory capacity and respiratory difficulties. 


== Treatment ==


=== Targeted therapies ===
 
There is no definite cure available for LAMA2-MD. However, preclinical studies on experimental animal models of Laminin alpha-2 chain deficient congenital muscular dystrophy are showing favorable yet early results. Generally, these preclinical studies are geared toward investigating the various factors behind disease initiation and progression, and exploration of potential ameliorating or curative therapies. Preclinical studies focus on combating substances that regulate and promote muscle fibrosis in the pathogenesis of LAMA2-MD e.g., TGF-β. This may reduce muscle fibrosis and enhance healthy muscle architecture subsequently. Alternatively, preclinical studies can be geared toward enhancing proteins that are involved in muscle regeneration. Laminin alpha2 (Laminin-211) and laminin-221 complex are an important molecule for muscle cell receptors namely integrin-α7β1 and α-dystroglycan. In LAMA2-CMD the laminin alpha2 deficiency results in malfunctioning or down regulation of integrin-α7β1 and α-dystroglycan. This disrupts the proper linkage between the basal lamina and muscle cell membrane. Consequently, the contractile mechanism is disrupted.  Integrin-α7β1 is important to satellite cell function, and myoblast adhesion and viability. Thusly, integrin-α7β1is an important contributor to skeletal muscle regeneration. Cell therapies that compensate for the deficiency or down regulation of integrin-α7β1 have the potential to delay or control the muscle degenerative process and preserve muscle architecture in LAMA2-CMD patients. Additionally, the use of laminin-111 treatment in experimental mouse models of LAMA2-CMD has showed satisfactory results in terms of increase in life expectancy muscle function and regeneration.


=== Supportive treatment ===
Currently, treatment is mainly supportive and palliative. It is directed at anticipating and preventing or alleviating the systemic complications associated disease progression. This refers to management of respiratory, cardiac, orthopedic and rehabilitative, central nervous system e.g., epilepsy, gastrointestinal and so forth.


== Prognosis ==

Prognosis is dependent on the subtype of LAMA2-MD. Nearly all children with early onset or congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) are unable to walk independently. Nevertheless, children with MDC1A are usually able to sit. Contrastingly, patients with late onset LAMA2-MD are usually able to walk independently.  Of note, in both types of LAMA2-MD developmental motor milestones are delayed.  
Additionally, the prognosis is dependent on the degree of surveillance and supportive care that patients receive in regard to the multisystem manifestations and potential complications of LAMA2-MD. This refers to prompt and timely management of orthopedic, cardiopulmonary, epilepsy and gastrointestinal systems among others. The multisystem manifestations may affect the quality of life of patients with LAMA2-MD.


== Epidemiology ==
It is estimated that congenital muscular dystrophies occur in between 0.563 per 100,000 (in Italy)  and 2.5 per 100,000 (in western Sweden). The prevalence data on congenital  muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) varies by geographic location or population. Example, in the United Kingdom MDC1A constituted about 37% of all congenital muscular dystrophy subtypes namely the most common subtype. In Qatar, MDC1A constituted 48% of congenital muscular dystrophy subtypes with estimated a point prevalence of 0.8 in 100.000 in a patient cohort from the Gulf and Middle East. Contrastingly, in Australia it constituted 16% of all congenital muscular dystrophy subtypes namely the third most common subtype. A scoping review on clinical orthopedic manifestations of congenital  muscular dystrophy subtypes reported that the most common subtype was MDC1A accounting for 37% of the total study sample.

Tenrikyo theology,"Tenrikyo theology (天理教学 Tenrikyōgaku) is the theology of the Tenrikyo religion. The discipline of Tenrikyo theology consists of scriptural studies (studies of the Ofudesaki, Mikagura-uta, and Osashizu), historical theology, dogmatic theology, and practical theology.


== Scripture ==


== God ==


=== Names ===

In historical documents and scriptures related to Tenrikyo, a number of different appellations are ascribed to God.
In the Ofudesaki, God identified as three different entities. In 1869, when the first verses were composed, God initially identified as kami (神), a spirit in the Japanese Shinto tradition. The designation kami was broader than the Abrahamic notion of God, as it could be applied to any object that possessed divine power or inspired awe, such as animals, trees, places, and people. However, the Ofudesaki stressed the uniqueness of the kami by adding various qualifiers such as moto no kami (God of origin), shinjitsu no kami (God of truth), and kono yō o hajimeta kami (God who began this world). From 1874, God began to identify as tsukihi (月日), or moon-sun, and from 1879, God began to identify as oya (をや), or parent, though kami and tsukihi continued to be used until the last part of the scripture.
In Tenrikyo's creation story, outlined in the Ofudesaki and elaborated upon in various notes on her talks known collectively as kōki, there are ten figures credited with the creation of human beings. Some Tenrikyo authorities suggest that two of these figures, Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto and Omotari-no-Mikoto, represent tsukihi, or more precisely the duality tsuki-sama and hi-sama. The other eight figures are tools subordinate to tsukihi that were drawn in, consulted, and trained in the creation of human beings.
In the Mikagura-uta, the songs of Tenrikyo's liturgy, God is commonly referred to as kami. At the end of most of the songs, God is invoked with the name Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto, (てんりおうのみこと or 天理王命) or ""absolute ruler of divine reason.""
The historical sources written during Nakayama Miki's lifetime and in the years following her death suggest a number of other appellations of God. In Nakayama Shinnosuke's Oyasama gyoden, the source on which The Life of Oyasama is primarily based, Miki refers to God as ten no shōgun (Shōgun of Heaven) in the initial revelation. In early attempts to obtain religious sanctions from the Yoshida Administrative Office of Shinto and a Shingon Buddhist temple, the name of God was recorded as Tenrin-Ō-Myōjin (天輪王明神) and Tenrin-Ō-Kōsha (転輪王講社) respectively. An early doctrine of the Tenrikyo church, written to conform to the State Shinto doctrine at the time, records the name as Tenri-Ōkami.
Tenrikyo's current doctrine maintains that Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto is the divine name to be used in the context of prayer. The doctrine frequently refers to God as God the Parent (親神様 oyagamisama), emphasizing the parental nature of God revealed toward the end of the Ofudesaki. The doctrine claims that the changes in God's names in the Ofudesaki, from kami to tsukihi to oya, were made in accordance with the spiritual growth of the early followers.


=== Attributes ===
The Ofudesaki verses name jūyō or jūyōjizai, translated as ""omnipotence"" or ""free and unlimited workings,"" as a significant attribute of God. This omnipotence governs not only the order of the universe, but also events in the natural world, such as rainstorms and earthquakes, and in one's personal life, such as dreams and diseases. This omnipotence works through those people who believe as well as those who do not.

=== Causality ===


==== Comparison to karmic belief ====

The concept of ""causality"" (innen いんねん) in Tenrikyo is a unique understanding of karmic belief. Though causality resembles karmic beliefs found in religious traditions originating in ancient India, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, Tenrikyo's doctrine does not claim to inherit the concept from these traditions and differs from their explanations of karma in a few significant ways.
Broadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). In other words, a person's good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering. Causality and karma are interchangeable in this sense; throughout life a person may experience good and bad causality. In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, ""every seed sown will sprout."" Karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth, such that one's past deeds in the current life and in all previous lives are reflected in the present moment, and one's present deeds are reflected in the future of the current life and in all future lives. This understanding of rebirth is upheld in causality as well.
Tenrikyo's ontology, however, differs from older karmic religious traditions such as Buddhism. In Tenrikyo, the human person is believed to consist of mind, body, and soul. The mind, which is given the freedom to sense, feel, and act by God the Parent, ceases to function at death. On the other hand, the soul, through the process of denaoshi (出直し, ""to make a fresh start""), takes on a new body lent from God the Parent and is reborn into this world. Though the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person's thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person's causality. As can be seen, Tenrikyo's ontology, which rests on the existence on a single creator deity (God the Parent), differs from Buddhist ontology, which does not contain a creator deity. Also Tenrikyo's concept of salvation, which is to live the Joyous Life in this existence and therefore does not promise a liberated afterlife outside of this existence, differs from Buddhist concepts of saṃsāra and nirvana.


==== Original causality ====
At the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of original causality, or causality of origin (moto no innen もとのいんねん), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a teleological element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.


==== Individual causality ====
Belief in individual causality is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.
Tenrikyo's doctrine explains that an individual's suffering should not be perceived as punishment or retributive justice from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as a sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of tanno (たんのう ""joyous acceptance"" in Tenrikyo gloss), a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. Tanno is a way of settling the mind – it is not to merely resign oneself to one's situation, but rather to actively “recognize God’s parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.” In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.


==== Three casualties ====
In addition, The Doctrine of Tenrikyo names three casualties (san innen さんいんねん) that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo's teachings. More precisely, these casualties are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that ""when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity."" The ""Causality of the Soul of Oyasama"" denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (Izanami-no-Mikoto), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The ""Causality of the Residence"" means that the Nakayama Residence, where Tenrikyo Church Headquarters stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The ""Causality of the Promised Time"" indicates that October 26, 1838 – the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama – marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.


== Creation narrative ==

The creation narrative of Tenrikyo, which followers refer to as the ""Truth of Origin"" (元の理 moto no ri), explains Nakayama Miki's understanding of how God created the first prototypes of human beings and developed them over many years.
The creation narrative first appeared in writing in 1874, when Nakayama Miki composed Part III of the Ofudesaki. The narrative was described in more detail in Part VI and continued to be explained in fragments in the parts thereafter.
However, Miki also conveyed the narrative as part of talks she would deliver to her disciples regarding her teachings. She had her disciples write down what they remembered of her talks and submit them to her for her approval. In the end she never approved any of the manuscripts, so her followers did not regard them as canonical in the same way as the scriptures – namely the Ofudesaki, Mikagura-uta, and Osashizu. The manuscripts that have survived are collectively referred to as kōki (こふき).
In the latter half of the twentieth century, scholars began to publish interpretations of the creation narrative based on various disciplines such as ethnology, cosmology, philosophy, comparative mythology, psychology, and biology.

== History ==
A year after the death of Tenrikyo founder Nakayama Miki in 1887, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters was established as a legally recognized religious organization under the Shinto Main Bureau (神道本局 Shinto Honkyoku). In 1900, Tenrikyo founded its first institute for doctrinal studies, Tenri Seminary. In 1903, an early edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was completed, known today as the ""Meiji doctrine"" since it was written during the Meiji period. This edition of the doctrine differed significantly from the present edition because the scholars who completed this edition were not strictly Tenrikyo scholars but scholars of religion (Nakanishi Ushirō) and scholars of Shinto (Inoue Yorikuni, Itsumi Chūzaburō) invited from outside the Tenrikyo circle.
In 1925, Nakayama Shozen, Nakayama Miki's great-grandson, became the second Shinbashira (spiritual and administrative leader) of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters and founded the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials. From 1925 to 1938, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials began to compile the sources which would form the basis of Tenrikyo's scriptures and supplements to the scriptures.
During this period, several Tenrikyo students attended university and majored in religious studies. These would become some of Tenrikyo's first theologians. One such student was Nakayama Shozen, who from 1926 to 1929 studied the history of religion at Tokyo Imperial University under Masaharu Anesaki. In the following decade, others would major in religious studies at Tokyo Imperial University, such as Ueda Yoshinaru (1931), Nakayama Yoshikazu (1932), Nagao Hiroumi (1935), and Moroi Yoshinori (1938). Fukaya Tadamasa was studying Western history, with a focus on history of Christian theology, at Kyoto Imperial University.
In the several years following World War II, further research and institutional development allowed for the emergence of Tenrikyo theology. In 1946, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials began to publish its findings in the periodical Fukugen ('Restoration'). The Doctrine of Tenrikyo, which systematically summarizes Tenrikyo's beliefs and practices, was published in 1949. In the same year, Tenri University was founded.
Tenrikyo theology as a collective academic effort began with the first issue of Tenrikyōgaku kenkyū (Studies on Tenrikyo theology) published in 1950. This issue opened with an essay by Moroi Yoshinori titled Tenrikyō shingaku joshō (Introduction to Tenrikyo theology), which outlines what he believed to be the contents and the goals of Tenrikyo theology.
Modern Christian theology and existentialism have had a significant influence in the early development of Tenrikyo theology. Early Tenrikyo scholars expressed interest in the thought of Søren Kierkegaard, Karl Jaspers, and Gabriel Marcel, and recommended that their students study Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics.


== Theologians ==


=== Moroi Yoshinori ===
Moroi Yoshinori (諸井慶徳 1915–1961) first studied philosophy of religion at Tokyo Imperial University, writing his undergraduate thesis on Max Scheler. Moroi did his doctoral work at the same university, receiving his Doctor of Literature degree from the University of Tokyo in 1961, the day before he died. One of his most notable works of academic research is his doctoral dissertation, Shūkyō shinpishugi hassei no kenkyū: toku ni Semu-kei chōetsushinkyō o chūshin to suru shūkyō gakuteki kōsatsu (""A study of the development of religious mysticism: A religious-studies perspective centering on Semitic monotheism""), which was posthumously published by Tenri University in 1966. Another notable work, Shūkyōteki shutaisei no ronri (""The logic of religious identity""), was left unfinished at his death, but it was completed by younger Tenrikyo scholars and eventually published in 1991.
Among his works pertaining to Tenrikyo theology are the aforementioned Tenrikyō shingaku joshō and Tenrikyō kyōgigaku shiron (""A preliminary essay on Tenrikyo dogmatic theology""). Many of his works were compiled and published in Moroi Yoshinori chōsakushū (""Collection of Yoshinori Moroi's Works"").


=== Fukaya Tadamasa ===
Fukaya Tadamasa (深谷忠政 1912–2007) studied the history of Christian theology at Kyoto Imperial University. Throughout his life he held important positions in Tenrikyo Church Headquarters, serving at various points as president of Tenrikyo Doyusha, professor at Tenri University, bishop of Tenrikyo's diocese in North America, and honbu-in (Church Headquarters executive staff member).
His important theological works include Tenrikyō – dame no oshie (""Tenrikyo – the ultimate teaching"") and Tenrikyō kyōgigaku josetsu (""Prolegomena to Tenrikyo dogmatics"").  He wrote a number of books which have since been translated into English by the Tenrikyo Overseas Department, such as a Mikagura-uta commentary (A Commentary on the Mikagura-uta) and a study on Tenrikyo's creation narrative (A Doctrinal Study: The Truth of Origin).


=== Other theologians ===
Tenrikyo theologians have focused on subfields of study within Tenrikyo theology. Scriptural studies is based on contributions of Nakayama Shozen, Moroi Yoshinori, and Fukaya Tadamasa, and more recent contributors to this subfield include Nakajima Hideo, Yamamoto Kunio, Serizawa Shigeru, and Sawai Yuichi. Research on Tenrikyo's relationship to contemporary thought has been done by Iida Teruaki. Research on Tenrikyo missiology has been conducted by Shionoya Satoshi. Historical research on Tenrikyo has been contributed by Ishizaki Masao and Ihashi Fusato. Connections between Tenrikyo and religious studies have been researched by Matsunoto Shigeru, Miyata Gen, and Hashimoto Taketo.

Pterocarpus santalinus,"Pterocarpus santalinus, with the common names red sanders, red saunders, Yerra Chandanam, Chenchandanam, red sandalwood, Rakta Chandana, and rakto chandon, is a species of Pterocarpus endemic to the southern Eastern Ghats mountain range of South India. This tree is valued for the rich red colour of its wood, and in recent years there has been a marked uptick in the use of red sandalwood as a component of incense, especially in the west. The tree is not to be confused with the aromatic Santalum sandalwood trees that grow natively in Southern India.


== Description ==

Pterocarpus santalinus is a light-demanding small tree, growing to 8 metres (26 ft) tall with a trunk 50–150 cm diameter. It is fast-growing when young, reaching 5 metres (16 ft) tall in three years, even on degraded soils. It is not frost tolerant, being killed by temperatures of −1 °C.
The leaves are alternate, 3–9 cm long, trifoliate with three leaflets.
The flowers are produced in short racemes. The fruit is a pod 6–9 cm long containing one or two seeds.


== Uses ==


=== Timber ===

The wood has historically been valued in China, particularly during the Qing dynasty periods, and is referred to in Chinese as zitan (紫檀) and spelt tzu-t'an by earlier western authors such as Gustav Ecke, who introduced classical Chinese hardwood furniture to the west. An exquisite chair made of red sandalwood can be seen today in China's Forbidden City in Beijing, inside the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and once used by the emperors of the Qing dynasty.
Due to its slow growth and rarity, furniture made from zitan is difficult to find and can be expensive. It has been one of the most prized woods for millennia.
In India red sandalwood is one main and lucrative market for smugglers, as a high price is paid for this wood in China. Since the exporting of sandalwood is illegal in India, the underground market is growing and there are a number of arrests every year of those trying to smuggle this wood to China.
The other form of zitan is from the species Dalbergia louvelii, Dalbergia maritima, and Dalbergia normandii, all similar species named in trade as bois de rose or violet rosewood which when cut are bright crimson purple changing to dark purple again. It has a fragrant scent when worked.


=== Shamisen ===
Red sandalwood has been used for making the bridge and also the neck of the Japanese musical instrument shamisen. The heartwood is preferred for this purpose.


=== Medicinal values ===
Pterocarpus santalinus is used in traditional herbal medicine as an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic, tonic, hemorrhage, dysentery, aphrodisiac, anti-hyperglycaemic and diaphoretic.


=== Grading of red sandalwood ===
Red sandalwood grown on the shale subsoils, at altitudes around 750 metres (2,460 ft), and in semi-arid climatic conditions gives a distinctive wavy grain margin. Lumber pieces with the wavy grain margin are graded as ""A"" grade. Red sandalwood with wavy grain margins sells at higher prices than the standard wood.


== Conservation status ==
Pterocarpus santalinus was listed as an Endangered species by the IUCN, because of overexploitation for its timber in South India; however, it was later reclassified to Near Threatened in 2018, as the scale of this loss is not properly known.
It is also listed in the appendix II of the CITES, which means that a certificate is required in order to export it, that should only be granted if the trade is not detrimental to the survival of the species.

Luggage label,"A luggage label,  luggage sticker, baggage sticker or baggage label is an adhesive label placed over a traveler's luggage for identification purposes.  Usually issued by hotels, restaurants, railways and cruise companies, they became popular between the mid-19th century and the early 20th century, in the so-called Golden Age of Travel, with the popularization of mass tourism and the development of railroads, ocean liners and eventually of air travel.
Aside their utilitary purpose, luggage labels were also a form of advertisement, sporting elaborate designs; after the latter half of the 20th century, their use dwindled, becoming vintage collection items since then.


== Forerunner ==
The Romans used baggage labels made from lead.

Port scanner,"A port scanner is a software tool that checks which ports are open on a network host.
This is often used by network administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to find network services running on a host to take advantage of vulnerabilities.",0
Resort town,"A resort town or resort city is an urban area where tourism generates income for most of the people who live there. Such a city usually has one or more actual resorts around it. Sometimes the term is used to refer to a place that is popular with tourists. 
The first such cities were created in the early 19th century.",0
Photosphere,A photosphere is a layer of stars from which light is radiated. It is the deepest region of a star that is transparent to photons of certain wavelengths.,0
Closed source,"Closed source (or proprietary software) means computer programs whose source code is not published.  The source code is not shared with the public for anyone to look at or change.  Closed source is the opposite of open source. 
Most companies who sell their software for money make it closed source so people cannot easily change it or copy it for free. 
Even some who give their software for free do not show the source code, because they think it looks bad, or that somebody will change the authors' names to their own (a kind of plagiarism) without making the program better.  Some programs called “freeware” are given away for free, but they are not the same as free software that anyone can change any way they please.",0
Computer program,"A computer program is a sequence or set of instructions in a programming language for a computer to execute. It is one component of software, which also includes documentation and other intangible components.
A computer program in its human-readable form is called source code. Source code needs another computer program to execute because computers can only execute their native machine instructions. Therefore, source code may be translated to machine instructions using a compiler written for the language. (Assembly language programs are translated using an assembler.) The resulting file is called an executable. Alternatively, source code may execute within an interpreter written for the language.
If the executable is requested for execution, then the operating system loads it into memory and starts a process. The central processing unit will soon switch to this process so it can fetch, decode, and then execute each machine instruction.
If the source code is requested for execution, then the operating system loads the corresponding interpreter into memory and starts a process. The interpreter then loads the source code into memory to translate and execute each statement. Running the source code is slower than running an executable. Moreover, the interpreter must be installed on the computer.


== Example computer program ==
The ""Hello, World!"" program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. The syntax of the language BASIC (1964) was intentionally limited to make the language easy to learn. For example, variables are not declared before being used. Also, variables are automatically initialized to zero. Here is an example computer program, in Basic, to average a list of numbers:

Once the mechanics of basic computer programming are learned, more sophisticated and powerful languages are available to build large computer systems.


== History ==

Improvements in software development are the result of improvements in computer hardware. At each stage in hardware's history, the task of computer programming changed dramatically.


=== Analytical Engine ===

In 1837, Jacquard's loom inspired Charles Babbage to attempt to build the Analytical Engine.
The names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry. In the textile industry, yarn was brought from the store to be milled. The device had a store which consisted of memory to hold 1,000 numbers of 50 decimal digits each. Numbers from the store were transferred to the mill for processing. It was programmed using two sets of perforated cards. One set directed the operation and the other set inputted the variables. However, the thousands of cogged wheels and gears never fully worked together.
Ada Lovelace worked for Charles Babbage to create a description of the Analytical Engine (1843). The description contained Note G which completely detailed a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine. This note is recognized by some historians as the world's first computer program.


=== Universal Turing machine ===

In 1936, Alan Turing introduced the Universal Turing machine, a theoretical device that can model every computation.
It is a finite-state machine that has an infinitely long read/write tape. The machine can move the tape back and forth, changing its contents as it performs an algorithm. The machine starts in the initial state, goes through a sequence of steps, and halts when it encounters the halt state. All present-day computers are Turing complete.


=== ENIAC ===

The Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC) was built between July 1943 and Fall 1945. It was a Turing complete, general-purpose computer that used 17,468 vacuum tubes to create the circuits. At its core, it was a series of Pascalines wired together. Its 40 units weighed 30 tons, occupied 1,800 square feet (167 m2), and consumed $650 per hour (in 1940s currency) in electricity when idle. It had 20 base-10 accumulators. Programming the ENIAC took up to two months. Three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels. Function tables were connected to function panels by plugging heavy black cables into plugboards. Each function table had 728 rotating knobs. Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. Debugging a program took a week. It ran from 1947 until 1955 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns.


=== Stored-program computers ===
Instead of plugging in cords and turning switches, a stored-program computer loads its instructions into memory just like it loads its data into memory. As a result, the computer could be programmed quickly and perform calculations at very fast speeds. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the ENIAC. The two engineers introduced the stored-program concept in a three-page memo dated February 1944. Later, in September 1944, John von Neumann began working on the ENIAC project. On June 30, 1945, von Neumann published the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, which equated the structures of the computer with the structures of the human brain. The design became known as the von Neumann architecture. The architecture was simultaneously deployed in the constructions of the EDVAC and EDSAC computers in 1949.
The IBM System/360 (1964) was a family of computers, each having the same instruction set architecture. The Model 20 was the smallest and least expensive. Customers could upgrade and retain the same application software. The Model 195 was the most premium.  Each System/360 model featured multiprogramming—having multiple processes in memory at once. When one process was waiting for input/output, another could compute.
IBM planned for each model to be programmed using PL/1. A committee was formed that included COBOL, Fortran and ALGOL programmers. The purpose was to develop a language that was comprehensive, easy to use, extendible, and would replace Cobol and Fortran. The result was a large and complex language that took a long time to compile.

Computers manufactured until the 1970s had front-panel switches for manual programming. The computer program was written on paper for reference. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also were automatically inputted via paper tape, punched cards or magnetic-tape. After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches, and the execute button was pressed.


=== Very Large Scale Integration ===

A major milestone in software development was the invention of the Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuit (1964). Following World War II, tube-based technology was replaced with point-contact transistors (1947) and bipolar junction transistors (late 1950s) mounted on a circuit board. During the 1960s, the aerospace industry replaced the circuit board with an integrated circuit chip.
Robert Noyce, co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor (1957) and Intel (1968), achieved a technological improvement to refine the production of field-effect transistors (1963). The goal is to alter the electrical resistivity and conductivity of a semiconductor junction. First, naturally occurring silicate minerals are converted into polysilicon rods using the Siemens process. The Czochralski process then converts the rods into a monocrystalline silicon, boule crystal. The crystal is then thinly sliced to form a wafer substrate. The planar process of photolithography then integrates unipolar transistors, capacitors, diodes, and resistors onto the wafer to build a matrix of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistors. The MOS transistor is the primary component in integrated circuit chips.
Originally, integrated circuit chips had their function set during manufacturing. During the 1960s, controlling the electrical flow migrated to programming a matrix of read-only memory (ROM). The matrix resembled a two-dimensional array of fuses. The process to embed instructions onto the matrix was to burn out the unneeded connections. There were so many connections, firmware programmers wrote a computer program on another chip to oversee the burning. The technology became known as Programmable ROM. In 1971, Intel installed the computer program onto the chip and named it the Intel 4004 microprocessor.

The terms microprocessor and central processing unit (CPU) are now used interchangeably. However, CPUs predate microprocessors. For example, the IBM System/360 (1964) had a CPU made from circuit boards containing discrete components on ceramic substrates.


=== Sac State 8008 ===

The Intel 4004 (1971) was a 4-bit microprocessor designed to run the Busicom calculator. Five months after its release, Intel released the Intel 8008, an 8-bit microprocessor. Bill Pentz led a team at Sacramento State to build the first microcomputer using the Intel 8008: the Sac State 8008 (1972). Its purpose was to store patient medical records. The computer supported a disk operating system to run a Memorex, 3-megabyte, hard disk drive. It had a color display and keyboard that was packaged in a single console. The disk operating system was programmed using IBM's Basic Assembly Language (BAL). The medical records application was programmed using a BASIC interpreter. However, the computer was an evolutionary dead-end because it was extremely expensive. Also, it was built at a public university lab for a specific purpose. Nonetheless, the project contributed to the development of the Intel 8080 (1974) instruction set.


=== x86 series ===

In 1978, the modern software development environment began when Intel upgraded the Intel 8080 to the Intel 8086. Intel simplified the Intel 8086 to manufacture the cheaper Intel 8088. IBM embraced the Intel 8088 when they entered the personal computer market (1981). As consumer demand for personal computers increased, so did Intel's microprocessor development. The succession of development is known as the x86 series. The x86 assembly language is a family of backward-compatible machine instructions. Machine instructions created in earlier microprocessors were retained throughout microprocessor upgrades. This enabled consumers to purchase new computers without having to purchase new application software.  The major categories of instructions are:

Memory instructions to set and access numbers and strings in random-access memory.
Integer arithmetic logic unit (ALU) instructions to perform the primary arithmetic operations on integers.
Floating point ALU instructions to perform the primary arithmetic operations on real numbers.
Call stack instructions to push and pop words needed to allocate memory and interface with functions.
Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instructions to increase speed when multiple processors are available to perform the same algorithm on an array of data.


=== Changing programming environment ===

VLSI circuits enabled the programming environment to advance from a computer terminal (until the 1990s) to a graphical user interface (GUI) computer. Computer terminals limited programmers to a single shell running in a command-line environment. During the 1970s, full-screen source code editing became possible through a text-based user interface. Regardless of the technology available, the goal is to program in a programming language.


== Programming paradigms and languages ==
Programming language features exist to provide building blocks to be combined to express programming ideals. Ideally, a programming language should:

express ideas directly in the code.
express independent ideas independently.
express relationships among ideas directly in the code.
combine ideas freely.
combine ideas only where combinations make sense.
express simple ideas simply.
The programming style of a programming language to provide these building blocks may be categorized into programming paradigms. For example, different paradigms may differentiate:

procedural languages, functional languages, and logical languages.
different levels of data abstraction.
different levels of class hierarchy.
different levels of input datatypes, as in container types and generic programming.
Each of these programming styles has contributed to the synthesis of different programming languages.
A programming language is a set of keywords, symbols, identifiers, and rules by which programmers can communicate instructions to the computer. They follow a set of rules called a syntax.

Keywords are reserved words to form declarations and statements.
Symbols are characters to form operations, assignments, control flow, and delimiters.
Identifiers are words created by programmers to form constants, variable names, structure names, and function names.
Syntax Rules are defined in the Backus–Naur form.
Programming languages get their basis from formal languages. The purpose of defining a solution in terms of its formal language is to generate an algorithm to solve the underlining problem. An algorithm is a sequence of simple instructions that solve a problem.


=== Generations of programming language ===

The evolution of programming languages began when the EDSAC (1949) used the first stored computer program in its von Neumann architecture. Programming the EDSAC was in the first generation of programming language.

The first generation of programming language is machine language. Machine language requires the programmer to enter instructions using instruction numbers called machine code. For example, the ADD operation on the PDP-11 has instruction number 24576.
The second generation of programming language is assembly language. Assembly language allows the programmer to use mnemonic instructions instead of remembering instruction numbers. An assembler translates each assembly language mnemonic into its machine language number. For example, on the PDP-11, the operation 24576 can be referenced as ADD in the source code. The four basic arithmetic operations have assembly instructions like ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV. Computers also have instructions like DW (Define Word) to reserve memory cells. Then the MOV instruction can copy integers between registers and memory.
The basic structure of an assembly language statement is a label, operation, operand, and comment.
Labels allow the programmer to work with variable names. The assembler will later translate labels into physical memory addresses.
Operations allow the programmer to work with mnemonics. The assembler will later translate mnemonics into instruction numbers.
Operands tell the assembler which data the operation will process.
Comments allow the programmer to articulate a narrative because the instructions alone are vague.
The key characteristic of an assembly language program is it forms a one-to-one mapping to its corresponding machine language target.
The third generation of programming language uses compilers and interpreters to execute computer programs. The distinguishing feature of a third generation language is its independence from particular hardware. Early languages include Fortran (1958), COBOL (1959), ALGOL (1960), and BASIC (1964). In 1973, the C programming language emerged as a high-level language that produced efficient machine language instructions. Whereas third-generation languages historically generated many machine instructions for each statement, C has statements that may generate a single machine instruction. Moreover, an optimizing compiler might overrule the programmer and produce fewer machine instructions than statements. Today, an entire paradigm of languages fill the imperative, third generation spectrum.
The fourth generation of programming language emphasizes what output results are desired, rather than how programming statements should be constructed. Declarative languages attempt to limit side effects and allow programmers to write code with relatively few errors. One popular fourth generation language is called Structured Query Language (SQL). Database developers no longer need to process each database record one at a time. Also, a simple statement can generate output records without having to understand how they are retrieved.


=== Imperative languages ===

Imperative languages specify a sequential algorithm using declarations, expressions, and statements:

A declaration introduces a variable name to the computer program and assigns it to a datatype – for example: var x: integer;
An expression yields a value – for example: 2 + 2 yields 4
A statement might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's control flow – for example: x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();


==== Fortran ====
FORTRAN (1958) was unveiled as ""The IBM Mathematical FORmula TRANslating system"". It was designed for scientific calculations, without string handling facilities. Along with declarations, expressions, and statements, it supported:

arrays.
subroutines.
""do"" loops.
It succeeded because:

programming and debugging costs were below computer running costs.
it was supported by IBM.
applications at the time were scientific.
However, non-IBM vendors also wrote Fortran compilers, but with a syntax that would likely fail IBM's compiler. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed the first Fortran standard in 1966. In 1978, Fortran 77 became the standard until 1991. Fortran 90 supports:

records.
pointers to arrays.


==== COBOL ====
COBOL (1959) stands for ""COmmon Business Oriented Language"". Fortran manipulated symbols. It was soon realized that symbols did not need to be numbers, so strings were introduced. The US Department of Defense influenced COBOL's development, with Grace Hopper being a major contributor. The statements were English-like and verbose. The goal was to design a language so managers could read the programs. However, the lack of structured statements hindered this goal.
COBOL's development was tightly controlled, so dialects did not emerge to require ANSI standards. As a consequence, it was not changed for 15 years until 1974. The 1990s version did make consequential changes, like object-oriented programming.


==== Algol ====
ALGOL (1960) stands for ""ALGOrithmic Language"". It had a profound influence on programming language design. Emerging from a committee of European and American programming language experts, it used standard mathematical notation and had a readable, structured design. Algol was first to define its syntax using the Backus–Naur form. This led to syntax-directed compilers. It added features like:

block structure, where variables were local to their block.
arrays with variable bounds.
""for"" loops.
functions.
recursion.
Algol's direct descendants include Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, Delphi and Oberon on one branch. On another branch the descendants include C, C++ and Java.


==== Basic ====
BASIC (1964) stands for ""Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code"". It was developed at Dartmouth College for all of their students to learn. If a student did not go on to a more powerful language, the student would still remember Basic. A Basic interpreter was installed in the microcomputers manufactured in the late 1970s. As the microcomputer industry grew, so did the language.
Basic pioneered the interactive session. It offered operating system commands within its environment:

The 'new' command created an empty slate.
Statements evaluated immediately.
Statements could be programmed by preceding them with line numbers.
The 'list' command displayed the program.
The 'run' command executed the program.
However, the Basic syntax was too simple for large programs. Recent dialects added structure and object-oriented extensions. Microsoft's Visual Basic is still widely used and produces a graphical user interface.


==== C ====
C programming language (1973) got its name because the language BCPL was replaced with B, and AT&T Bell Labs called the next version ""C"". Its purpose was to write the UNIX operating system. C is a relatively small language, making it easy to write compilers. Its growth mirrored the hardware growth in the 1980s. Its growth also was because it has the facilities of assembly language, but uses a high-level syntax. It added advanced features like:

inline assembler.
arithmetic on pointers.
pointers to functions.
bit operations.
freely combining complex operators.

C allows the programmer to control which region of memory data is to be stored. Global variables and static variables require the fewest clock cycles to store. The stack is automatically used for the standard variable declarations. Heap memory is returned to a pointer variable from the malloc() function.

The global and static data region is located just above the program region. (The program region is technically called the text region. It is where machine instructions are stored.)
The global and static data region is technically two regions. One region is called the initialized data segment, where variables declared with default values are stored. The other region is called the block started by segment, where variables declared without default values are stored.
Variables stored in the global and static data region have their addresses set at compile-time. They retain their values throughout the life of the process.
The global and static region stores the global variables that are declared on top of (outside) the main() function. Global variables are visible to main() and every other function in the source code.
On the other hand, variable declarations inside of main(), other functions, or within { } block delimiters are local variables. Local variables also include formal parameter variables. Parameter variables are enclosed within the parenthesis of a function definition. Parameters provide an interface to the function.
Local variables declared using the static prefix are also stored in the global and static data region. Unlike global variables, static variables are only visible within the function or block. Static variables always retain their value. An example usage would be the function int increment_counter(){static int counter = 0; counter++; return counter;}
The stack region is a contiguous block of memory located near the top memory address. Variables placed in the stack are populated from top to bottom. A stack pointer is a special-purpose register that keeps track of the last memory address populated. Variables are placed into the stack via the assembly language PUSH instruction. Therefore, the addresses of these variables are set during runtime. The method for stack variables to lose their scope is via the POP instruction.
Local variables declared without the static prefix, including formal parameter variables, are called automatic variables and are stored in the stack. They are visible inside the function or block and lose their scope upon exiting the function or block.
The heap region is located below the stack. It is populated from the bottom to the top. The operating system manages the heap using a heap pointer and a list of allocated memory blocks. Like the stack, the addresses of heap variables are set during runtime. An out of memory error occurs when the heap pointer and the stack pointer meet.
C provides the malloc() library function to allocate heap memory. Populating the heap with data is an additional copy function. Variables stored in the heap are economically passed to functions using pointers. Without pointers, the entire block of data would have to be passed to the function via the stack.


==== C++ ====
In the 1970s, software engineers needed language support to break large projects down into modules. One obvious feature was to decompose large projects physically into separate files. A less obvious feature was to decompose large projects logically into abstract data types. At the time, languages supported concrete (scalar) datatypes like integer numbers, floating-point numbers, and strings of characters. Abstract datatypes are structures of concrete datatypes, with a new name assigned. For example, a list of integers could be called integer_list.
In object-oriented jargon, abstract datatypes are called classes. However, a class is only a definition; no memory is allocated. When memory is allocated to a class and bound to an identifier, it is called an object.
Object-oriented imperative languages developed by combining the need for classes and the need for safe functional programming. A function, in an object-oriented language, is assigned to a class. An assigned function is then referred to as a method, member function, or operation. Object-oriented programming is executing operations on objects.
Object-oriented languages support a syntax to model subset/superset relationships. In set theory, an element of a subset inherits all the attributes contained in the superset. For example, a student is a person. Therefore, the set of students is a subset of the set of persons. As a result, students inherit all the attributes common to all persons. Additionally, students have unique attributes that other people do not have. Object-oriented languages model subset/superset relationships using inheritance. Object-oriented programming became the dominant language paradigm by the late 1990s.
C++ (1985) was originally called ""C with Classes"". It was designed to expand C's capabilities by adding the object-oriented facilities of the language Simula.
An object-oriented module is composed of two files. The definitions file is called the header file. Here is a C++ header file for the GRADE class in a simple school application:

A constructor operation is a function with the same name as the class name. It is executed when the calling operation executes the new statement.
A module's other file is the source file. Here is a C++ source file for the GRADE class in a simple school application:

=== Declarative languages ===

Imperative languages have one major criticism: assigning an expression to a non-local variable may produce an unintended side effect. Declarative languages generally omit the assignment statement and the control flow. They describe what computation should be performed and not how to compute it. Two broad categories of declarative languages are functional languages and logical languages.
The principle behind a functional language is to use lambda calculus as a guide for a well defined semantic. In mathematics, a function is a rule that maps elements from an expression to a range of values. Consider the function:
times_10(x) = 10 * x
The expression 10 * x is mapped by the function times_10() to a range of values. One value happens to be 20. This occurs when x is 2. So, the application of the function is mathematically written as:
times_10(2) = 20
A functional language compiler will not store this value in a variable. Instead, it will push the value onto the computer's stack before setting the program counter back to the calling function. The calling function will then pop the value from the stack.
Imperative languages do support functions. Therefore, functional programming can be achieved in an imperative language, if the programmer uses discipline. However, a functional language will force this discipline onto the programmer through its syntax. Functional languages have a syntax tailored to emphasize the what.
A functional program is developed with a set of primitive functions followed by a single driver function. Consider the snippet:
function max( a, b ){/* code omitted */}
function min( a, b ){/* code omitted */}
function range( a, b, c ) {

return max( a, max( b, c ) ) - min( a, min( b, c ) );
}
The primitives are max() and min(). The driver function is range(). Executing:
put( range( 10, 4, 7) ); will output 6.
Functional languages are used in computer science research to explore new language features. Moreover, their lack of side-effects have made them popular in parallel programming and concurrent programming. However, application developers prefer the object-oriented features of imperative languages.


==== Lisp ====
Lisp (1958) stands for ""LISt Processor"". It is tailored to process lists. A full structure of the data is formed by building lists of lists. In memory, a tree data structure is built. Internally, the tree structure lends nicely for recursive functions. The syntax to build a tree is to enclose the space-separated elements within parenthesis. The following is a list of three elements. The first two elements are themselves lists of two elements:
((A B) (HELLO WORLD) 94)
Lisp has functions to extract and reconstruct elements. The function head() returns a list containing the first element in the list. The function tail() returns a list containing everything but the first element. The function cons() returns a list that is the concatenation of other lists. Therefore, the following expression will return the list x:
cons(head(x), tail(x))
One drawback of Lisp is when many functions are nested, the parentheses may look confusing. Modern Lisp environments help ensure parenthesis match. As an aside, Lisp does support the imperative language operations of the assignment statement and goto loops. Also, Lisp is not concerned with the datatype of the elements at compile time. Instead, it assigns (and may reassign) the datatypes at runtime. Assigning the datatype at runtime is called dynamic binding. Whereas dynamic binding increases the language's flexibility, programming errors may linger until late in the software development process.
Writing large, reliable, and readable Lisp programs requires forethought. If properly planned, the program may be much shorter than an equivalent imperative language program. Lisp is widely used in artificial intelligence. However, its usage has been accepted only because it has imperative language operations, making unintended side-effects possible.


==== ML ====
ML (1973) stands for ""Meta Language"". ML checks to make sure only data of the same type are compared with one another. For example, this function has one input parameter (an integer) and returns an integer:

ML is not parenthesis-eccentric like Lisp. The following is an application of times_10():

times_10 2

It returns ""20 : int"". (Both the results and the datatype are returned.)
Like Lisp, ML is tailored to process lists. Unlike Lisp, each element is the same datatype. Moreover, ML assigns the datatype of an element at compile-time. Assigning the datatype at compile-time is called static binding. Static binding increases reliability because the compiler checks the context of variables before they are used.


==== Prolog ====
Prolog (1972) stands for ""PROgramming in LOGic"". It is a logic programming language, based on formal logic. The language was developed by Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel in Marseille, France. It is an implementation of Selective Linear Definite clause resolution, pioneered by Robert Kowalski and others at the University of Edinburgh.
The building blocks of a Prolog program are facts and rules. Here is a simple example:

After all the facts and rules are entered, then a question can be asked:

Will Tom eat Jerry?

The following example shows how Prolog will convert a letter grade to its numeric value:

Here is a comprehensive example:
1) All dragons billow fire, or equivalently, a thing billows fire if the thing is a dragon:

2) A creature billows fire if one of its parents billows fire:

3) A thing X is a parent of a thing Y if X is the mother of Y or X is the father of Y:

4) A thing is a creature if the thing is a dragon:

5) Norberta is a dragon, and Puff is a creature. Norberta is the mother of Puff.

Rule (2) is a recursive (inductive) definition. It can be understood declaratively, without the need to understand how it is executed.
Rule (3) shows how functions are represented by using relations. Here, the mother and father functions ensure that every individual has only one mother and only one father.
Prolog is an untyped language. Nonetheless, inheritance can be represented by using predicates. Rule (4) asserts that a creature is a superclass of a dragon.
Questions are answered using backward reasoning. Given the question:

Silhouette,"A silhouette is an image in outline only, usually filled in as black on a white background.
The inside of a silhouette is featureless.It differs from an outline. That shows the edge of an object in line form, but a silhouette is a solid shape. Silhouette images may be made in any visual artistic medium. The word was first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed.
Cutting portraits, generally in profile, from black card became popular in the mid-18th century. They were a cheap alternative to the portrait miniature. Skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait in a matter of minutes. Other artists, especially about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could also be done quickly.
From its original graphic meaning, the term silhouette has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is backlit, and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as ""in silhouette"".

Internet bot,"A web robot (or Internet bot) is a piece of software that automatically does tasks on the Internet, usually to copy the behaviors of a human on the internet. Web robots are used to do simple tasks faster then a human could do. Web robots are mostly used for web crawling, where a robot downloads the content from a website and looks through the content. 
There have been attempts to restrict web robots from websites. Some websites have a robots.txt file to control what the web robots can or can not do. Any web robot that does not follow the rules can be prevented from accessing the website with the robots.txt file. However if there is no program to enforce the rules in the robots.txt file, then following the rules is a choice for the web robot. There are also web robots deemed as ""good"" such as search engine spiders, who crawl websites for use in search engines such as Google or Bing but there are also web robots deemed as ""bad"" such as web robots who attack political campaigns with the intent of causing harm to that political campaign.

Metal assisted chemical etching,"Metal Assisted Chemical Etching (also known as MACE) is the process of wet chemical etching of semiconductors (mainly silicon) with the use of a metal catalyst, usually deposited on the surface of a semiconductor in the form of a thin film or nanoparticles. The semiconductor, covered with the metal is then immersed in an etching solution containing and oxidizing agent and hydrofluoric acid. The metal on the surface catalyzes the reduction of the oxidizing agent and therefore in turn also the dissolution of silicon. In the majority of the conducted research this phenomenon of increased dissolution rate is also spatially confined, such that it is increased in close proximity to a metal particle at the surface. Eventually this leads to the formation of straight pores that are etched into the semiconductor (see figure to the right). This means that a pre-defined pattern of the metal on the surface can be directly transferred to a semiconductor substrate.


== History of development ==
MACE is a relatively new technology in semiconductor engineering and therefore it has yet to be a process that is used in industry. The first attempts of MACE consisted of a silicon wafer that was partially covered with aluminum and then immersed in an etching solution. This material combination led to an increased etching rate compared to bare silicon. Often this very first attempt is also called galvanic etching instead of metal assisted chemical etching.
Further research showed that a thin film of a noble metal deposited on a silicon wafer's surface can also locally increase the etching rate. In particular, it was observed that noble metal particles sink down into the material when the sample is immersed in an etching solution containing an oxidizing agent and hydrofluoric acid (see image in the introduction).  This method is now commonly called the metal assisted chemical etching of silicon.   
Other semiconductors were also successfully etched with MACE, such as silicon carbide or gallium nitride. However, the main portion of research is dedicated to MACE of silicon.
It has been shown that both noble metals such as gold, platinum, palladium,  and silver, and base metals such as iron, nickel, copper, and aluminium can act as a catalyst in the process.


== Theory ==

Some elements of MACE are commonly accepted in the scientific community, while others are still under debate. There is agreement that the reduction of the oxidizing agent is catalyzed by the noble metal particle (see figure to the left). This means that the metal particle has a surplus of positive charge which is eventually transferred to the silicon substrate. Each of the positive charges in the substrate can be identified as a hole (h+) in the valence band of the substrate, or in more chemical terms it may be interpreted as a weakened Si-Si bond due to the removal of an electron. 
The weakened bonds can be attacked by a nucleophilic species such as HF or H2O, which in turn leads to the dissolution of the silicon substrate in close proximity to the noble metal particle. 
From a thermodynamic point of view, the MACE process is possible because the redox potential of the redox couple corresponding to the used oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate) are below the valence band edge at the electrochemical energy scale. Equivalently, one could say that the electrochemical potential of the electron in the etching solution (due to the presence of oxidizing agent) is lower than the electrochemical potential of the electron in the substrate, hence electrons are removed from the silicon. In the end, this accumulation of positive charge leads to the dissolution of the substrate by hydrofluoric acid.
MACE consists of multiple individual reactions. At the metal particle, the oxidizing agent is reduced. In the case of hydrogen peroxide this can be written down as follows:

  
    
      
        
          
            H
            
              2
            
            
              
            
          
          
            O
            
              2
            
            
              
            
          
          +
          2
          
          
            H
            
              +
            
          
          ⟶
          2
          
          
            H
            
              2
            
            
              
            
          
          O
          +
          2
          
          
            h
            
              +
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\ce {H2O2 + 2H+ -> 2H2O + 2h+}}}
  

The created holes (h+) are then consumed during the dissolution of silicon. There are several possible reactions via which the dissolution can take place, but here just one example is given:

  
    
      
        
          Si
          +
          6
          
          HF
          +
          4
          
          
            h
            
              +
            
          
          ⟶
          
            SiF
            
              6
            
            
              2
              −
            
          
          +
          6
          
          
            H
            
              +
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\ce {Si + 6HF + 4h+ -> SiF6^{2}- + 6H+}}}
  

There are still some unclear aspects of the MACE process. The model proposed above requires contact of the metal particle with the silicon substrate which is somehow conflicting with the etching solution being underneath the particle. This can be explained with a dissolution and redeposition of metal during MACE. In particular it is proposed, that some metal ions from the particle are dissolved and eventually are re-deposited at the silicon surface with a redox reaction. In this case the metal particle (or even larger noble metal thin films) could partially maintain contact to the substrate while also etching could partially take place underneath the metal.
It is also observed that in the vicinity of straight pores as shown in the introduction also a micro-porous region between the pores is formed. Generally this is attributed to holes that diffuse away from the particle and hence contribute to etching at more distant locations.
This behavior is dependent on the doping type of substrate as well as on the type of noble metal particle. Therefore, it is proposed that the formation of such a porous region beneath the straight pores depends on the type of barrier that is formed at the metal/silicon interface. In the case of an upward band bending the electric field in the depletion layer would point towards the metal. Therefore, holes cannot diffuse further into the substrate and thus no formation of a micro-porous region is observed. In the case of downward band-bending holes could escape into the bulk of the silicon substrate and eventually lead to etching there.


== Experimental procedure of MACE ==

As already stated above MACE requires metal particles or a thin metal thin film on top of a silicon substrate. This can be achieved with several methods such as sputter deposition or thermal evaporation. A method to obtain particles from a continuous thin film is thermal dewetting.
These deposition methods can be combined with lithography such that only desired regions are covered with metal. Since MACE is an anisotropic etching method (etching takes place not in all spatial directions) a pre-defined metal pattern can be directly transferred into the silicon substrate.
Another method of depositing metal particles or thin films is electroless plating of noble metals on the surface of silicon. Since the redox potentials of the redox couples of noble metals are below the valence band edge of silicon, noble metal ions can (like described in the theory section) inject holes (or extract electrons) from the substrate while they are reduced. In the end metallic particles or films are obtained at the surface.
Finally, after the deposition of the metal on the surface of silicon, the sample is immersed in an etching solution containing hydrofluoric acid and oxidizing agent. Etching will take place as long as the oxidizing agent and the acid are consumed or until the sample is removed from the etching solution.


== Applications of MACE ==

The reason why MACE is heavily researched is that it allows completely anisotropic etching of silicon substrates which is not possible with other wet chemical etching methods (see figure to the right). Usually the silicon substrate is covered with a protective layer such as photoresist before it is immersed in an etching solution. The etching solution usually has no preferred direction of attacking the substrate, therefore isotropic etching takes place. In semiconductor engineering, however it is often required that the sidewalls of the etched trenches are steep. This is usually realized with methods that operate in the gas-phase such as reactive ion etching. These methods require expensive equipment compared to simple wet etching. MACE, in principle allows the fabrication of steep trenches but is still cheap compared to gas-phase etching methods.


=== Porous silicon ===
Metal assisted chemical etching allows for the production of porous silicon with photoluminescence.


=== Black silicon ===
Black silicon is silicon with a modified surface and is a type of porous silicon. There are several works on obtaining black silicon using MACE technology. The main application of black silicon is solar energy.


=== Black Gallium Arsenide ===
Black Gallium Arsenide with light trapping properties have been also produced by MACE.

Outsourcing of animation,"Outsourcing of animation has become widespread. Starting in the late 1950s, the animation for many low-budget American animated productions has been done by animation studios in foreign countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada, Mexico, Australia, the Philippines, India and North Korea. This is done to lower the cost of animation production.
One of the earliest known examples of animation outsourcing in the United States was carried out by Jay Ward Productions for The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. Though initially envisioned as a Japanese co-production, animation for the series was done by Mexican animation studio Gamma Productions from 1959 to 1964. During the 1960s, Rankin/Bass Productions adopted similar practices. Their stop-motion Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator Tadahito Mochinaga at his studio, MOM Production. Nearly all of the Rankin/Bass' traditional animation was outsourced to at least five Japanese animation companies: MOM Production, Toei Animation, TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan), Mushi Production and Topcraft. Hanna-Barbera was another early example of animation outsourcing; In 1978, Taiwan's Wang Film Productions (originally known as Cuckoo's Nest Studio) was founded as an overseas facility for the studio. In 1988, Hanna-Barbera also started a subsidiary in the Philippines, Fil-Cartoons.
Many entertainment giants such as The Walt Disney Company and IMAX are beginning to outsource an increasing amount of their animation production to Asian countries, particularly India, while other companies are outsourcing animation from India for commercials and computer games. A factor making India an outsourcing destination for animation films is its vast base of English speaking workforce. Animation, which requires understanding of the English language in order to lip-sync the animated media to the audio dialogue, benefits from this particular talent that the Indian workforce possesses. A number of animation companies in the country are also creating skilled manpower for the animation market through various training programs.
Overall though, the main reason why foreign entertainment firms are flocking to India is the cost advantage the country offers. As an example, American animators can cost about $125 an hour; in India, they cost $25 an hour. The total cost for making a full-length animated film in America is estimated to be $100 million to $175 million. In India, it can be made for $15 million to $25 million. Studios in India are also able to provide a large supply of low-cost, high-quality software engineers, even going so far as to establish studios outfitted with state-of-the-art hardware and software to carry out production overseas.
The Walt Disney Company has outsourced a number of major animation projects to studios throughout India. Cable and satellite station Cartoon Network is buying animation films made in South Korea while MTV has added India to its outsourcing center along with the Philippines and South Korea. Applied Gravity, a multimedia company in New Zealand, has outsourced almost 90% of it animation work to Satyam Computer Services’ business process outsourcing subsidiary, Nipuna Services. An animatronics dog for the Discovery Channel’s Animal Planet from popular episode called “K9 to11” and animatronics models for New Zealand theme parks were some of the best-known creations of Applied Gravity in India.

Theological determinism,"Theological determinism is a form of predeterminism which states that all events that happen are pre-ordained, and/or predestined to happen, by one or more divine beings, or that they are destined to occur given the divine beings' omniscience. Theological determinism exists in a number of religions, including Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It is also supported by proponents of Classical pantheism such as the Stoics and by philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza.


== Categorization of theological determinism ==
Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism. 

Strong theological determinism is based on the concept of a creator deity dictating all events in history: ""everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity"".
Weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge – ""because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed"". This form is affirmed by Jainism and vigorously defended by the Kanji sect of Jainism which requires belief in it as a necessary condition and first step for liberation. They often quote Einstein to support their thesis: ""Events do not happen. They already exist and are seen on the Time Machine"". This form also allows for a multiplicity of gods, as there is no contradiction in achieving omniscience by multiple entities.
There exist slight variations on the above categorization. Some claim that theological determinism requires predestination of all events and outcomes by the divinity (i.e. they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all. Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of causal determinism, in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God. With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, ""theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions"", more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.


== Free will and theological determinism ==

There are various implications for metaphysical libertarian free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation. 

Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of hard theological determinism (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and God has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to hard determinism, although it does not invalidate compatibilist free will. Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of omniscience – and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as theological fatalism), or as soft theological determinism (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans (or all organisms as per Jainism, because, otherwise they will never evolve out of their primary existence in the absence of a creator or director of the universe as per an argument similar to free will theorem) have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, whilst knowing their actions before they happen, does not affect the outcome. The belief is that their God's providence is ""compatible"" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). This view is held by Jainism.
A rejection of theological determinism (or divine foreknowledge) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.
The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows;

Assume divine foreknowledge or omniscience
Infallible foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will
This argument is often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included;

Deny the truth value of future contingents, as proposed for example by Aristotle (although this denies foreknowledge and, therefore, theological determinism).
Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by Boethius, Thomas Aquinas, and C. S. Lewis.
Deny the Principle of Alternate Possibilities: ""If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely"". For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.


== History ==
Many Christians have opposed the view that humans do not have free will. Saint Thomas Aquinas, the medieval Roman Catholic theologian, believed strongly that humanity had free will. (However, though he desired to defend a doctrine of free will, he ultimately ended up espousing what today would be known as compatibilism, or ""soft determinism."") The Jesuits were among the leading opponents of this view, because they held that divine grace was actual, in the sense that grace is among other things participative, and that humans could freely benefit from grace by a mediation between their own imperfect wills and the infinite mercy of God.


=== Martin Luther and Desiderius Erasmus ===
The concept of theological determinism has its origins within the Bible as well as within Christianity. A major theological dispute at the time of the sixteenth century would help to force a distinct division in ideas – with an argument between two eminent thinkers of the time, Desiderius Erasmus and Martin Luther, a leading Protestant Reformer. Erasmus in Discourses On the Freedom of the Will believed that God created human beings with free will. He maintained that despite the fall of Adam and Eve freedom still existed. As a result of this humans had the ability to do good or evil. Luther, conversely, attacked this idea in On the Bondage of the Will. He recognised that the issue of autonomy lay at the heart of religious dissension. He depicted an image of humanity manipulated through sin. Humans, for Luther, know what is morally right but are unable to attain it. He claimed that humans thus must give up aspiring to do good in their fallen state and by their own power, as only by this could salvation be formed. This is reflected in the reformation doctrine of Sola Fide, that asserts that salvation is by faith alone and not achieved by meritorious good works. Luther also believed that the fall of Adam and Eve as written in the Bible supported this notion.

Animation,"Animation is a filmmaking technique by which still images are manipulated to create moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets (cels) to be photographed and exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized as an artistic medium, specifically within the entertainment industry. Many animations are either tradtional animations or computer animations made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, has continued to exist alongside these other forms.
Animation is contrasted with live-action film, although the two do not exist in isolation. Many moviemakers have produced films that are a hybrid of the two. As CGI increasingly approximates photographic imagery, filmmakers can easily composite 3D animations into their film rather than using practical effects for showy visual effects (VFX).


== General overview ==
Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.
A cartoon in the animation sense is an animated film, usually short, featuring an exaggerated visual style. The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of human protagonists. Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds), the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that would be lethal in real life.  A cartoon can also be a still humorous drawing, often with the same elements as animated cartoons but with still versions.
The illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and beta movement, but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain. The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable interruptions, is a stroboscopic effect. While animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment.
Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phenakistiscope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. For display on computers, technology such as the animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.
In addition to short films, feature films, television series, animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in video games, motion graphics, user interfaces, and visual effects.
The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance, moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata. Electronic automata were popularized by Disney as animatronics.


== Etymology ==
The word animation stems from the Latin animātiōn, stem of animātiō, meaning 'bestowing of life'. The earlier meaning of the English word is 'liveliness' and has been in use much longer than the meaning of 'moving image medium'.


== History ==


=== Before cinematography ===

Long before modern animation began, audiences around the world were captivated by the magic of moving characters. For centuries, master artists and craftsmen have brought puppets, automatons, shadow puppets, and fantastical lanterns to life, inspiring the imagination through physically manipulated wonders.
In 1833, the stroboscopic disc (better known as the phenakistiscope) introduced the principle of modern animation, which would also be applied in the zoetrope (introduced in 1866), the flip book (1868), the praxinoscope (1877) and film.


=== Silent era ===
When cinematography eventually broke through in the 1890s, the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment. It took years before animation found its way to the cinemas. The successful short The Haunted Hotel (1907) by J. Stuart Blackton popularized stop motion and reportedly inspired Émile Cohl to create Fantasmagorie (1908), regarded as the oldest known example of a complete traditional (hand-drawn) animation on standard cinematographic film. Other great artistic and very influential short films were created by Ladislas Starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by Winsor McCay with detailed hand-drawn animation in films such as Little Nemo (1911) and Gertie the Dinosaur (1914).
During the 1910s, the production of animated ""cartoons"" became an industry in the US. Successful producer John Randolph Bray and animator Earl Hurd, patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century. Felix the Cat, who debuted in 1919, became the first fully realized animal character in the history of American animation.


=== American golden age ===

In 1928, Steamboat Willie, featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, popularized film-with-synchronized-sound and put Walt Disney's studio at the forefront of the animation industry. Although Disney Animation's actual output relative to total global animation output, has always been very small; the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the ""aesthetic norms"" of animation ever since.
The enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of American animation that would last until the 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers, including Walt Disney Productions' Goofy (1932) and Donald Duck (1934), Fleischer Studios/Paramount Cartoon Studios' Out of the Inkwell' Koko the Clown (1918), Bimbo and Betty Boop (1930), Popeye (1933) and Casper the Friendly Ghost (1945), Warner Bros. Cartoon Studios' Looney Tunes' Porky Pig (1935), Daffy Duck (1937), Elmer Fudd (1937–1940), Bugs Bunny (1938–1940), Tweety (1942), Sylvester the Cat (1945), Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner (1949), MGM cartoon studio's Tom and Jerry (1940) and Droopy, Universal Cartoon Studios' Woody Woodpecker (1940), Terrytoons/20th Century Fox's Mighty Mouse (1942), and United Artists' Pink Panther (1963).


=== Features before CGI ===

In 1917, Italian-Argentine director Quirino Cristiani made the first feature-length film El Apóstol (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's Sin dejar rastros in 1918, but one day after its premiere, the film was confiscated by the government.
After working on it for three years, Lotte Reiniger released the German feature-length silhouette animation Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.
In 1937, Walt Disney Studios premiered their first animated feature (using the Rotoscope technique invented by Max Fleischer in 1915) Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features as of May 2020. The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with Gulliver's Travels with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940), Fleischer Studios' second animated feature Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941–1942) and Disney's feature films Cinderella (1950), Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) failed at the box office. For decades afterward, Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until Ralph Bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with An American Tail in 1986.
Although relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques. Soviet Soyuzmultfilm animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018. China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France, and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation.


=== Television ===
Animation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most developed countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching Saturday-morning cartoons. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. Hanna-Barbera Productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as The Flintstones (1960–1966) (the first prime time animated series), Scooby-Doo (since 1969) and Belgian co-production The Smurfs (1981–1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series, the first cartoon of The Simpsons (1987), which later developed into its own show (in 1989) and SpongeBob SquarePants (since 1999) as part of a ""renaissance"" of American animation.
While US animated series also spawned successes internationally, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation. Japanese anime TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, resulting in hit series such as Barbapapa (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973–1977), Wickie und die starken Männer/小さなバイキング ビッケ (Vicky the Viking) (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974), Maya the Honey Bee (Japan/Germany 1975) and The Jungle Book (Italy/Japan 1989).


=== Switch from cels to computers ===

Computer animation was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller Futureworld (1976).
The Rescuers Down Under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera. It was produced using the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), developed by Pixar in collaboration with The Walt Disney Company in the late 1980s, in a style similar to traditional cel animation.
The so-called 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, became the dominant technique following the success of Pixar's Toy Story (1995), the first computer-animated feature in this style.
Most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer-animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance, in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.


== Economic status ==
In 2010, the animation market was estimated to be worth circa US$80 billion. By 2021, the value had increased to an estimated US$370 billion. Animated feature-length films returned the highest gross margins (around 52%) of all film genres between 2004 and 2013. Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s.


== Education, propaganda and commercials ==
The clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment.
During World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. Many American studios, including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts.
Animation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as Snap, Crackle and Pop in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals. Tex Avery was the producer of the first Raid ""Kills Bugs Dead"" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.


== Other media, merchandise and theme parks ==
Apart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.
Animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen (which is often the case in Japan, where many manga are adapted into anime), original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for video games (an interactive form of animation that became its own medium) have been derived from films and vice versa.
Some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.
While very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their Mickey Mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products, as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some pejorative use of Mickey's name, but licensed Disney products sell well, and the so-called Disneyana has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana Fan Club (since 1984).
Disneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other Disney theme parks and resorts. Disney's earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies.


== Awards ==

As with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. Many are part of general or regional film award programs, like the China's Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation (since 1981). Awards programs dedicated to animation, with many categories, include ASIFA-Hollywood's Annie Awards, the Emile Awards in Europe and the Anima Mundi awards in Brazil.


=== Academy Awards ===

Apart from Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film (since 1932) and Best Animated Feature (since 2002), animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories, relatively often for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.
Beauty and the Beast was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture, in 1991. Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010) also received Best Picture nominations, after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.


== Production ==

The creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of filmmaking, with certain unique aspects. Traits common to both live-action and animated feature films are labor intensity and high production costs.
The most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films. It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation). It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film. Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).
Another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film. Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.
This problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles. On traditionally animated projects, maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.
Unlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film. In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.


== Techniques ==


=== Traditional ===

Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) is the process that was used for most animated films of the 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film.
The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. In modern traditionally animated films, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system. Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects. The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional 35 mm film and newer media with digital video. The ""look"" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the character animators' work has remained essentially the same over the past 90 years. Some animation producers have used the term ""tradigital"" (a play on the words ""traditional"" and ""digital"") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.
Examples of traditionally animated feature films include Pinocchio (United States, 1940), Animal Farm (United Kingdom, 1954), Lucky and Zorba (Italy, 1998), and The Illusionist (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include The Lion King (US, 1994), Anastasia (US, 1997), The Prince of Egypt (US, 1998), Akira (Japan, 1988), Spirited Away (Japan, 2001), The Triplets of Belleville (France, 2003), and The Secret of Kells (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).


==== Full ====
Full animation is the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement, having a smooth animation. Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the Walt Disney studio (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King) to the more 'cartoon' styles of the Warner Bros. animation studio. Many of the Disney animated features are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, The Secret of NIMH (US, 1982), The Iron Giant (US, 1999), and Nocturna (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are often animated on ""twos"", sometimes on ""ones"", which means that 12 to 24 drawings are required for a single second of film. 


==== Limited ====

Limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or ""skippy"" movement animation. Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio United Productions of America, limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in Gerald McBoing-Boing (US, 1951), Yellow Submarine (UK, 1968), and certain anime produced in Japan. Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, and other TV animation studios) and later the Internet (web cartoons).


==== Rotoscoping ====

Rotoscoping is a technique patented by Max Fleischer in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame. The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings, as in The Lord of the Rings (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in Waking Life (US, 2001) and A Scanner Darkly (US, 2006). Some other examples are Fire and Ice (US, 1983), Heavy Metal (1981), and Aku no Hana (Japan, 2013).


==== Live-action blending ====

Live-action/animation is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live-action actors into animated shots. One of the earlier uses was in Koko the Clown when Koko was drawn over live-action footage. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of Alice Comedies (1923–1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include Allegro Non Troppo (Italy, 1976), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (US, 1988), Volere volare (Italy 1991), Space Jam (US, 1996) and Osmosis Jones (US, 2001).


=== Stop motion ===

Stop motion is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement. There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the materials used to create the animation. Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop-motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.

Stop motion
Typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation. The puppets generally have an armature inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints. Examples include The Tale of the Fox (France, 1937), The Nightmare Before Christmas (US, 1993), Corpse Bride (US, 2005), Coraline (US, 2009), the films of Jiří Trnka and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series Robot Chicken (US, 2005–present).
Puppetoons
Created using techniques developed by George Pal, are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than manipulating one existing puppet.

Clay animation or Plasticine animation
(Often called claymation, which, however, is a trademarked name). It uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation. The figures may have an armature or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures. Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of Bruce Bickford, where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include The Gumby Show (US, 1957–1967), Mio Mao (Italy, 1974–2005), Morph shorts (UK, 1977–2000), Wallace & Gromit shorts (UK, as of 1989), Jan Švankmajer's Dimensions of Dialogue (Czechoslovakia, 1982), The Trap Door (UK, 1984). Films include Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Chicken Run and The Adventures of Mark Twain.
Strata-cut animation
Most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like ""loaf"" of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.
Cutout animation
A type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth. Examples include Terry Gilliam's animated sequences from Monty Python's Flying Circus (UK, 1969–1974); Fantastic Planet (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973); Tale of Tales (Russia, 1979), Matt Stone and Trey Parker the first cutout animation South Park (1992), the pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of South Park (US, 1997) and the music video Live for the moment, from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and Nívola Uyá, Spain 2014).
Silhouette animation
A variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes. Examples include The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Weimar Republic, 1926) and Princes et Princesses (France, 2000).
Model animation
Stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world. Intercutting, matte effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings. Examples include the work of Ray Harryhausen, as seen in films, Jason and the Argonauts (1963), and the work of Willis H. O'Brien on films, King Kong (1933).
Go motion
A variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop motion. The technique was invented by Industrial Light & Magic and Phil Tippett to create special effect scenes for the film Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Another example is the dragon named ""Vermithrax"" from the 1981 film Dragonslayer.
Object animation
The use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.
Graphic animation
Uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement. At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
Brickfilm
A subgenre of object animation involving using Lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation. These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, YouTube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.
Pixilation
Involves the use of live humans as stop-motion characters. This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects. Examples of pixilation include The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb and Angry Kid shorts, and the Academy Award-winning Neighbours by Norman McLaren.


=== Computer ===

Computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer. 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact. 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.


==== 2D ====

2D animation figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D bitmap graphics and 2D vector graphics. This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, interpolated morphing, onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping. 2D animation has many applications, including After Effects Animation, analog computer animation, Flash animation, and PowerPoint animation. Cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated GIF file of which part is animated.
Final line advection animation is a technique used in 2D animation, to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department. Speaking about using this approach in Paperman, John Kahrs said that ""Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.""
When working with game animations, skeletal 2D animations are commonly created using tools like Spine, DragonBones, Blender COA Tools, Rive, and the built-in Unity editor. The primary benefit of this approach is the ability to reuse images, which reduces the amount of graphics stored in RAM. This principle of maximizing resource efficiency means that by reusing existing elements, you can enhance the visual appeal of animations without needing to create additional graphics.


==== 3D ====

3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The 3D model maker usually starts by creating a 3D polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate. A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment. Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices. This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement.
Other techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and water simulations. These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.


===== Terms =====
Cel shading is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software. The shading looks stark, with less blending of colors. Examples include Skyland (2007, France), The Iron Giant (1999, U.S.), Futurama (1999, U.S.) Appleseed Ex Machina (2007, Japan), The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002, Japan), The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017, Japan)
Machinima – Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds. The term originated from the software introduction in the 1980s demoscene, as well as the 1990s recordings of the first-person shooter video game Quake.
Motion capture is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters. Examples include Polar Express (2004, US), Beowulf (2007, US), A Christmas Carol (2009, US), The Adventures of Tintin (2011, US) kochadiiyan (2014, India)
Computer animation is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life while having a stylized cartoonish appearance, using advanced rendering that mimics i",1
Pothook,"A pothook (or pot hook) is an S-shaped metal hook for suspending a pot over a fire.


== Usage ==
While one extremity of the pothook is hooked to the handle of the pot, the other is caught upon an iron crane moving on a pivot over the fire. Later stoves obviated the necessity for this arrangement, but in the early twentieth century it was still to be seen in great numbers of country cottages and farmhouse kitchens all over England, and in small artisan's houses in the West Midlands and the North.

Wood preservation,"Wood easily degrades without sufficient preservation. Apart from structural wood preservation measures, there are a number of different chemical preservatives and processes (also known as timber treatment, lumber treatment or pressure treatment) that can extend the life of wood, timber, and their associated products, including engineered wood. These generally increase the durability and resistance from being destroyed by insects or fungi.


== History ==

As proposed by Richardson, treatment of wood has been practiced for almost as long as the use of wood itself. There are records of wood preservation reaching back to ancient Greece during Alexander the Great's rule, where bridge wood was soaked in olive oil. The Romans protected their ship hulls by brushing the wood with tar. During the Industrial Revolution, wood preservation became a cornerstone of the wood processing industry. Inventors and scientists such as Bethell, Boucherie, Burnett and Kyan made historic developments in wood preservation, with the preservative solutions and processes. Commercial pressure treatment began in the latter half of the 19th century with the protection of railroad cross-ties using creosote. Treated wood was used primarily for industrial, agricultural, and utility applications, where it is still used, until its use grew considerably (at least in the United States) in the 1970s, as homeowners began building decks and backyard projects. Innovation in treated timber products continues to this day, with consumers becoming more interested in less toxic materials.


== Hazards ==
Wood that has been industrially pressure-treated with approved preservative products poses a limited risk to the public and should be disposed of properly. On December 31, 2003, the U.S. wood treatment industry stopped treating residential lumber with arsenic and chromium (chromated copper arsenate, or CCA). This was a voluntary agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. CCA was replaced by copper-based pesticides, with exceptions for certain industrial uses. CCA may still be used for outdoor products like utility trailer beds and non-residential construction like piers, docks, and agricultural buildings. Industrial wood preservation chemicals are generally not available directly to the public and may require special approval to import or purchase, depending on the product and the jurisdiction where being used. In most countries, industrial wood preservation operations are notifiable industrial activities that require licensing from relevant regulatory authorities such as EPA or equivalent. Reporting and licensing conditions vary widely, depending on the particular chemicals used and the country of use.
Although pesticides are used to treat lumber, preserving lumber protects natural resources (in the short term) by enabling wood products to last longer. Previous poor practices in industry have left legacies of contaminated ground and water around wood treatment sites in some cases. However, under currently approved industry practices and regulatory controls, such as implemented in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and elsewhere, environmental impact of these operations should be minimal.
Wood treated with modern preservatives is generally safe to handle, given appropriate handling precautions and personal protection measures. However, treated wood may present certain hazards in some circumstances, such as during combustion or where loose wood dust particles or other fine toxic residues are generated, or where treated wood comes into direct contact with food and agriculture.
Preservatives containing copper in the form of microscopic particles have recently been introduced to the market, usually with ""micronized"" or ""micro"" trade names and designations such as MCQ or MCA. The manufacturers represent that these products are safe and EPA has registered these products.
The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) recommends that all treated wood be accompanied by a Consumer Information Sheet (CIS), to communicate safe handling and disposal instructions, as well as potential health and environmental hazards of treated wood. Many producers have opted to provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) instead. Although the practice of distributing MSDS instead of CIS is widespread, there is an ongoing debate regarding the practice and how to best communicate potential hazards and hazard mitigation to the end-user. Neither MSDS nor the newly adopted International Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are required for treated lumber under current U.S. Federal law.


== Chemical ==
Chemical preservatives can be classified into three broad categories: 

water-borne preservatives
oil-borne preservatives
light organic solvent preservatives (LOSPs).


=== Micronized copper ===
Particulate (micronised or dispersed) copper preservative technology has been introduced in the US and Europe. In these systems, copper is ground into micro sized particles and suspended in water rather than dissolved, as is the case with other copper products such as ACQ and copper azole. There are two particulate copper systems in production. One system uses a quat biocide system (known as MCQ) and is a derivative of ACQ. The other uses an azole biocide (known as MCA or μCA-C) derived from copper azole.
Two particulate copper systems, one marketed as MicroPro and the other as Wolmanized using μCA-C formulation, have achieved Environmentally Preferable Product (EPP) certification. The EPP certification was issued by Scientific Certifications Systems (SCS) and is based on a comparative life-cycle impact assessments with an industry standard.
The copper particle size used in the ""micronized"" copper beads ranges from 1 to 700 nm with an average under 300 nm. Larger particles (such as actual micron-scale particles) of copper do not adequately penetrate the wood cell walls. These micronized preservatives use nano particles of copper oxide or copper carbonate, for which there are alleged safety concerns. An environmental group petitioned EPA in 2011 to revoke the registration of the micronized copper products, citing safety issues.


==== Alkaline copper quaternary ====
Alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) is a preservative made of copper, a fungicide, and a quaternary ammonium compound (quat) like didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, an insecticide which also augments the fungicidal treatment. ACQ has come into wide use in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia following restrictions on CCA. Its use is governed by national and international standards, which determine the volume of preservative uptake required for a specific timber end use.
Since it contains high levels of copper, ACQ-treated timber is five times more corrosive to common steel. It is necessary to use fasteners meeting or exceeding requirements for ASTM A 153 Class D, such as ceramic-coated, as mere galvanized and even common grades of stainless steel corrode. The U.S. began mandating the use of non-arsenic containing wood preservatives for virtually all residential use timber in 2004.
The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) standards for ACQ require a retention of 0.15 lb/cu ft (2.4 kg/m3) for above ground use and 0.40 lb/cu ft (6.4 kg/m3) for ground contact.
Chemical Specialties, Inc (CSI, now Viance) received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2002 for commercial introduction of ACQ. Its widespread use has eliminated major quantities of arsenic and chromium previously contained in CCA.


==== Copper azole ====
Copper azole preservative (denoted as CA-B and CA-C under American Wood Protection Association/AWPA standards) is a major copper based wood preservative that has come into wide use in Canada, the US, Europe, Japan and Australia following restrictions on CCA. Its use is governed by national and international standards, which determine the volume of preservative uptake required for a specific timber end use.
Copper azole is similar to ACQ with the difference being that the dissolved copper preservative is augmented by an azole co-biocide like organic triazoles such as tebuconazole or propiconazole, which are also used to protect food crops, instead of the quat biocide used in ACQ. The azole co-biocide yields a copper azole product that is effective at lower retentions than required for equivalent ACQ performance. The general appearance of wood treated with copper azole preservative is similar to CCA with a green colouration.
Copper azole treated wood is marketed widely under the Preserve CA and Wolmanized brands in North America, and the Tanalith brand across Europe and other international markets.
The AWPA standard retention for CA-B is 0.10 lb/cu ft (1.6 kg/m3) for above ground applications and 0.21 lb/cu ft (3.4 kg/m3) for ground contact applications. Type C copper azole, denoted as CA-C, has been introduced under the Wolmanized and Preserve brands. The AWPA standard retention for CA-C is 0.06 lb/cu ft (0.96 kg/m3) for above ground applications and 0.15 lb/cu ft (2.4 kg/m3) for ground contact applications.


=== Copper naphthenate ===
Copper naphthenate, invented in Denmark in 1911, has been used effectively for many applications including: fencepost, canvas, nets, greenhouses, utility poles, railroad ties, beehives, and wooden structures in ground contact. Copper naphthenate is registered with the EPA as a non-restricted use pesticide, so there is no federal applicators licensing requirements for its use as a wood preservative. Copper Naphthenate can be applied by brush, dip, or pressure treatment.
The University of Hawaii has found that copper naphthenate in wood at loadings of 1.5 lb/cu ft (24 kg/m3) is resistant to Formosan termite attack. On February 19, 1981, the Federal Register outlined the EPA's position regarding the health risks associated with various wood preservatives. As a result, the National Park Service recommended the use of copper naphthenate in its facilities as an approved substitute for pentachlorophenol, creosote, and inorganic arsenicals. A 50-year study presented to AWPA in 2005 by Mike Freeman and Douglas Crawford says, ""This study reassessed the condition of the treated wood posts in southern Mississippi, and statistically calculated the new expected post life span. It was determined that commercial wood preservatives, like pentachlorophenol in oil, creosote, and copper naphthenate in oil, provided excellent protection for posts, with life spans now calculated to exceed 60 years. Surprisingly, creosote and penta treated posts at 75% of the recommended AWPA retention, and copper naphthenate at 50% of the required AWPA retention, gave excellent performance in this AWPA Hazard Zone 5 site. Untreated southern pine posts lasted 2 years in this test site.""
The AWPA M4 Standard for the care of preservative-treated wood products, reads, ""The appropriateness of the preservation system for field treatment shall be determined by the type of preservative originally used to protect the product and the availability of a field treatment preservative. Because many preservative products are not packaged and labeled for use by the general public, a system different from the original treatment may need to be utilized for field treatment. Users shall carefully read and follow the instructions and precautions listed on the product label when using these materials. Copper naphthenate preservatives containing a minimum of 2.0% copper metal are recommended for material originally treated with copper naphthenate, pentachlorophenol, creosote, creosote solution or waterborne preservatives."" The M4 Standard has been adopted by the International Code Council's (ICC) 2015 International Building Code (IBC) section 2303.1.9 Preservative-treated Wood, and 2015 International Residential Code (IRC) R317.1.1 Field Treatment. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials AASHTO has also adopted the AWPA M4 Standard.
A waterborne copper naphthenate is sold to consumers under the tradename QNAP 5W. Oilborne copper naphthenates with 1% copper as metal solutions are sold to consumers under the tradenames Copper Green, and Wolmanized Copper Coat, a 2% copper as metal solution is sold under the tradename Tenino.


=== Chromated copper arsenate (CCA) ===

In CCA treatment, copper is the primary fungicide, arsenic is a secondary fungicide and an insecticide, and chromium is a fixative which also provides ultraviolet (UV) light resistance. Recognized for the greenish tint it imparts to timber, CCA is a preservative that was very common for many decades.
In the pressure treatment process, an aqueous solution of CCA is applied using a vacuum and pressure cycle, and the treated wood is then stacked to dry. During the process, the mixture of oxides reacts to form insoluble compounds, helping with leaching problems.
The process can apply varying amounts of preservative at varying levels of pressure to protect the wood against increasing levels of attack. Increasing protection can be applied (in increasing order of attack and treatment) for: exposure to the atmosphere, implantation within soil, or insertion into a marine environment.
In the last decade concerns were raised that the chemicals may leach from the wood into surrounding soil, resulting in concentrations higher than naturally occurring background levels. A study cited in Forest Products Journal found 12–13% of the chromated copper arsenate leached from treated wood buried in compost during a 12-month period. Once these chemicals have leached from the wood, they are likely to bind to soil particles, especially in soils with clay or soils that are more alkaline than neutral. In the United States the US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report in 2002 stating that exposure to arsenic from direct human contact with CCA treated wood may be higher than was previously thought. On 1 January 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a voluntary agreement with industry began restricting the use of CCA in treated timber in residential and commercial construction, with the exception of shakes and shingles, permanent wood foundations, and certain commercial applications. This was in an effort to reduce the use of arsenic and improve environmental safety, although the EPA were careful to point out that they had not concluded that CCA treated wood structures in service posed an unacceptable risk to the community. The EPA did not call for the removal or dismantling of existing CCA treated wood structures.
In Australia, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) restricted the use of CCA preservative for treatment of timber used in certain applications from March 2006. CCA may no longer be used to treat wood used in 'intimate human contact' applications such as children's play equipment, furniture, residential decking and handrailing. Use for low contact residential, commercial and industrial applications remains unrestricted, as does its use in all other situations. The APVMA decision to restrict the use of CCA in Australia was a precautionary measure, even though the report found no evidence that demonstrated CCA treated timber posed unreasonable risks to humans in normal use. Similarly to the US EPA, the APVMA did not recommend dismantling or removal of existing CCA treated wood structures.
In Europe, Directive 2003/2/EC restricts the marketing and use of arsenic, including CCA wood treatment. CCA treated wood is not permitted to be used in residential or domestic constructions. It is permitted for use in various industrial and public works, such as bridges, highway safety fencing, electric power transmission and telecommunications poles.
In the United Kingdom waste timber treated with CCA was classified in July 2012 as hazardous waste by the department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.


=== Other copper compounds ===
These include copper HDO (Bis-(N-cyclohexyldiazeniumdioxy)-copper or CuHDO), copper chromate, copper citrate, acid copper chromate, and ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA). The CuHDO treatment is an alternative to CCA, ACQ and CA used in Europe and in approval stages for United States and Canada. ACZA is generally used for marine applications.


=== Borate ===
Boric acid, oxides and salts (borates) are effective wood preservatives and are supplied under numerous brand names throughout the world. One of the most common compounds used is disodium octaborate tetrahydrate Na2B8O13·4H2O, commonly abbreviated DOT. Borate treated wood is of low toxicity to humans, and does not contain copper or other heavy metals. However, unlike most other preservatives, borate compounds do not become fixed in the wood and can be partially leached out if exposed repeatedly to water that flows away rather than evaporating (evaporation leaves the borate behind so is not a problem). Even though leaching will not normally reduce boron concentrations below effective levels for preventing fungal growth, borates should not be used where they will be exposed to repeated rain, water or ground contact unless the exposed surfaces are treated to repel water.  Zinc-borate compounds are less susceptible to leaching than sodium-borate compounds, but are still not recommended for below-ground use unless the timber is first sealed. Recent interest in low toxicity timber for residential use, along with new regulations restricting some wood preservation agents, has resulted in a resurgence of the use of borate treated wood for floor beams and internal structural members. Researchers at CSIRO in Australia have developed organoborates which are much more resistant to leaching, while still providing timber with good protection from termite and fungal attack. The cost of the production of these modified borates will limit their widespread take-up but they are likely to be suitable for certain niche applications, especially where low mammalian toxicity is of paramount importance.


=== PTI ===
Recent concerns about the health and environmental effects of metallic wood preservatives have created a market interest in non-metallic wood preservatives such as propiconazole-tebuconazole-imidacloprid better known as PTI. The American Wood Protection Association (AWPA) standards for PTI require a retention of 0.018 lb/cu ft (0.29 kg/m3) for above ground use and 0.013 lb/cu ft (0.21 kg/m3) when applied in combination with a wax stabilizer. The AWPA has not developed a standard for a PTI ground contact preservative, so PTI is currently limited to above ground applications such as decks. All three of the PTI components are also used in food crop applications. The very low required amounts of PTI in pressure treated wood further limits effects and substantially decreases the freight costs and associated environmental impacts for shipping preservative components to the pressure treating plants.
The PTI preservative imparts very little color to the wood. Producers generally add a color agent or a trace amount of copper solution so as to identify the wood as pressure treated and to better match the color of other pressure treated wood products. The PTI wood products are very well adapted for paint and stain applications with no bleed-through. The addition of the wax stabilizer allows a lower preservative retention plus substantially reduces the tendency of wood to warp and split as it dries. In combination with normal deck maintenance and sealer applications, the stabilizer helps maintain appearance and performance over time. PTI pressure treated wood products are no more corrosive than untreated wood and are approved for all types of metal contact, including aluminum.
PTI pressure treated wood products are relatively new to the market place and are not yet widely available in building supply stores. However, there are some suppliers selling PTI products for delivery anywhere in the US on a job lot order basis.


=== Sodium silicate ===
Sodium silicate is produced by fusing sodium carbonate with sand or heating both ingredients under pressure. It has been in use since the 19th century. It can be a deterrent against insect attack and possesses minor flame-resistant properties; however, it is easily washed out of wood by moisture, forming a flake-like layer on top of the wood.
Timber Treatment Technology, LLC, markets TimberSIL, a sodium silicate wood preservative. The TimberSIL proprietary process surrounds the wood fibers with a protective, non-toxic, amorphous glass matrix. The result is a product the company calls ""Glass Wood,"" which they claim is Class A fire-retardant, chemically inert, rot and decay resistant, and superior in strength to untreated wood. Timbersil is currently involved in litigation over its claims.


=== Potassium silicate ===
There are a number of European natural paint fabricants that have developed potassium silicate (potassium waterglass) based preservatives. They frequently include boron compounds, cellulose, lignin and other plant extracts. They are a surface application with a minimal impregnation for internal use.


=== Bifenthrin spray ===
In Australia, a water-based bifenthrin preservative has been developed to improve the insect resistance of timber. As this preservative is applied by spray, it only penetrates the outer 2 mm of the timber cross-section. Concerns have been raised as to whether this thin-envelope system will provide protection against insects in the longer term, particularly when exposed to sunlight for extended periods.


=== Fire retardant treated ===
The fireproofing of wood utilizes a fire retardant chemical that remains stable in high temperature environments. The fire retardant is applied under pressure at a wood treating plant like the preservatives described above, or applied as a surface coating.
In both cases, treatment provides a physical barrier to flame spread. The treated wood chars but does not oxidize. Effectively this creates a convective layer that transfers flame heat to the wood in a uniform way which significantly slows the progress of fire to the material. There are several commercially available wood-based construction materials using pressure-treatment (such as those marketed in the United States and elsewhere under the trade names of 'FirePro', 'Burnblock' 'Wood-safe, 'Dricon', 'D-Blaze,' and 'Pyro-Guard'), as well as factory-applied coatings under the trade names of 'PinkWood' and 'NexGen'. Some site-applied coatings as well as brominated fire retardants have lost favor due to safety concerns as well as concerns surrounding the consistency of application. Specialized treatments also exist for wood used in weather-exposed applications.
The only impregnation-applied fire retardant commercially available in Australia is 'NexGen'. 'Guardian', which used calcium formate as a 'powerful wood modifying agent', was removed from sale in early 2010 for unspecified reasons.


=== Oil-borne ===
These include pentachlorophenol (""penta"") and creosote. They emit a strong petrochemical odor and are generally not used in consumer products. Both of these pressure treatments routinely protect wood for 40 years in most applications.


==== Coal-tar creosote ====

Creosote was the first wood preservative to gain industrial importance more than 150 years ago and it is still widely used today for protection of industrial timber components where long service life is essential.
Creosote is a tar-based preservative that is commonly used for utility poles and railroad ties or sleepers. Creosote is one of the oldest wood preservatives, and was originally derived from a wood distillate, but now, virtually all creosote is manufactured from the distillation of coal tar. Creosote is regulated as a pesticide, and is not usually sold to the general public.


==== Linseed oil ====
In recent years in Australia and New Zealand, linseed oil has been incorporated in preservative formulations as a solvent and water repellent to ""envelope treat"" timber. This involves just treating the outer 5 mm of the cross-section of a timber member with preservative (e.g., permethrin 25:75), leaving the core untreated. While not as effective as CCA or LOSP methods, envelope treatments are significantly cheaper, as they use far less preservative. Major preservative manufacturers add a blue (or red) dye to envelope treatments. Blue colored timber is for use south of the Tropic of Capricorn and red for elsewhere. The colored dye also indicates that the timber is treated for resistance to termites/white ants. There is an ongoing promotional campaign in Australia for this type of treatment.


=== Other emulsions ===


==== Light organic solvent preservatives (LOSP) ====
This class of timber treatments use white spirit, or light oils such as kerosene, as the solvent carrier to deliver preservative compounds into timber. Synthetic pyrethroids are typically used as an insecticide, such as permethrin, bifenthrin or deltamethrin. In Australia and New Zealand, the most common formulations use permethrin as an insecticide, and propiconazole and tebuconazole as fungicides. While still using a chemical preservative, this formulation contains no heavy-metal compounds.
With the introduction of strict volatile organic compound (VOC) laws in the European Union, LOSPs have disadvantages due to the high cost and long process times associated with vapour-recovery systems. LOSPs have been emulsified into water-based solvents. While this does significantly reduce VOC emissions, the timber swells during treatment, removing many of the advantages of LOSP formulations.


=== Epoxy ===
Various epoxy resins usually thinned with a solvent like acetone or methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) can be used to both preserve and seal wood. The wood coatings market in general will exceed $12 billion by 2027.


=== New technologies ===


==== Biological modified timber ====

Biological modified timber is treated with biopolymers from agricultural waste. After drying and curing, the soft timber becomes durable and strong. With this process fast growing pinewood acquires properties similar to tropical hardwood. Production facilities for this process are in The Netherlands and is known under the trade name “NobelWood”.
From agricultural waste, like sugarcane bagasse, furfuryl alcohol is manufactured. Theoretically this alcohol can be from any fermented bio-mass waste and therefore can be called a green chemical. After condensation reactions pre-polymers are formed from furfuryl alcohol. Fast growing softwood is impregnated with the water-soluble bio-polymer. After impregnation the wood is dried and heated which initiates a polymerisation reaction between the bio-polymer and the wood cells. This process results in wood cells which are resistant to microorganisms. At the moment the only timber species which is being used for this process is Pinus radiata. This is the fastest growing tree species on Earth that has a porous structure which is particularly suitable for impregnation processes.
The technique is applied to timber mainly for the building industry as a cladding material. The technique is being further developed in order to reach similar physical and biological properties of other polyfurfuryl impregnated wood species. Besides the impregnation with the biopolymers the timber can also be impregnated with fire retardant resins. This combination creates a timber with durability class I and a fire safety certification of Euro class B.


==== Acetylation of wood ====

Chemical modification of wood at the molecular level has been used to improve its performance properties. Many chemical reaction systems for the modification of wood, especially those using various types of anhydrides, have been published; however, the reaction of wood with acetic anhydride has been the most studied. 
The physical properties of any material are determined by its chemical structure. Wood contains an abundance of chemical groups called free hydroxyls. Free hydroxyl groups readily absorb and release water according to changes in the climatic conditions to which they are exposed. This is the main reason why wood's dimensional stability is impacted by swelling and shrinking. It is also believed that the digestion of wood by enzymes initiates at the free hydroxyl sites, which is one of the principal reasons why wood is prone to decay.
Acetylation effectively changes the compounds with free hydroxyls within wood into acetate esters. This is done by reacting the wood with acetic anhydride, which comes from acetic acid. When free hydroxyl groups are transformed to acetoxy groups, the ability of the wood to absorb water is greatly reduced, rendering the wood more dimensionally stable and, because it is no longer digestible, extremely durable. In general, softwoods naturally have an acetyl content from 0.5 to 1.5% and more durable hardwoods from 2 to 4.5%. Acetylation takes wood well beyond these levels with corresponding benefits. These include an extended coatings life due to acetylated wood acting as a more stable substrate for paints and translucent coatings. acetylated wood is non-toxic and does not have the environmental issues associated with traditional preservation techniques.
The acetylation of wood was first done in Germany in 1928 by Fuchs. In 1946, Tarkow, Stamm and Erickson first described the use of wood acetylation to stabilize wood from swelling in water. Since the 1940s, many laboratories around the world have looked at acetylation of many different types of woods and agricultural resources.
In spite of the vast amount of research on chemical modification of wood, and, more specifically, on the acetylation of wood, commercialization did not come easily. The first patent on the acetylation of wood was filed by Suida in Austria in 1930. Later, in 1947, Stamm and Tarkow filed a patent on the acetylation of wood and boards using pyridine as a catalyst. In 1961, the Koppers Company published a technical bulletin on the acetylation of wood using no catalysis, but with an organic cosolvent In 1977, in Russia, Otlesnov and Nikitina came close to commercialization, but the process was discontinued, presumably because cost-effectiveness could not be achieved. In 2007, Titan Wood, a London-based company, with production facilities in The Netherlands, achieved cost-effective commercialization and began large-scale production of acetylated wood under the trade name ""Accoya"".


=== Natural ===


==== Copper plating ====
Copper plating or copper sheathing is the practice of covering wood, most commonly wooden hulls of ships, with copper metal. As metallic copper is both repellent and toxic to fungus, insects such as termites, and marine bi-valves this would preserve the wood and also act as an anti-fouling measure to prevent aquatic life from attaching to the ship's hull and reducing a ship's speed and maneuverability.  Modern marine bottom paints often incorporate a significant amount of copper in their formulations for the same reason, although they are not recommended for aluminum hulls because of the possibilities for galvanic corrosion.


==== Naturally rot-resistant woods ====
These species are resistant to decay in their natural state, due to high levels of organic chemicals called extractives, mainly polyphenols, providing them antimicrobial properties. Extractives are chemicals that are deposited in the heartwood of certain tree species as they convert sapwood to heartwood; they are present in both parts though. Huon pine (Lagarostrobos franklinii), merbau (Intsia bijuga), ironbark (Eucalyptus spp.), totara (Podocarpus totara), puriri (Vitex lucens), kauri (Agathis australis), and many cypresses, such as coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata), fall in this category. However, many of these species tend to be prohibitively expensive for general construction applications.
Huon pine was used for ship hulls in the 19th century, but over-harvesting and Huon pine's extremely slow growth rate makes this now a specialty timber. Huon pine is so rot resistant that fallen trees from many years ago are still commercially valuable. Merbau is still a popular decking timber and has a long life in above ground applications, but it is logged in an unsustainable manner and is too hard and brittle for general use. Ironbark is a good choice where available. It is harvested from both old-growth and plantation in Australia and is highly resistant to rot and termites. It is most commonly used for fence posts and house stumps. Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) have long been used for rot-resistant fence ",1
Hydropower,"Hydropower is the capture of the energy of moving water for some useful purpose. 
In the 1830s, at the peak of the canal-building era, hydropower was used to transport barge traffic up and down steep hills using inclined plane railroads. For direct mechanical power transmission industries that used hydropower had to be near the waterfall. For example, during the last half of the 19th century, many grist mills were built at Saint Anthony Falls, to use the 50 foot (15 metre) drop in the Mississippi River. The mills were important for the growth of Minneapolis. Today the largest use of hydropower is for electric power generation. That allows low cost energy to be used at long distances from the watercourse. 


== Types of water power ==
There are many forms of water power:

Water wheels, used for hundreds of years to power mills and machinery
Hydroelectric energy, a term usually reserved for hydroelectric dams.
Tidal energy, which captures energy from the tides in horizontal direction
Tidal stream power, which does the same, but vertically
Wave power, which uses the energy in waves


=== Hydroelectric power ===

Hydroelectric power is a means of making electricity without burning fuel. Hydroelectric power supplies about 715,000 MWe or 19% of world electricity (16% in 2003). Large dams are still being designed. Apart from a few countries with plenty of it, hydro power is normally applied to peak load demand because it is readily stopped and started. Nevertheless, hydroelectric power is probably not a major option for future energy production in the developed nations, because most major sites within these nations are either already being exploited or are unavailable for other reasons, such as environmental considerations.
Hydropower produces essentially no carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions, in contrast to burning fossil fuels, and is not a significant contributor to global warming through CO2.
Hydroelectric power can be far less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuel or nuclear energy. Areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry. Environmental concerns about the effects of reservoirs may prohibit development of economic hydropower sources.


=== Tidal power ===
Harnessing the tides in a bay or estuary has been achieved in France (since 1966), Canada and Russia, and could be achieved in other areas with a large tidal range. The trapped water turns turbines as it is released through the tidal barrage in either direction. Another possible fault is that the system would generate electricity most efficiently in bursts every six hours (once every tide). This limits how tidal energy can be used. 


==== Tidal stream power ====
A relatively new technology, tidal stream generators draw energy from currents in much the same way that wind generators do. The higher density of water means that a single generator can provide significant power. This technology is at the early stages of development and will need more research before it can produce any higher amount of energy.
But several prototypes were tested in the UK, in France and the USA. Already in 2003 a turbine that produces 300 kW was tested in the UK.
The Canadian company Blue Energy has plans for installing very large arrays tidal current devices mounted in what they call a 'tidal fence' in various locations around the world, based on a vertical axis turbine design.


=== Wave power ===
Power from ocean surface wave motion might produce much more energy than tides. It has been tested that it is possible to produce energy from waves, particularly in Scotland in the UK. But there are still a lot of technical problems.
A prototype shore based wave power generator is being constructed at Port Kembla in Australia and is expected to generate up to 500 MWh annually. Wave energy is captured by an air driven generator and converted to electricity. For countries with large coastlines and rough sea conditions, the energy of waves offers the possibility of generating electricity in utility volumes. Excess power during rough seas could be used to produce hydrogen.

Fire ecology,"Fire ecology is a scientific discipline concerned with  the effects of fire on natural ecosystems. Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal. Many plant species in fire-affected environments use fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce. Wildfire suppression not only endangers these species, but also the animals that depend upon them.
Wildfire suppression campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are harmful to nature. Ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire.  More generally, fire is now regarded as a 'natural disturbance', similar to flooding, windstorms, and landslides, that has driven the evolution of species and controls the characteristics of ecosystems.
Fire suppression, in combination with other human-caused environmental changes, may have resulted in unforeseen consequences for natural ecosystems. Some large wildfires in the United States have been blamed on years of fire suppression and the continuing expansion of people into fire-adapted ecosystems as well as climate change. Land managers are faced with tough questions regarding how to restore a natural fire regime, but allowing wildfires to burn is likely the least expensive and most effective method in many situations.


== History ==
Fire has played a major role in shaping the world's vegetation. The biological process of photosynthesis began to concentrate the atmospheric oxygen needed for combustion during the Devonian approximately 350 million years ago. Then, approximately 125 million years ago, fire began to influence the habitat of land plants.
In the 20th century ecologist Charles Cooper made a plea for fire as an ecosystem process.


== Fire components ==

A fire regime describes the characteristics of fire and how it interacts with a particular ecosystem. Its ""severity"" is a term that ecologists use to refer to the impact that a fire has on an ecosystem. It is usually studied using tools such as remote sensing which can detect burned area estimates, severity and fire risk associated with an area. Ecologists can define this in many ways, but one way is through an estimate of plant mortality.
Fires can burn at three elevation levels. Ground fires will burn through soil that is rich in organic matter. Surface fires will burn through living and dead plant material at ground level. Crown fires will burn through the tops of shrubs and trees. Ecosystems generally experience a mix of all three.
Fires will often break out during a dry season, but in some areas wildfires also commonly occur during times of year when lightning is prevalent. The frequency over a span of years at which fire will occur at a particular location is a measure of how common wildfires are in a given ecosystem. It is either defined as the average interval between fires at a given site, or the average interval between fires in an equivalent specified area.
Defined as the energy released per unit length of fireline (kW m−1), wildfire intensity can be estimated either as

the product of
the linear spread rate (m s−1),
the low heat of combustion (kJ kg−1),
and the combusted fuel mass per unit area,
or it can be estimated from the flame length.


== Abiotic responses ==
Fires can affect soils through heating and combustion processes. Depending on the temperatures of the soils during the combustion process, different effects will happen- from evaporation of water at the lower temperature ranges, to the combustion of soil organic matter and the formation of pyrogenic organic matter, such as charcoal.
Fires can cause changes in soil nutrients through a variety of mechanisms, which include oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water, but the event must usually be of high temperatures for significant loss of nutrients to occur. However, the quantity of bioavailable nutrients in the soil usually increases due to the ash that is generated, as compared to the slow release of nutrients by decomposition. Rock spalling (or thermal exfoliation) accelerates weathering of rock and potentially the release of some nutrients.
Increase in the pH of the soil following a fire is commonly observed, most likely due to the formation of calcium carbonate, and the subsequent decomposition of this calcium carbonate to calcium oxide when temperatures get even higher. It could also be due to the increased cation content in the soil due to the ash, which temporarily increases soil pH. Microbial activity in the soil might also increase due to the heating of soil and increased nutrient content in the soil, though studies have also found complete loss of microbes on the top layer of soil after a fire. Overall, soils become more basic (higher pH) following fires because of acid combustion. By driving novel chemical reactions at high temperatures, fire can even alter the texture and structure of soils by affecting the clay content and the soil's porosity.
Removal of vegetation following a fire can cause several effects on the soil, such as increasing the temperatures of the soil during the day due to increased solar radiation on the soil surface, and greater cooling due to loss of radiative heat at night. Less plant matter to intercept rain will allow more to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soils might increase. However, ash can be water repellent when dry, and therefore water content and availability might not actually increase.


== Biotic responses and adaptations ==


=== Plants ===

Plants have evolved many adaptations to cope with fire.  Of these adaptations, one of the best-known is likely pyriscence, where maturation and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called serotiny, although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus.  All pyriscent plants are serotinous, but not all serotinous plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof).  On the other hand, germination of seed activated by trigger is not to be confused with pyriscence; it is known as physiological dormancy.
In chaparral communities in Southern California, for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire. This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) and the young plants can then capitalize on the lack of competition in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds. Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves. Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.


==== Fire intolerance ====
Fire-intolerant plant species tend to be highly flammable and are destroyed completely by fire. Some of these plants and their seeds may simply fade from the community after a fire and not return; others have adapted to ensure that their offspring survives into the next generation. ""Obligate seeders"" are plants with large, fire-activated seed banks that germinate, grow, and mature rapidly following a fire, in order to reproduce and renew the seed bank before the next fire.
Seeds may contain the receptor protein KAI2, that is activated by the growth hormones karrikin released by the fire.


==== Fire tolerance ====
Fire-tolerant species are able to withstand a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are sometimes referred to as ""resprouters"". Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire. For example, after an Australian bushfire, the Mountain Grey Gum tree (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa) starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves from the base of the tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.


==== Fire resistance ====
Fire-resistant plants suffer little damage during a characteristic fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) is an example of a tree species that suffers little to no crown damage during a low severity fire because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.


=== Animals, birds and microbes ===

Like plants, animals display a range of abilities to cope with fire, but they differ from most plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although birds may be vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit from being able to take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. In fact, many wildlife species globally are dependent on recurring fires in fire-dependent ecosystems to create and maintain habitat. Some anthropological and ethno-ornithological evidence suggests that certain species of fire-foraging raptors may engage in intentional fire propagation to flush out prey. Mammals are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. Amphibians and reptiles may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud.
Some arthropods also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril. Microbial organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but are more likely to be able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire. The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover. Certain species of fungi, such as Cylindrocarpon destructans appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.


== Fire and ecological succession ==
Fire behavior is different in every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to those that have been untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of ecological succession in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire.  Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing herbaceous plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants. Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire. Both natural and human fires affect all ecosystems from peatlands to shrublands to forests and tropical landscapes. This impacts the way that the ecosystem is structured and functions. Though there have always been wildfires naturally, the frequency of wildfires has increased at a rapid rate in recent years. This is largely due to decreases in precipitation, increases in temperature, and increases in human ignitions.
Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting different stages in this process of succession, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. Soil characteristics will be a factor in determining the specific nature of a fire-adapted ecosystem, as will climate and topography.  Different frequencies of fire also result in different successional pathways; short intervals between fires often eliminate tree species due to the time required to rebuild a seed bank, resulting in replacement by lighter seeded species like grasses and forbs.


== Examples of fire in different ecosystems ==


=== Forests ===

Mild to moderate fires burn in the forest understory, removing small trees and herbaceous groundcover. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns of the trees and kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates complex early seral forest habitat, or snag forest with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil. Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as climate and topography play an important role in determining fire severity and fire extent. Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.


==== Forests in British Columbia ====
In Canada, forests cover about 10% of the land area and yet harbor 70% of the country’s bird and terrestrial mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of vertebrate species in up to twelve different forest types in British Columbia. Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are able to use the burned areas. The change in forest fire intensity over time has been studied for the period since 1600 in an area of central British Columbia and is consistent with fire suppression since regulation was introduced.


=== Shrublands ===

Shrub fires typically concentrate in the canopy and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together. Shrublands are typically dry and are prone to accumulations of highly volatile fuels, especially on hillsides. Fires will follow the path of least moisture and the greatest amount of dead fuel material. Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during a burn are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly. Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include manzanita, chamise and coyote brush.


==== California shrublands ====
California shrubland, commonly known as chaparral, is a widespread plant community of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the California Coast Ranges or western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. There are a number of common shrubs and tree shrub forms in this association, including salal, toyon, coffeeberry and Western poison oak. Regeneration following a fire is usually a major factor in the association of these species.


==== South African Fynbos shrublands ====
Fynbos shrublands occur in a small belt across South Africa. The plant species in this ecosystem are highly diverse, yet the majority of these species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have coevolved into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils. Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid evolution and speciation in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.


=== Grasslands ===
Grasslands burn more readily than forest and shrub ecosystems, with the fire moving through the stems and leaves of herbaceous plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of decomposition, making it crucial in the recycling of nutrients. In some grassland systems, fire only became the primary mode of decomposition after the disappearance of large migratory herds of browsing or grazing megafauna driven by predator pressure. In the absence of functional communities of large migratory herds of herbivorous megafauna and attendant predators, overuse of fire to maintain grassland ecosystems may lead to excessive oxidation, loss of carbon, and desertification in susceptible climates. Some grassland ecosystems respond poorly to fire.


==== North American grasslands ====
In North America fire-adapted invasive grasses such as Bromus tectorum contribute to increased fire frequency which exerts selective pressure against native species. This is a concern for grasslands in the Western United States.
In less arid grassland presettlement fires worked in concert with grazing to create a healthy grassland ecosystem as indicated by the accumulation of soil organic matter significantly altered by fire. The tallgrass prairie ecosystem in the Flint Hills of eastern Kansas and Oklahoma is responding positively to the current use of fire in combination with grazing.


==== South African savanna ====
In the savanna of South Africa, recently burned areas have new growth that provides palatable and nutritious forage compared to older, tougher grasses. This new forage attracts large herbivores from areas of unburned and grazed grassland that has been kept short by constant grazing. On these unburned ""lawns"", only those plant species adapted to heavy grazing are able to persist; but the distraction provided by the newly burned areas allows grazing-intolerant grasses to grow back into the lawns that have been temporarily abandoned, so allowing these species to persist within that ecosystem.


=== Longleaf pine savannas ===

Much of the southeastern United States was once open longleaf pine forest with a rich understory of grasses, sedges, carnivorous plants and orchids. These ecosystems had the highest fire frequency of any habitat, once per decade or less. Without fire, deciduous forest trees invade, and their shade eliminates both the pines and the understory.  Some of the typical plants associated with fire include yellow pitcher plant and rose pogonia. The abundance and diversity of such plants is closely related to fire frequency. Rare animals such as gopher tortoises and indigo snakes also depend upon these open grasslands and flatwoods.  Hence, the restoration of fire is a priority to maintain species composition and biological diversity.


=== Fire in wetlands ===
Many kinds of wetlands are also influenced by fire.
This usually occurs during periods of drought.
In landscapes with peat soils, such as bogs, the peat substrate itself may burn, leaving holes that refill with water as new ponds.
Fires that are less intense will remove accumulated litter and allow other wetland plants to regenerate from buried seeds, or from rhizomes.
Wetlands that are influenced by fire include coastal marshes, wet prairies, peat bogs, floodplains, prairie marshes and flatwoods.
Since wetlands can store large amounts of carbon in peat, the fire frequency of vast northern peatlands is linked to processes controlling the carbon dioxide levels of the atmosphere, and to the phenomenon of global warming.
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is abundant in wetlands and plays a critical role in their ecology. In the Florida Everglades, a significant portion of the DOC is ""dissolved charcoal"" indicating that fire can play a critical role in wetland ecosystems.


== Fire suppression ==

Fire serves many important functions within fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire plays an important role in nutrient cycling, diversity maintenance and habitat structure. The suppression of fire can lead to unforeseen changes in ecosystems that often adversely affect the plants, animals and humans that depend upon that habitat. Wildfires that deviate from a historical fire regime because of fire suppression are called ""uncharacteristic fires"".


=== Chaparral communities ===

In 2003, southern California witnessed powerful chaparral wildfires. Hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from eight years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads, a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case. Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and ecologists.
One consequence of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of invasive and non-native plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those that had already been burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the selective pressures on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.


=== Fish impacts ===
The Boise National Forest is a US national forest located north and east of the city of Boise, Idaho. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on fish populations was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated fish populations. In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing hydraulic changes that increase flooding and lead to silt removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire populations of the fish that are able to recolonize these improved areas.


== Fire as a management tool ==

Restoration ecology is the name given to an attempt to reverse or mitigate some of the changes that humans have caused to an ecosystem. Controlled burning is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to what land managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether it be pre-human or pre-European conditions. Native American use of fire, along with natural fire, historically maintained the diversity of the savannas of North America.


=== The Great Plains shortgrass prairie ===

A combination of heavy livestock grazing and fire-suppression has drastically altered the structure, composition, and diversity of the shortgrass prairie ecosystem on the Great Plains, allowing woody species to dominate many areas and promoting fire-intolerant invasive species. In semi-arid ecosystems where the decomposition of woody material is slow, fire is crucial for returning nutrients to the soil and allowing the grasslands to maintain their high productivity.
Although fire can occur during the growing or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most effective at increasing the grass and forb cover, biodiversity and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies. Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire if they want to restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.


=== Mixed conifer forests in the US Sierra Nevada ===
Mixed conifer forests in the United States Sierra Nevada used to have fire return intervals that ranged from 5 years up to 300 years, depending on the locale. Lower elevations tended to have more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter sites saw longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at higher elevations was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer.


=== Finnish boreal forests ===
The decline of habitat area and quality has caused many species populations to be red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to a study on forest management of Finnish boreal forests, improving the habitat quality of areas outside reserves can help in conservation efforts of endangered deadwood-dependent beetles. These beetles and various types of fungi both need dead trees in order to survive. Old growth forests can provide this particular habitat. However, most Fennoscandian boreal forested areas are used for timber and therefore are unprotected. The use of controlled burning and tree retention of a forested area with deadwood was studied and its effect on the endangered beetles. The study found that after the first year of management the number of species increased in abundance and richness compared to pre-fire treatment. The abundance of beetles continued to increase the following year in sites where tree retention was high and deadwood was abundant. The correlation between forest fire management and increased beetle populations shows a key to conserving these red-listed species.


=== Australian eucalypt forests ===
Much of the old growth eucalypt forest in Australia is designated for conservation. Management of these forests is important because species like Eucalyptus grandis rely on fire to survive. There are a few eucalypt species that do not have a lignotuber, a root swelling structure that contains buds where new shoots can then sprout. During a fire a lignotuber is helpful in the reestablishment of the plant. Because some eucalypts do not have this particular mechanism, forest fire management can be helpful by creating rich soil, killing competitors, and allowing seeds to be released.

Sculpture,"Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. Sculpture is the three-dimensional art work which is physically presented in the dimensions of height, width and depth. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast.
Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost.
Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries, large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa.
The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's statue of David. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished artworks.


== Types ==

A distinction exists between sculpture ""in the round"", free-standing sculpture such as statues, not attached except possibly at the base to any other surface, and the various types of relief, which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief, high relief, and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief. Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt. Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round, and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much pottery, metalwork and jewellery. Relief sculpture may also decorate steles, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.
Another basic distinction is between subtractive carving techniques, which remove material from an existing block or lump, for example of stone or wood, and modelling techniques which shape or build up the work from the material. Techniques such as casting, stamping and moulding use an intermediate matrix containing the design to produce the work; many of these allow the production of several copies.
The term ""sculpture"" is often used mainly to describe large works, which are sometimes called monumental sculpture, meaning either or both of sculpture that is large, or that is attached to a building. But the term properly covers many types of small works in three dimensions using the same techniques, including coins and medals, hardstone carvings, a term for small carvings in stone that can take detailed work.
The very large or ""colossal"" statue has had an enduring appeal since antiquity; the largest on record at 182 m (597 ft) is the 2018 Indian Statue of Unity. Another grand form of portrait sculpture is the equestrian statue of a rider on horse, which has become rare in recent decades. The smallest forms of life-size portrait sculpture are the ""head"", showing just that, or the bust, a representation of a person from the chest up. Small forms of sculpture include the figurine, normally a statue that is no more than 18 inches (46 cm) tall, and for reliefs the plaquette, medal or coin.
Modern and contemporary art have added a number of non-traditional forms of sculpture, including sound sculpture, light sculpture, environmental art, environmental sculpture, street art sculpture, kinetic sculpture (involving aspects of physical motion), land art, and site-specific art. Sculpture is an important form of public art. A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a sculpture garden. There is also a view that buildings are a type of sculpture, with Constantin Brâncuși describing architecture as ""inhabited sculpture"". 


== Purposes and subjects ==

One of the most common purposes of sculpture is in some form of association with religion. Cult images are common in many cultures, though they are often not the colossal statues of deities which characterized ancient Greek art, like the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. The actual cult images in the innermost sanctuaries of Egyptian temples, of which none have survived, were evidently rather small, even in the largest temples. The same is often true in Hinduism, where the very simple and ancient form of the lingam is the most common. Buddhism brought the sculpture of religious figures to East Asia, where there seems to have been no earlier equivalent tradition, though again simple shapes like the bi and cong probably had religious significance.
Small sculptures as personal possessions go back to the earliest prehistoric art, and the use of very large sculpture as public art, especially to impress the viewer with the power of a ruler, goes back at least to the Great Sphinx of some 4,500 years ago. In archaeology and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of large or monumental sculpture in a culture is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;
The totem pole is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology. The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization. Recent unexpected discoveries of ancient Chinese Bronze Age figures at Sanxingdui, some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.
Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the Indus Valley civilization, appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals. The Mississippian culture seems to have been progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed. Other cultures, such as ancient Egypt and the Easter Island culture, seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage.
The collecting of sculpture, including that of earlier periods, goes back some 2,000 years in Greece, China and Mesoamerica, and many collections were available on semi-public display long before the modern museum was invented. From the 20th century the relatively restricted range of subjects found in large sculpture expanded greatly, with abstract subjects and the use or representation of any type of subject now common. Today much sculpture is made for intermittent display in galleries and museums, and the ability to transport and store the increasingly large works is a factor in their construction.
Small decorative figurines, most often in ceramics, are as popular today (though strangely neglected by modern and Contemporary art) as they were in the Rococo, or in ancient Greece when Tanagra figurines were a major industry, or in East Asian and Pre-Columbian art. Small sculpted fittings for furniture and other objects go well back into antiquity, as in the Nimrud ivories, Begram ivories and finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.
Portrait sculpture began in Egypt, where the Narmer Palette shows a ruler of the 32nd century BCE, and Mesopotamia, where we have 27 surviving statues of Gudea, who ruled Lagash c. 2144–2124 BCE. In ancient Greece and Rome, the erection of a portrait statue in a public place was almost the highest mark of honour, and the ambition of the elite, who might also be depicted on a coin.
In other cultures such as Egypt and the Near East public statues were almost exclusively the preserve of the ruler, with other wealthy people only being portrayed in their tombs. Rulers are typically the only people given portraits in Pre-Columbian cultures, beginning with the Olmec colossal heads of about 3,000 years ago. East Asian portrait sculpture was entirely religious, with leading clergy being commemorated with statues, especially the founders of monasteries, but not rulers, or ancestors. The Mediterranean tradition revived, initially only for tomb effigies and coins, in the Middle Ages, but expanded greatly in the Renaissance, which invented new forms such as the personal portrait medal.
Animals are, with the human figure, the earliest subject for sculpture, and have always been popular, sometimes realistic, but often imaginary monsters; in China animals and monsters are almost the only traditional subjects for stone sculpture outside tombs and temples. The kingdom of plants is important only in jewellery and decorative reliefs, but these form almost all the large sculpture of Byzantine art and Islamic art, and are very important in most Eurasian traditions, where motifs such as the palmette and vine scroll have passed east and west for over two millennia.
One form of sculpture found in many prehistoric cultures around the world is specially enlarged versions of ordinary tools, weapons or vessels created in impractical precious materials, for either some form of ceremonial use or display or as offerings. Jade or other types of greenstone were used in China, Olmec Mexico, and Neolithic Europe, and in early Mesopotamia large pottery shapes were produced in stone. Bronze was used in Europe and China for large axes and blades, like the Oxborough Dirk.


== Materials and techniques ==

The materials used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially bronze, stone and pottery, with wood, bone and antler less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as gold, silver, jade, and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak, box/boxwood, and lime/linden); terracotta and other ceramics, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of cylinder seals and engraved gems), and cast metals such as pewter and zinc (spelter). But a vast number of other materials have been used as part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones.
Sculptures are often painted, but commonly lose their paint to time, or restorers. Many different painting techniques have been used in making sculpture, including tempera, oil painting, gilding, house paint, aerosol, enamel and sandblasting.
Many sculptors seek new ways and materials to make art. One of Pablo Picasso's most famous sculptures included bicycle parts. Alexander Calder and other modernists made spectacular use of painted steel. Since the 1960s, acrylics and other plastics have been used as well. Andy Goldsworthy makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings. Some sculpture, such as ice sculpture, sand sculpture, and gas sculpture, is deliberately short-lived. Recent sculptors have used stained glass, tools, machine parts, hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works. Sculptors sometimes use found objects, and Chinese scholar's rocks have been appreciated for many centuries.


=== Stone ===

Stone sculpture is an ancient activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged in some form of stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains in situ, by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way. Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, originally used as seal rings.
The copying of an original statue in stone, which was very important for ancient Greek statues, which are nearly all known from copies, was traditionally achieved by ""pointing"", along with more freehand methods. Pointing involved setting up a grid of string squares on a wooden frame surrounding the original, and then measuring the position on the grid and the distance between grid and statue of a series of individual points, and then using this information to carve into the block from which the copy is made.


=== Metal ===

Bronze and related copper alloys are the oldest and still the most popular metals for cast metal sculptures; a cast bronze sculpture is often called simply a ""bronze"". Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Their strength and lack of brittleness (ductility) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various ceramic or stone materials (see marble sculpture for several examples). Gold is the softest and most precious metal, and very important in jewellery; with silver it is soft enough to be worked with hammers and other tools as well as cast; repoussé and chasing are among the techniques used in gold and silversmithing.
Casting is a group of manufacturing processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process, although a final stage of ""cold work"" may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BCE. Specific techniques include lost-wax casting, plaster mould casting, and sand casting.
Welding is a process where different pieces of metal are fused together to create different shapes and designs. There are many different forms of welding, such as Oxy-fuel welding, Stick welding, MIG welding, and TIG welding. Oxy-fuel is probably the most common method of welding when it comes to creating steel sculptures because it is the easiest to use for shaping the steel as well as making clean and less noticeable joins of the steel. The key to Oxy-fuel welding is heating each piece of metal to be joined evenly until all are red and have a shine to them. Once that shine is on each piece, that shine will soon become a 'pool' where the metal is liquified and the welder must get the pools to join, fusing the metal. Once cooled off, the location where the pools joined are now one continuous piece of metal. Also used heavily in Oxy-fuel sculpture creation is forging. Forging is the process of heating metal to a certain point to soften it enough to be shaped into different forms. One very common example is heating the end of a steel rod and hitting the red heated tip with a hammer while on an anvil to form a point. In between hammer swings, the forger rotates the rod and gradually forms a sharpened point from the blunt end of a steel rod.


=== Glass ===

Glass may be used for sculpture through a wide range of working techniques, though the use of it for large works is a recent development. It can be carved, though with considerable difficulty; the Roman Lycurgus Cup is all but unique.  There are various ways of moulding glass: hot casting can be done by ladling molten glass into moulds that have been created by pressing shapes into sand, carved graphite or detailed plaster/silica moulds. Kiln casting glass involves heating chunks of glass in a kiln until they are liquid and flow into a waiting mould below it in the kiln.  Hot glass can also be blown and/or hot sculpted with hand tools either as a solid mass or as part of a blown object. More recent techniques involve chiseling and bonding plate glass with polymer silicates and UV light.


=== Pottery ===

Pottery is one of the oldest materials for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small preliminary works called maquettes of ephemeral materials such as plaster of Paris, wax, unfired clay, or plasticine.  Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small figurines have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture. Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from ancient Rome and Mesopotamia to China.


=== Wood carving ===

Wood carving has been extremely widely practiced, but survives much less well than the other main materials, being vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures.  Outdoor wood sculpture does not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed. Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions.
Wood is light, so suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be carried, and can take very fine detail. It is also much easier to work than stone.  It has been very often painted after carving, but the paint wears less well than the wood, and is often missing in surviving pieces.  Painted wood is often technically described as ""wood and polychrome"".  Typically a layer of gesso or plaster is applied to the wood, and then the paint is applied to that.


=== Soft materials ===
Three dimensional work incorporating unconventional materials such as cloth, fur, plastics, rubber and nylon, that can thus be stuffed, sewn, hung, draped or woven, are known as soft sculptures. Well known creators of soft sculptures include Claes Oldenburg, Yayoi Kusama, Eva Hesse, Sarah Lucas and Magdalena Abakanowicz.


== Social status of sculptors ==

Worldwide, sculptors have usually been tradespeople whose work is unsigned; in some traditions, for example China, where sculpture did not share the prestige of literati painting, this has affected the status of sculpture itself. Even in ancient Greece, where sculptors such as Phidias became famous, they appear to have retained much the same social status as other artisans, and perhaps not much greater financial rewards, although some signed their works.  In the Middle Ages artists such as the 12th-century Gislebertus sometimes signed their work, and were sought after by different cities, especially from the Trecento onwards in Italy, with figures such as Arnolfo di Cambio, and Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni. Goldsmiths and jewellers, dealing with precious materials and often doubling as bankers, belonged to powerful guilds and had considerable status, often holding civic office. Many sculptors also practised in other arts; Andrea del Verrocchio also painted, and Giovanni Pisano, Michelangelo, and Jacopo Sansovino were architects. Some sculptors maintained large workshops. Even in the Renaissance the physical nature of the work was perceived by Leonardo da Vinci and others as pulling down the status of sculpture in the arts, though the reputation of Michelangelo perhaps put this long-held idea to rest.
From the High Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo, Leone Leoni and Giambologna could become wealthy, and ennobled, and enter the circle of princes, after a period of sharp argument over the relative status of sculpture and painting.  Much decorative sculpture on buildings remained a trade, but sculptors producing individual pieces were recognised on a level with painters. From the 18th century or earlier sculpture also attracted middle-class students, although it was slower to do so than painting. Women sculptors took longer to appear than women painters, and were less prominent until the 20th century.


== Anti-sculpture movements ==
Aniconism originated with Judaism, which did not accept figurative sculpture until the 19th century, before expanding to Christianity, which initially accepted large sculptures. In Christianity and Buddhism, sculpture became very significant. Christian Eastern Orthodoxy has never accepted monumental sculpture, and Islam has consistently rejected nearly all figurative sculpture, except for very small figures in reliefs and some animal figures that fulfill a useful function, like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the Alhambra. Many forms of Protestantism also do not approve of religious sculpture. There has been much iconoclasm of sculpture for religious motives, from the Early Christians and the Beeldenstorm of the Protestant Reformation to the 2001 destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan by the Taliban.


== History ==


=== Prehistoric periods ===


==== Europe ====
The earliest undisputed examples of sculpture belong to the Aurignacian culture, which was located in Europe and southwest Asia and active at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic. As well as producing some of the earliest known cave art, the people of this culture developed finely-crafted stone tools, manufacturing pendants, bracelets, ivory beads, and bone-flutes, as well as three-dimensional figurines.
The 30 cm tall Löwenmensch found in the Hohlenstein Stadel area of Germany is an anthropomorphic lion-human figure carved from woolly mammoth ivory. It has been dated to about 35–40,000 BP, making it, along with the Venus of Hohle Fels, the oldest known uncontested examples of sculpture.
Much surviving prehistoric art is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female Venus figurines such as the Venus of Willendorf (24–26,000 BP) found across central Europe.  The Swimming Reindeer of about 13,000 years ago is one of the finest of a number of Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in the art of the Upper Paleolithic, although they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture. Two of the largest prehistoric sculptures can be found at the Tuc d'Audobert caves in France, where around 12–17,000 years ago a masterful sculptor used a spatula-like stone tool and fingers to model a pair of large bison in clay against a limestone rock.
With the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced, and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot.


==== Ancient Near East ====
From the ancient Near East, the over-life sized stone Urfa Man from modern Turkey comes from about 9,000 BCE, and the 'Ain Ghazal Statues from around 7200 and 6500 BCE.  These are from modern Jordan, made of lime plaster and reeds, and about half life-size; there are 15 statues, some with two heads side by side, and 15 busts.  Small clay figures of people and animals are found at many sites across the Near East from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, and represent the start of a more-or-less continuous tradition in the region.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Ancient Near East ===

The Protoliterate period in Mesopotamia, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals. The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000–2800 BCE, part human and part lioness. A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived.  Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men. Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at Ur (c. 2650 BCE), including the two figures of a Ram in a Thicket, the Copper Bull and a bull's head on one of the Lyres of Ur.
From the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BCE, Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not. The Burney Relief is an unusually elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15 inches, 50 x 37 cm) terracotta plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions. It comes from the 18th or 19th century BCE, and may also be moulded. Stone stelae, votive offerings, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them; the fragmentary Stele of the Vultures is an early example of the inscribed type, and the Assyrian Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III a large and solid late one.
The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire. Unlike earlier states, the Assyrians could use easily carved stone from northern Iraq, and did so in great quantity.  The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection, including the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal and the Lachish reliefs showing a campaign. They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures of the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete). Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Ancient Egypt ===

The monumental sculpture of ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers. The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of sunk relief, which is well suited to very bright sunlight. The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 ""fists"" to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead. This appears as early as the Narmer Palette from Dynasty I. However, there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses.  Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones. Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BCE, and with the exception of the art of the Amarna period of Ahkenaten, and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest.
Egyptian pharaohs were always regarded as deities, but other deities are much less common in large statues, except when they represent the pharaoh as another deity; however the other deities are frequently shown in paintings and reliefs. The famous row of four colossal statues outside the main temple at Abu Simbel each show Rameses II, a typical scheme, though here exceptionally large.  Small figures of deities, or their animal personifications, are very common, and found in popular materials such as pottery. Most larger sculpture survives from Egyptian temples or tombs; by Dynasty IV (2680–2565 BCE) at the latest the idea of the Ka statue was firmly established. These were put in tombs as a resting place for the ka portion of the soul, and so we have a good number of less conventionalized statues of well-off administrators and their wives, many in wood as Egypt is one of the few places in the world where the climate allows wood to survive over millennia. The so-called reserve heads, plain hairless heads, are especially naturalistic. Early tombs also contained small models of the slaves, animals, buildings and objects such as boats necessary for the deceased to continue his lifestyle in the afterworld, and later Ushabti figures.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Europe ===


==== Ancient Greece ====

The first distinctive style of ancient Greek sculpture developed in the Early Bronze Age Cycladic period (3rd millennium BCE), where marble figures, usually female and small, are represented in an elegantly simplified geometrical style. Most typical is a standing pose with arms crossed in front, but other figures are shown in different poses, including a complicated figure of a harpist seated on a chair.
The subsequent Minoan and Mycenaean cultures developed sculpture further, under influence from Syria and elsewhere, but it is in the later Archaic period from around 650 BCE that the kouros developed. These are large standing statues of naked youths, found in temples and tombs, with the kore as the clothed female equivalent, with elaborately dressed hair; both have the ""archaic smile"". They seem to have served a number of functions, perhaps sometimes representing deities and sometimes the person buried in a grave, as with the Kroisos Kouros. They are clearly influenced by Egyptian and Syrian styles, but the Greek artists were much more ready to experiment within the style.
During the 6th century Greek sculpture developed rapidly, becoming more naturalistic, and with much more active and varied figure poses in narrative scenes, though still within idealized conventions. Sculptured pediments were added to temples, including the Parthenon in Athens, where the remains of the pediment of around 520 using figures in the round were fortunately used as infill for new buildings after the Persian sack in 480 BCE, and recovered from the 1880s on in fresh unweathered condition. Other significant remains of architectural sculpture come from Paestum in Italy, Corfu, Delphi and the Temple of Aphaea in Aegina (much now in Munich).  Most Greek sculpture originally included at least some colour; the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark, has done extensive research and recreation of the original colours.

Debt bondage,"Bonded labour or debt bondage (or debt slavery) is a term used to refer to a situation where someone (a debtor) has to work for the person who lent him money. Generally, the conditions of this form of forced labour are close to slavery. Bonded labour is one of the most common forms of modern-day slavery-like conditions. Usually, the person working gets paid very little money in return for very hard work. Very often, the exact amount to be re-paid is not defined clearly. The person doing the bonded labour will never be able to pay off the debt through work.  
A regular work contract usually gives rights to the person being employed, and the amount of work. In a normal working contract, difficult, dangerous or exhausting work will usually get paid better. This is not the case with debt bondage. 
Debt bondage is banned by the Convention of United Nation on slavery in 1956.

ELIZA,"ELIZA is an early program able to process natural language. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to scripts. The most famous script was called DOCTOR. It was a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. Eliza didn't know much about thought or emotion. However, DOCTOR sometimes provided conversation like a human. ELIZA was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966.
When the person used words that were not in the very small list,
DOCTOR might say, for example, responding to ""My head hurts"", ""Why do you say your head hurts?"" The response to ""My mother hates me"" might be ""Who else in your family hates you?"" ELIZA was programmed using simple pattern matching techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked. It was one of the first chatterbots in existence.

Animated documentary,"The animated documentary (also known as anidoc) is a moving image form that combines animation and documentary. This form should not be confused with documentaries about movie and TV animation history that feature excerpts.


== History ==
 
The first recognized example of this genre is Winsor McCay's 1918 12-minute-long film The Sinking of the Lusitania, which uses animation to portray the 1915 sinking of RMS Lusitania after it was struck by two torpedoes launched by a German U-boat; an event of which no recorded film footage is known to exist. 
Since the 1920s, animation has been used in educational and social guidance films, and has often been used to illustrate abstract concepts in mainly live-action examples of these genres. Early examples of fully animated educational films are The Einstein Theory of Relativity and Evolution (both 1923) by Max and Dave Fleischer. Walt Disney used it in films such as Victory Through Air Power (1943), How to Catch a Cold (1951) and Our Friend the Atom (1957).
In 1953, Norman McLaren's Neighbours won the Academy Awards for Best Documentary (Short Subject). The award is somewhat considered a mistake, but the fact that it was not only indicated into that category, but also won, shows that, somehow, the animated images spoke to the judges almost like a documentary.
Of Stars and Men, a 1964 animated feature by John Hubley which tells of humankind's quest to find its place in the universe, won an award in the documentary category at the San Francisco Film Festival.
Mosaic Films promoted the use of animated documentaries in the United Kingdom in 2003 with the award-winning series Animated Minds. Commissioned by Channel 4 and directed by Andy Glynne, it uses real testimony from survivors of mental illness, combined with engaging visuals, to climb inside the minds of the mentally distressed. The first series won the award for Best Animation at the Banff World Media Festival (2004).
The 2007 International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam featured a programme of ""documentaries that partly or completely consist of animation"". In the article written to accompany the event, Kees Driessen talked about the ""least controversial"" form of the genre; the ""illustrated radio documentary"", citing Aardman Animation's 1987 film Lip Synch: Going Equipped (directed by Peter Lord) as an example. One of the most consistent creators of this form of animated documentary today is Paul Fierlinger. His films from the late 1980s-onward typically feature recordings of people talking about certain topics in their lives (such as alcohol abuse or loneliness), accompanied by Fierlinger's animation which mainly illustrates the stories in a realistic way. This is a contrast from films and series such as Aardman's Creature Comforts, which recontextualise such audio recordings by combining them with more fanciful, non-realistic animated interpretations.
Fierlinger's 1995 animated feature-length autobiography Drawn from Memory, in which he is the main subject as well as the director, voice actor and only animator, was also called a documentary by Driessen. This technique of animating interviews has also been used by other filmmakers, such as Chris Landreth in his Oscar-winning 2004 short film Ryan (mainly based on an interview done with animator Ryan Larkin) and Jonas Odell in the 2006 Swedish film Aldrig som första gången! (Never Like the First Time!, consisting of animated segments of people's descriptions of their first time engaging in sex). The film Chicago 10, about the Chicago Seven incident, received some acclaim for recreating courtroom scenes using animation. Another documentary with animated elements is the German film Neukölln Unlimited, which uses animation to depict past traumas of its protagonists.
The Oscar-nominated 2008 Israeli film Waltz with Bashir was advertised as being the first feature-length animated documentary. 
Some animated documentaries that were nominated or won for Oscars are So Much for So Little (1949), Sunrise Over Tiananmen Square (1998), The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation (2005), I Met the Walrus (2007), Last Day of Freedom (2015)  and Flee (2021).

Two-wheel drive,"Two-wheel drive (2WD) describes vehicles in which, in theory, two wheels receive power from the engine at the same time. Usually the two wheels are on the same axle in the drivetrain. Most vehicles with two-wheel drive are mainly for use on roads and highways. Two-wheel drive cars and trucks are either front- (FWD) or Rear-wheel drive (RWD). This means either the front or the rear axle is the ""drive axle"" that moves the vehicle forward. When the vehicle begins to accelerate, some of the weight of the vehicle is shifted to the rear giving a rear-wheel drive car or better balance and traction. Two-wheel drive systems are simple and rugged. This is why rear-wheel drive is so popular in police cars and other service vehicles.


== Disadvantages ==
Traditional two-wheel drive systems have a differential in the rear axle. This is used for turning the vehicle. If both drive wheels rotated at exactly the same rate, the vehicle would have difficulty going around a corner. In a turn, the outside wheel has to go faster to keep up with the inside wheel (which turns slower). A differential allows one wheel to turn faster under these conditions. This means only one of the two wheels actually has power at any given time. A differential also prevents excessive tire wear. 
Of the two drive types, RWD has more disadvantages. In wet or slippery conditions, having effectively only one drive wheel, the tires are going to slip and lose traction. A FWD (not to be confused with 4WD) vehicle will have better traction, but in snow and icy conditions will not equal a four-wheel drive car or truck.

Generative art,"Generative art is the combination of computer technology with art. It uses a system that can independently determine the features of artwork that would otherwise require the work of the artist. It can be argued that the system only reproduces the artistic intent of the creator.  It can also be argued that the system takes on the role of the creator.


== History ==
Georg Nees, one of the pioneers of the movement, in February 1965 presented a number of his works to the public in Stuttgart. They were described  as ""computer graphics"". A few years later, Nees wrote a dissertation titled ""Procedural Computer Graphics"". ""Procedural art"" and similar terms began to be used in those years by other computer artists, including Manfred Mohr. The term ""procedural art"" in the sense of ""dynamic systems of artworks capable of generating multiple artistic events"" was first proposed at the ""Procedural Art"" conference in Milan in 1998.
The term has also been used to describe geometric abstract art in which simple elements are repeated, transformed, or modified to create more complex shapes. It can be argued that in the late 1960s, the Argentine artists Eduardo McIntyre and Miguel Angel Vidal also practiced procedural art. In 1972, Paul Neagu, a native of Romania, created an association called the Generative Art Group in the UK. In 1972, Neagu gave a lecture on ""forms of generative art"" at Queen's University at the Belfast Festival.
In 1970, the Department of Procedural Systems was created at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. According to Sonya Landy Sheridan, the main focus of his staff was on artistic practices using the new technologies for capturing, printing and transmitting images, as well as exploring the aspect of time in image transformation.
In the mid-1990s, Brian Eno was also involved in the popularization of procedural music and procedural systems, which were closely associated with experimental music.

Petrified wood,"Petrified wood (from Ancient Greek πέτρα meaning 'rock' or 'stone'; literally 'wood turned into stone'), is the name given to a special type of fossilized wood, the fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. Petrifaction is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having been replaced by stone via a mineralization process that often includes permineralization and replacement. The organic materials making up cell walls have been replicated with minerals (mostly silica in the form of opal, chalcedony, or quartz). In some instances, the original structure of the stem tissue may be partially retained. Unlike other plant fossils, which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material.
The petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried in water or volcanic ash. The presence of water reduces the availability of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition by bacteria and fungi. Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediments may lead to permineralization, which occurs when minerals precipitate out of solution filling the interiors of cells and other empty spaces. During replacement, the plant's cell walls act as a template for mineralization. There needs to be a balance between the decay of cellulose and lignin and mineral templating for cellular detail to be preserved with fidelity. Most of the organic matter often decomposes, however some of the lignin may remain. Silica in the form of opal-A, can encrust and permeate wood relatively quickly in hot spring environments. However, petrified wood is most commonly associated with trees that were buried in fine grained sediments of deltas and floodplains or volcanic lahars and ash beds. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.


== Formation ==

Petrified wood forms when woody stems of plants are buried in wet sediments saturated with dissolved minerals. The lack of oxygen slows decay of the wood, allowing minerals to replace cell walls and to fill void spaces in the wood.
Wood is composed mostly of holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) and lignin. Together, these substances make up 95% of the dry composition of wood. Almost half of this is cellulose, which gives wood much of its strength. Cellulose is composed of long chains of polymerized glucose arranged into microfibrils that reinforce the cell walls in the wood. Hemicellulose, a branched polymer of various simple sugars, makes up the majority of the remaining composition of hardwood while lignin, which is a polymer of phenylpropanes, is more abundant in softwood. The hemicellulose and lignin encrust and reinforce the cellulose microfibrils.
Dead wood is normally rapidly decomposed by microorganisms, beginning with the holocellulose. The lignin is hydrophobic (water-repelling) and much slower to decay. The rate of decay is affected by temperature and moisture content, but exclusion of oxygen is the most important factor preserving wood tissue: Organisms that decompose lignin must have oxygen for their life processes. As a result, fossil wood older than Eocene (about 56 million years old or older) has lost almost all its holocellulose, and only lignin remains. In addition to microbial decomposition, wood buried in an alkaline environment is rapidly broken down by inorganic reactions with the alkali.
Wood is preserved from decomposition by rapid entombment in mud, particularly mud formed from volcanic ash. The wood is then mineralized to transform it to stone. Non-mineralized wood has been recovered from Paleozoic formations, particularly Callixylon from Berea Sandstone, but this is very unusual. The petrified wood is later exposed by erosion of surrounding sediments. Non-mineralized fossil wood is rapidly destroyed when exposed by erosion, but petrified wood is quite durable.
Some 40 minerals have been identified in petrified wood, but silica minerals are by far the most important. Calcite and pyrite are much less common, and others are quite rare. Silica binds to the cellulose in cell walls via hydrogen bonding and forms a kind of template. Additional silica then replaces the cellulose as it decomposes, so that cell walls are often preserved in great detail. Thus silicification begins within the cell walls, and the spaces within and between cells are filled with silica more gradually. Over time, almost all the original organic material is lost; only around 10% remains in the petrified wood. The remaining material is nearly pure silica, with only iron, aluminum, and alkali and alkaline earth elements present in more than trace amounts. Iron, calcium, aluminum are the most common, and one or more of these elements may make up more than 1% of the composition.
Just what form the silica initially takes is still a topic of research. There is evidence of initial deposition as opal, which then crystallizes to quartz over long time periods. On the other hand, there is some evidence that silica is deposited directly as quartz.
Wood can become silicified very rapidly in silica-rich hot springs. While wood petrified in this setting is only a minor part of the geologic record, hot spring deposits are important to paleontologists because such deposits sometimes preserve more delicate plant parts in exquisite detail. These Lagerstätte deposits include the Paleozoic Rhynie Chert and East Kirkton Limestone beds, which record early stages in the evolution of land plants.
Most of the color in petrified wood comes from trace metals. Of these, iron is the most important, and it can produce a range of hues depending on its oxidation state.  Chromium produces bright green petrified wood. Variations in color likely reflect different episodes of mineralization. In some cases, variations may come from chromatographic separation of trace metals.
Wood can also be petrified by calcite, as occurs in concretions in coal beds. Wood petrified by calcite tends to retain more of its original organic material. Petrification begins with deposition of goethite in the cell walls, followed by deposition of calcite in the void spaces. Carbonized wood is resistant to silicification and is usually petrified by other minerals. Wood petrified by minerals other than silica minerals tends to accumulate heavy metals, such as uranium, selenium, and germanium, with uranium most common in wood high in lignin and germanium most common in wood preserved in coal beds. Boron, zinc, and phosphorus are anomalously low in fossil wood, suggesting they are leached away or scavenged by microorganisms.
Less commonly, the replacement minerals in petrified wood are chalcocite or other sulfide minerals. These have been mined as copper ore at locations such as the Nacimiento Mine near Cuba, New Mexico.


=== Simulated petrified wood ===
Scientists have attempted to duplicate the process of petrification of wood, both to better understand the natural petrification process and for its possible use as a ceramic material. Early attempts used sodium metasilicate as a source of silica, but tetraethyl orthosilicate has proven more promising.


== Uses ==

Petrified wood has limited use in jewelry, but is mostly used for decorative pieces such as book ends, table tops, clock faces, or other ornamental objects.  A number of Ancestral Puebloan structures near Petrified Forest National Park were constructed of petrified wood, including the Agate House Pueblo. Petrified wood is also used in New Age healing.


== Occurrences ==
Petrified wood is found worldwide in sedimentary beds ranging in age from the Devonian (about 390 million years ago), when woody plants first appeared on dry land, to nearly the present. Petrified ""forests"" tend to be either entire ecosystems buried by volcanic eruptions, in which trunks often remain in their growth positions, or accumulations of drift wood in fluvial environments. Amethyst Ridge at Yellowstone National Park shows 27 successive forest ecosystems buried by eruptions, while Petrified Forest National Park is a particularly fine example of fluvial accumulations of driftwood.
Volcanic ash is particularly suitable for preservation of wood, because large quantities of silica are released as the ash weathers. The presence of petrified wood in a sedimentary bed is often an indication of the presence of weathered volcanic ash. Petrified wood can also form in arkosic sediments, rich in feldspar and other minerals that release silica as they break down. The warm supermonsoon climates of the Carboniferous through Permian periods seem to have favored this process. Preservation of petrified forests in volcanic ash beds is less affected by climate and preserves a greater diversity of species.

Integrated development environment,"An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a computer program that makes it easier to write other computer programs. They are used by computer programmers to edit source code, and can be easier to use than other text editors for new programmers. They can have compilers so programmers don't have to open other programs to compile the source code. They also often have syntax highlighting. A feature of an IDE is to check the syntax, and libraries can be added to increase functionality. It also may have predictive coding that can finish lines with syntax such as brackets or semicolons and can suggest variables to be used. It also may have debuggers that can step through lines, take breaks and inspect variables.
An IDE often comes with an interpreter and a compiler. Certain IDEs can allow multi-language which means that functions can be written in different languages.",0
Medical tourism,"Medical Tourism is when patients visit other countries for medical care. The patients usually come from developed countries to find treatment at lower prices. Over 50 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry.
Examples of common medical procedures done for medical tourists are surgeries like joint replacement, heart surgery, cosmetic surgery, weight loss, dental treatment, and addictions rehabilitation (or recovery from addiction).


== Etymology ==
The term medical tourism can also be called medical travel, health tourism or global healthcare. It was initially developed by travel agencies and the mass media to describe the rapidly-growing practice of travelling across international borders to obtain health care.mainly it is for curing people and a lot of countries believe on this.


== Countries ==
Countries that are popular for Medical Tourism are:

Canada
Cuba
Thailand
India
Singapore
Brazil
Mexico
Taiwan
turkey
somalia


== Cost savings ==
To get an idea of the potential cost savings from medical tourism, in Denver, Colorado, USA, a person without health insurance who needs a hip replacement will pay about US $60,000 (EUR 44751). In comparison, in Cuba, going through medical tourism firm Choice Medical Services, the same procedure costs about US $8000 (EUR 5967) or about an 80 percent savings.


== Risks ==
People who are obese may get medical treatment to lose weight.  In Britain there are long waiting lists for weight loss surgery. It is very easy to get this surgery in Turkey.   Seven Britons have died after having weight loss surgery there since 2019 and many more have had serious problems.

Monetization,"Monetization (also spelled monetisation in the UK) is, broadly speaking, the process of converting something into money. The term has a broad range of uses. In banking, the term refers to the process of converting or establishing something into legal tender. While it usually refers to the coining of currency or the printing of banknotes by central banks, it may also take the form of a promissory currency. The term ""monetization"" may also be used informally to refer to exchanging possessions for cash or cash equivalents, including selling a security interest, charging fees for something that used to be free, or attempting to make money on goods or services that were previously unprofitable or had been considered to have the potential to earn profits. And data monetization refers to a spectrum of ways information assets can be converted into economic value.
Another meaning of ""monetization"" denotes the process by which the U.S. Treasury accounts for the face value of outstanding coinage.  This procedure can extend even to one-of-a-kind situations such as when the Treasury Department sold an extremely rare 1933 Double Eagle. The coin's nominal value of $20 was added to the final sale price, reflecting the fact that the coin was considered to have been issued into circulation as a result of the transaction. In some industry sectors such as high technology and marketing, monetization is a buzzword for adapting non-revenue-generating assets to generate revenue.


== Promissory currency ==
Such commodities as gold, diamonds, and emeralds have generally been regarded by human populations as having an intrinsic value within that population based on their rarity or quality and thus provide a premium not associated with fiat currency unless that currency is ""promissory"". That is, the currency promises to deliver a given amount of a recognized commodity of a universally (globally) agreed-to rarity and value, providing the currency with the foundation of legitimacy or value. Though rarely the case with paper currency, even intrinsically relatively worthless items or commodities can be made into money, so long as they are challenging to make or acquire.


== Debt monetization ==

Debt monetization is the financing of government spending by the central bank. If a nation's expenditure exceeds its revenues, it incurs a government deficit which can be financed either:

by the government treasury, by way of
money it already holds (e.g. income or liquidations from a sovereign wealth fund); or
issuing new bonds; or
by the central bank, through money it creates de novo
In the latter case, the central bank may purchase government bonds by conducting an open market purchase, i.e. by increasing the monetary base through the money creation process. If government bonds that have come due are held by the central bank, the central bank will return any funds paid to it back to the treasury. Thus, the treasury may ""borrow"" money without needing to repay it. This process of financing government spending is called ""monetizing the debt"".
In most high-income countries the government assigns exclusive power to issue its national currency to a central bank, but central banks may be forbidden by law from purchasing debt directly from the government. For example, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (article 123) forbids EU central banks' direct purchase of debt of EU public bodies such as national governments.


== Revenue from business operations ==
Web sites and mobile apps that generate revenue are often monetized via online advertisements, subscription fees, or (in the case of apps) in-app purchases. In the music industry, monetization is achieved by placing ads before, after, or in the middle of content on a platform that supports this or posting the music on on-demand apps like Spotify and Apple Music. On-demand content sites like Spotify and Apple Music pay the artist a percentage of the monthly subscription fees they receive from their users. To put release music on streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music, an artist has to reach out to a distributor like TuneCore or Distrokid. They are the one who do make the music available on streaming sites. This is usually done for a percentage of the revenue generation. For each public viewing, the advertising revenue is shared with the artist or others who hold rights to the video content. A previously free product may have premium options added thus becoming freemium.
Businesses monetize their value propositions to generate the resources necessary for continued operation through a business model or revenue model. Failure to monetize websites due to an inadequate revenue model was a problem that caused many businesses to fold during the dot-com bust.
Equally, David Sands, CTO for Citibank Equity Research, affirmed that failure to achieve monetization of the Research Analysts' models as the reason the de-bundling of Equity Research has never taken hold.
On the other hand, aggressive monetization refers to how a firm or business is overemphasizing the process of making money at the cost of the user's well-being. The over-emphasis generate equal resistance from the users due to perceived unfairness and psychological reactance.


== Monetization of non-monetary benefits ==
Monetization is also used to refer to the process of converting some benefit received in non-monetary form (such as milk) into a monetary payment. The term is used in social welfare reform when converting in-kind payments (such as food stamps or other free benefits) into some ""equivalent"" cash payment. From the point of view of economics and efficiency, it is usually considered better to give someone a monetary equivalent of some benefit than the benefit (say, a liter of milk) in kind.

Inefficiency: in the latter situation people who may not need milk cannot get something of equivalent value (without subsequently trading or selling the milk).
Black market growth: people who need something other than milk may sell it. In many circumstances, this action may be illegal and considered fraudulent. For example, Moscow pensioners (see below for details) often give their personal cards that allow free usage of local transport to relatives who use public transport more frequently.
Changes on the market: supply of milk to the market is reduced by the amount distributed to the privileged group, so the price and availability of milk may change.
Corruption: firms that should give this benefit have an advantage as they have guaranteed consumers and the quality of the goods supplied is controlled only administratively, not by market competition. So, bribes to the body that choose such firms and/or maintain control can take place.


=== Russian social welfare monetization of 2005 ===

In 2005, Russia transformed most of its in-kind benefits into monetary compensation.
Before this reform there was a large system of preferences: free/reduced price of travels on local transport, free supply of drugs, free health resort treatment, etc. for diverse categories of society: military personnel, the disabled, and separately, persons disabled due to World War II, Chernobyl liquidators, inhabitants of Leningrad during the siege, former political prisoners, and for all pensioners (that is, women 55+, men 60+). This system was a legacy of the Soviet Union, but it was heavily extended by populist laws passed by central and regional authorities during the 1990s.

By the law 122-ФЗ of 22 August 2004, this system was converted into cash payments by various means:

abolition of preference, compensated by raising of wage (e.g. free use of local transport for military personnel) or pension (e.g. different preferences for Chernobyl liquidators)
for the three most important preferences (free local transport, 50%-price suburban rail transport, free supply of drugs): a choice between the preference and some extra money.
The main causes of friction in the reform were the following:

technical and bureaucratic problems (e.g. for usage of the 50% discount for suburban rail transport, a person would need to present a paper from the local State Pension Fund office stating that he/she doesn't choose monetary compensation);
separation of all preference-recipients into federal and regional according to the body authorizing the preference. The largest group – pensioners – was regional, and this caused most of the problems:
In poor regions, financial pressure caused the local government to abolish these preferences with little or no compensation to the former recipients.
Even if the preferences were retained, they would apply only to pensioners of the region in question. Thus, pensioners from the Moscow Oblast (administrative region), for example, could not freely use the metro and buses in Moscow proper, because these are two different local governments. Later, most of these problems would be solved by a series of bi-lateral agreements between neighboring regions.
A wave of protests emerged in various parts of Russia in the beginning of 2005 as this law started to take effect. The government responded with measures that eventually addressed the most pressing of the protesters' concerns (raising of compensations, normalization of bureaucratic mechanisms, etc.).
The long-term effects of the monetization reform varied for different groups. Some people received compensation in excess of the services they had previously received (e.g. in rural areas without any local transport, the free transport benefit was of little value), while others found the compensation to be insufficient to cover the cost of the benefits they had previously depended on. Transport companies and railroads have benefitted from monetization as they now collect higher revenue from the use their services by pensioners who had previously ridden at the government's expense. (In some regions, more than half of the passengers formerly did not pay for municipal transport, but the government did not compensate the transport companies for the full fare of these passengers.) Effects on the medical system are controversial. Doctors and nurses have to fill out many forms in order to receive compensation from the government for services provided to pensioners, thus reducing the time that they have to provide medical services.


=== United States agricultural policy ===
In United States agricultural policy, ""monetization"" is a P.L. 480 provision (section 203) first included in the Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99–198) that allows private voluntary organizations and cooperatives to sell a percentage of donated P.L. 480 commodities in the recipient country or in countries in the same region.  Under section 203, private voluntary organizations or cooperatives are permitted to sell (i.e., monetize) for local currencies or dollars an amount of commodities equal to not less than 15% of the total amount of commodities distributed in any fiscal year in a country.  The currency generated by these sales can then be used:  to finance internal transportation, storage, or distribution of commodities; to implement development projects; or to invest and with the interest earned used to finance distribution costs or projects.

Environmental art,"Environmental art is a form of avant-garde contemporary art. It includes different types of artistic practices that involve nature, ecology, and social issues.
It has changed over time, moving away from focusing on formal aspects, like using earth for large sculptures, and now explores deeper connections with natural systems, processes, and social concerns.
In recent years, environmental art has gained significant attention and is often featured in exhibitions worldwide. This is because social and cultural aspects of climate change became more noticeable.
The term ""environmental art"" is often associated with ecological concerns, but it is not limited to them. It primarily celebrates the artist's relationship with nature and often use natural materials. It is closely related to historical earth and land art, as well as ecological art. Environmental artists draw inspiration from science and philosophy.


== History ==

Environmental art has roots in the Paleolithic cave paintings of early humans, although landscapes have not been found in these artworks. Artists throughout history have been drawn to nature as a subject for their creative expressions. Landscape painting allowed artists to observe and connect with the environment. John Constable and Monet are artists who closely observed and represented the natural world in their works. In contemporary times, artists like Diane Burko and Alexis Rockman use art to highlight ecological issues such as climate change and human impact on other species. They bring attention to these topics through their depictions of nature and societal interventions.

Patina,"A patina is a coating of various chemical compounds such as oxides or carbonates formed on the surface of metal or other material. Often this is due to exposure to weather. The word ""patina"" comes from the Latin word meaning ""shallow dish"". For many works of art the patina adds to its value. In many cases, the artist wanted the work to acquire a patina over time.


== Natural patina ==
A patina layer takes many years to develop under natural weathering. Buildings in damp climates will develop patina layers faster than ones in dry areas. The facades of many buildings are made of copper, brass or bronze, for example. These will produce different colors after natural weathering.
Copper takes on a natural green or blue-green patina. Bronze takes on a brown color. Early civilizations used bronze extensively. The Bronze Age is named for it. In the United States, bronze was rarely used in buildings before the American Civil War. Marble, especially white marble, was used in classical Greek and Roman statues. It takes on a light golden patina over time. 
Often, antique and well-used firearms will develop a patina on the steel after the bluing, parkerizing, or other finish has worn off. Firearms in this condition are generally considered more valuable than ones that have been re-blued or parkerized. The patina protects the firearm from the more damaging rust that would occur if the patina were polished off. Rust is sometimes valued as a patina. Examples are rat rods, custom cars and meant to look like early 1940s hot rods. They glorify rusted hot rods that have an almost cartoonish appearance. Some are actually rusted metal while others have a faux (false) finish intended to look like rust.


== Faux patinas ==
Copper items, lamps, fixtures and outdoor projects can be made to look weathered by use of paints or chemicals. For example, a 50/50 mix of ammonia and white vinegar will give copper an aged patina. Architects and craftspeople use copper sulfate on copper items to make them look old. Patina Green is another product used to give copper an instant aged look. Woodworkers and wood finishers mix their own wood stains. This is to match finishes on wood furniture to the same color, tone and patina of the original finish.

Fundamentalism,"Fundamentalism was used at first to describe some people in the Protestant community in the United States in the early 20th century. These people had a set of well-defined (""fundamental"") values. These values were in opposition to more modern ideas. The group also said it was important to stick to what faith (and a more literal translation of the Bible) told them. When people look at religion this way they see the ideas in the religion as absolute. This means that it is not possible for them to change. When religion is seen as absolute it becomes fundamentalism.
Today, the term is used more generally. It is now often used to describe groups of people who are committed to behave or act according to their (mostly moral, and religious) values and beliefs even though these values may be criticised by many people or unpopular. Modern-day fundamentalists want to go back to the roots of certain ideological or religious positions.
Religious fundamentalism has been prevalent in society since its beginnings in the late 19th- and early 20th-century. People today who study fundamentalism see it as a response to modern society. Today society is not as simple as it was: many people live in societies that can be difficult to understand. Changes in familiar things can make people feel unsafe. So some people look in their religion to see something that does not change. They also want rules about how to act that do not change. So they see their religion as this thing that does not change.
See Reformation for an older historical precedent.
Fundamentalism is also a trademarked brand of belts ""to Beat Children."" Fundamentalism Leather Belts have been in countless art exhibits to satirize Fundamentalist Christians who think their God wants them to hit children. The artist and the only publicly recognized owner of Fundamentalism, Daniel Vander Ley, is a child-rights advocate who uses his brand ""Fundamentalism America's Premier Child Abuse Brand"" as a way to confront governments around the world about corporal punishment practices in schools and homes. Corporal Punishment still occurs in public schools in 19 American states.

Some people who are called religious fundamentalists do not like that name, as the term has other meanings. They do not like it because 'religious fundamentalist' has some negative ideas about it. Many people who are politically progressive or liberal sometimes do not like religious fundamentalists. They believe bad things about them like that they are not clever, they are not educated, or that they do not respect people's human rights.
Some people who are Christian fundamentalists do like that term and use it to name themselves. But they do not like being called religious fundamentalists because Islamic fundamentalists are in this same group.


== History ==
Fundamentalism began as a movement in the U.S., starting among conservative Presbyterian academics and theologians at Princeton Theological Seminary in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. It soon spread to conservatives among the Baptists and other denominations during and immediately following the First World War. The movement's purpose was to reaffirm orthodox Protestant Christianity and zealously defend it against the challenges of liberal theology, German higher criticism, Darwinism, and other movements which it regarded as harmful to Christianity.
The term ""fundamentalism"" has its roots in the Niagara Bible Conference (1878–1897) which defined those things that were fundamental to Christian belief. The term was also used to describe ""The Fundamentals"", a collection of twelve books on five subjects published in 1910 and funded by Milton and Lyman Stewart


== Issues of fundamentalism ==
Not all religious fundamentalists believe the same things. But there are many issues that they have strong beliefs about. Some of these issues are similar even in different religions. Some of these issues are:

Abortion
Homosexuality
Feminism (or women's rights)
Sex before marriage
Contraception
Religion as the basis for laws
Teaching religion in schools
Science


== Criticism ==
Many criticisms of fundamentalist positions have been offered. One of the most common is that some claims made by a fundamentalist group cannot be proven, and are irrational, demonstrably false, or contrary to scientific evidence. . For example, some of these criticisms were famously asserted by Clarence Darrow in the Scopes Monkey Trial.
Another is that religious beliefs do not translate well into laws or social policy in diverse tolerant societies. This criticism favors secularism as a better foundation for social harmony and stability.
One of the critics, Elliot N. Dorff wrote:

In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be (found...) among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word (requires) human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.

Ebony (tree),"Ebony is a dense darker than brown hardwood, coming from some species in the genus Diospyros, which has persimmons as well. Not like most trees, ebony is dense enough to slowly fall in water. It is softly textured and has a mirror finish when polished, making it great as an ornamental wood. The word ebony comes from the Ancient Egyptian hbny, through the Ancient Greek ἔβενος (ébenos), as well as Latin and Middle English.


== Species ==
The ebony tree has many species (types), having  Diospyros ebenum (Ceylon ebony), that lives in southern India and Sri Lanka; D. crassiflora (Gabon ebony), usually in western Africa; D. humilis (Queensland ebony), native to Queensland, the Northern Territory, New Guinea and Timor; and D. celebica (Sulawesi ebony), native to Indonesia and prized for its nice, multi-colored wood grain. Mauritius ebony, D. tessellaria, was largely overused by the Dutch in the 17th century. Some species in the genus have an ebony with similar looks, but striped rather than the even black of D. ebenum.


== Uses ==

Ebony has been used for a very long time, and carved pieces have been found in Ancient Egyptian tombs.
By the end of the 16th century, fine cabinets for the luxury trade were made of ebony in Antwerp. The wood's dense hardness helped people create refined moldings framing finely detailed pictorial panels with carving in very low relief (bas-relief), usually of allegorical subjects, or with scenes taken from classical or Christian history. Within a short time, such cabinets were also being made in Paris, where their makers became known as ébénistes, which remains the French term for a cabinetmaker.

Modern uses are largely restricted to small items, such as crucifixes, the main body of some musical instruments such as the clarinet, oboe, or piccolo and musical instrument parts, including black piano, organ, and harpsichord keys; violin, viola, mandolin, guitar, double bass, and cello fingerboards; tailpieces; tuning pegs; chinrests; and bow frogs. Many plectrums, or guitar picks, are made from ebony.
Traditionally, black chess pieces were made from ebony, with boxwood or ivory being used for the white pieces. Modern East Midlands-style lace-making bobbins, also being small, are often made of ebony and look particularly decorative when bound with brass or silver wire. Some expensive handgun grips and rifle fore-end tips are still made of ebony, as are the butts of pool cues.
As a result of unsustainable harvesting, many species yielding ebony are now considered threatened. Most indigenous ebony in Africa in particular has been cut down illegally.


== Protection ==
In Sri Lanka, ebony is a protected species and harvesting and sale of ebony is illegal and punishable by imprisonment.
In 2011, the Gibson Guitar company was raided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for violations of the Lacey Act of 1900, which prohibits the illegal importation of threatened woods and other materials.
An ebony and rosewood expert at the Missouri Botanical Garden calls the Madagascar wood trade the ""equivalent of Africa's blood diamonds"".

The software blocks websites by the content on the website rather than by their URL. This prevents children from accessing inappropriate content using a web proxy.


== History ==
Net Nanny was created and started by Gordon Ross in 1994 in Vancouver and moved to Bellevue, Washington in 2000. He became inspired to create a parental control service after viewing a sting operation on a pedophile soliciting a child online. In 1998, the company launched BioPassword, a bio metric security access system based on technology it acquired from Stanford University. On November 14, 2002, Net Nanny filed for bankruptcy and was sold to BioNet Systems, LLC, a maker of bio metric security software in Issaquah, Washington. LookSmart Ltd, a commercial web search company based in San Francisco acquired Net Nanny for $5.3 million in stock and cash in April 2004.
In January of 2007, Net Nanny was bought by ContentWatch, Inc and was moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. In June 2012, Net Nanny was made available to iOS and Android users. These mobile apps allowed parents to view and manage the applications on the device. In 2013, Net Nanny Social was launched to allow parents to monitor their children's social media activity and to protect against cyber bullying, cyber stalking, grooming by sexual predators, and the spread of sensitive images and videos.
In 2016, Zift Software, LLC, acquired Net Nanny from ContentWatch and moved to Philadelphia. On May 28, 2019, Zift's applications were rebranded as the Net Nanny 10 that is currently in use today.

Engineering,"Engineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process to solve technical problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems. Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy systems.
The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. See glossary of engineering.
The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning ""cleverness"".


== Definition ==
The American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD, the predecessor of ABET) has defined ""engineering"" as:

The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.


== History ==

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.
The term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engine'er (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to ""a constructor of military engines"". In this context, now obsolete, an ""engine"" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The word ""engine"" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning ""innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.""
Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering.


=== Ancient era ===

The pyramids in ancient Egypt, ziggurats of Mesopotamia, the Acropolis and Parthenon in Greece, the Roman aqueducts, Via Appia and Colosseum, Teotihuacán, and the Brihadeeswarar Temple of Thanjavur, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Pharos of Alexandria, were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3000 BC, and then in ancient Egyptian technology c. 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911–609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep. As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC. The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.
Kush developed the Sakia during the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy. Hafirs were developed as a type of reservoir in Kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation. Sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns. Kushite ancestors built speos during the Bronze Age between 3700 and 3250 BC. Bloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the 7th centuries BC in Kush.
Ancient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, an early known mechanical analog computer, and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes, are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are widely used in fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.
Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hunnic armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC, the trireme, the ballista and the catapult. In the Middle Ages, the trebuchet was developed.


=== Middle Ages ===
The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD. The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.
The cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD, and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century, both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century.
The earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century. In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.

Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as millwrights, clockmakers, instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.: 32 
A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise De re metallica (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry. De re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.


=== Modern era ===

The science of classical mechanics, sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering. With the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering.
Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.
John Smeaton was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the ""father"" of civil engineering. He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges, canals, harbors, and lighthouses. He was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.: 127    Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.: 69  Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the Newcomen steam engine. Smeaton designed the third Eddystone Lighthouse (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of 'hydraulic lime' (a form of mortar which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern cement, because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain ""hydraulicity"" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of Portland cement.
Applied science led to the development of the steam engine. The sequence of events began with the invention of the barometer and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by Otto von Guericke using the Magdeburg hemispheres in 1656, laboratory experiments by Denis Papin, who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707. Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a coffee percolator. Samuel Morland, a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that Thomas Savery read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called ""The Miner's Friend"". It employed both vacuum and pressure. Iron merchant Thomas Newcomen, who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.: 32 

The application of steam-powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for blast furnaces lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century. The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam-powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in blast furnaces, which enabled the transition from charcoal to coke. These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making horse railways and iron bridges practical. The puddling process, patented by Henry Cort in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron. Hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron. With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible. New steel making processes, such as the Bessemer process and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.
One of the most famous engineers of the mid-19th century was Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The Industrial Revolution created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several machine tools. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until John Wilkinson invented his boring machine, which is considered the first machine tool. Other machine tools included the screw cutting lathe, milling machine, turret lathe and the metal planer. Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century. These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position. Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing interchangeable parts lead to large scale factory production by the late 19th century.
The United States Census of 1850 listed the occupation of ""engineer"" for the first time with a count of 2,000. There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875. In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, mining, mechanical and electrical.
There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907. Germany established technical universities earlier.
The foundations of electrical engineering in the 1800s included the experiments of Alessandro Volta, Michael Faraday, Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric telegraph in 1816 and the electric motor in 1872. The theoretical work of James Maxwell (see: Maxwell's equations) and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of electronics. The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.
Chemical engineering developed in the late nineteenth century. Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants. The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.

Aeronautical engineering deals with aircraft design process design while aerospace engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including spacecraft design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.
The first PhD in engineering (technically, applied science and engineering) awarded in the United States went to Josiah Willard Gibbs at Yale University in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.
Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers, there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in World War I. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments.


== Main branches of engineering ==

Engineering is a broad discipline that is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches: chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.


=== Chemical engineering ===

Chemical engineering is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of commodity chemicals, specialty chemicals, petroleum refining, microfabrication, fermentation, and biomolecule production.


=== Civil engineering ===

Civil engineering is the design and construction of public and private works, such as infrastructure (airports, roads, railways, water supply, and treatment etc.), bridges, tunnels, dams, and buildings. Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including structural engineering, environmental engineering, and surveying. It is traditionally considered to be separate from military engineering.


=== Electrical engineering ===

Electrical engineering is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as broadcast engineering, electrical circuits, generators, motors, electromagnetic/electromechanical devices, electronic devices, electronic circuits, optical fibers, optoelectronic devices, computer systems, telecommunications, instrumentation, control systems, and electronics.


=== Mechanical engineering ===

Mechanical engineering is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and energy systems, aerospace/aircraft products, weapon systems, transportation products, engines, compressors, powertrains, kinematic chains, vacuum technology, vibration isolation equipment, manufacturing, robotics, turbines, audio equipments, and mechatronics.


=== Bioengineering ===

Bioengineering is the engineering of biological systems for a useful purpose. Examples of bioengineering research include bacteria engineered to produce chemicals, new medical imaging technology, portable and rapid disease diagnostic devices, prosthetics, biopharmaceuticals, and tissue-engineered organs.


== Interdisciplinary engineering ==

Interdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of the practice. Historically, naval engineering and mining engineering were major branches. Other engineering fields are manufacturing engineering, acoustical engineering, corrosion engineering, instrumentation and control, aerospace, automotive, computer, electronic, information engineering, petroleum, environmental, systems, audio, software, architectural, agricultural, biosystems, biomedical, geological, textile, industrial, materials, and nuclear engineering. These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council.
New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, Earth systems engineering and management involves a wide range of subject areas including engineering studies, environmental science, engineering ethics and philosophy of engineering.


== Other branches of engineering ==


=== Aerospace engineering ===

Aerospace engineering covers the design, development, manufacture and operational behaviour of aircraft, satellites and rockets.


=== Marine engineering ===

Marine engineering covers the design, development, manufacture and operational behaviour of watercraft and stationary structures like oil platforms and ports.


=== Computer engineering ===

Computer engineering (CE) is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering.


=== Geological engineering ===

Geological engineering is associated with anything constructed on or within the Earth. This discipline applies geological sciences and engineering principles to direct or support the work of other disciplines such as civil engineering, environmental engineering, and mining engineering. Geological engineers are involved with impact studies for facilities and operations that affect surface and subsurface environments, such as rock excavations (e.g. tunnels), building foundation consolidation, slope and fill stabilization, landslide risk assessment, groundwater monitoring, groundwater remediation, mining excavations, and natural resource exploration.


== Practice ==

One who practices engineering is called an engineer, and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Ingenieur, European Engineer, or Designated Engineering Representative.


== Methodology ==

In the engineering design process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their careers.
If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.
Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, safety, marketability, productivity, and serviceability. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.


=== Problem solving ===

Engineers use their knowledge of science, mathematics, logic, economics, and appropriate experience or tacit knowledge to find suitable solutions to a particular problem. Creating an appropriate mathematical model of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.
More than one solution to a design problem usually exists so the different design choices have to be evaluated on their merits before the one judged most suitable is chosen. Genrich Altshuller, after gathering statistics on a large number of patents, suggested that compromises are at the heart of ""low-level"" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.
Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: prototypes, scale models, simulations, destructive tests, nondestructive tests, and stress tests. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected but only in so far as the testing has been representative of use in service. For products, such as aircraft, that are used differently by different users failures and unexpected shortcomings (and necessary design changes) can be expected throughout the operational life of the product.
Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and, except those employed in specific areas of the arms industry, will not harm people. Engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.
The study of failed products is known as forensic engineering. It attempts to identify the cause of failure to allow a redesign of the product and so prevent a re-occurrence. Careful analysis is needed to establish the cause of failure of a product. The consequences of a failure may vary in severity from the minor cost of a machine breakdown to large loss of life in the case of accidents involving aircraft and large stationary structures like buildings and dams.


=== Computer use ===

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business application software there are a number of computer aided applications (computer-aided technologies) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using numerical methods.

One of the most widely used design tools in the profession is computer-aided design (CAD) software. It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with digital mockup (DMU) and CAE software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.
These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of product data management software.
There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software to generate CNC machining instructions; manufacturing process management software for production engineering; EDA for printed circuit board (PCB) and circuit schematics for electronic engineers; MRO applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.
In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as product lifecycle management (PLM).


== Social context ==

The engineering profession engages in a range of activities, from collaboration at the societal level, and smaller individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are obligated to a funding source: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The types of engineering that are less constrained by such a funding source, are pro bono, and open-design engineering.
Engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior. Most products and constructions used by modern society, are influenced by engineering. Engineering activities have an impact on the environment, society, economies, and public safety.
Engineering projects can be controversial. Examples from different engineering disciplines include: the development of nuclear weapons, the Three Gorges Dam, the design and use of sport utility vehicles and the extraction of oil. In response, some engineering companies have enacted serious corporate and social responsibility policies.
The attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.

Overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers, to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. Some charitable organizations use engineering directly for development:

Engineers Without Borders
Engineers Against Poverty
Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
Engineers for a Sustainable World
Engineering for Change
Engineering Ministries International
Engineering companies in more developed economies face challenges with regard to the number of engineers being trained, compared with those retiring. This problem is prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status. There are negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues. It is agreed the engineering profession faces an ""image crisis"". The UK holds the most engineering companies compared to other European countries, together with the United States.


=== Code of ethics ===

Many engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. The National Society of Professional Engineers code of ethics states:

 Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.
In Canada, engineers wear the Iron Ring as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.


== Relationships with other disciplines ==


=== Science ===
Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has never been.

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.
Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology, engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely ""engineering scientists"".

In the book What Engineers Know and How They Know It, Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.
There is a ""real and important"" difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology. Physics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles. The former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology. For technology, physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics. Though physics and engineering are interrelated, it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineer's job. A physicist would typically require additional and relevant training. Physicists and engineers engage in different lines of work. But PhD physicists who specialize in sectors of engineering physics and applied physics are titled as Technology officer, R&D Engineers and System Engineers.
An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the Navier–Stokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of the finite element method to calculate the stresses in complex components. Second, engineering research employs many semi-empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.
As stated by Fung et al. in the revision to the classic engineering text Foundations of Solid Mechanics:

Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.
Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.


=== Medicine and biology ===

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. Medicine aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the human body, if necessary, through the use of technology.

Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, brain implants and pacemakers. The fields of bionics and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.
Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and a",1

It is similar to a credit card, but unlike a credit card, it does not borrow money.  Instead, the money comes directly from the user's bank account, and if there is no money it does not work.

Epicurean paradox,"The Epicurean paradox is a logical dilemma about the problem of evil attributed to the Greek philosopher Epicurus, who argued against the existence of a god who is simultaneously omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent.


== The paradox ==
The logic of the paradox proposed by Epicurus takes three possible characteristics of a god (omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence – complete power, knowledge, and benevolence) and pairs the concepts together. It is postulated that in each pair, if the two members are true, the missing member cannot also be true, making the paradox a trilemma. The paradox also theorizes how if it is illogical for one of the characteristics to be true, then it cannot be the case that a god with all three exists. The pairs of the characteristics and their potential contradictions they would create consist of the following:

If a god knows everything and has unlimited power, then it has knowledge of all evil and has the power to put an end to it. But if it does not end it, it is not completely benevolent.
If a god has unlimited power and is completely good, then it has the power to extinguish evil and want to extinguish it. But if it does not do it, its knowledge of evil is limited, so it is not all-knowing.
If a god is all-knowing and totally good, then it knows of all the evil that exists and wants to change it. But if it does not, it must be because it is not capable of changing it, so it is not omnipotent.


== God in Epicureanism ==
Epicurus was not an atheist, although he rejected the idea of a god concerned with human affairs; followers of Epicureanism denied the idea that there was no god. While the conception of a supreme, happy and blessed god was the most popular during his time, Epicurus rejected such a notion, as he considered it too heavy a burden for a god to have to worry about all the problems in the world. For this reason, Epicureanism postulates that gods would not have any special affection for human beings and would not know of their existence, serving only as moral ideals that humanity could try to get closer to. Epicurus came to the conclusion that the gods could not be concerned with the well-being of humanity through observing the problem of evil; that is, the presence of suffering on earth.


== Attribution and variations ==

There is no text by Epicurus that confirms his authorship of the argument. Therefore, although it was popular with the skeptical school of Greek philosophy, it is possible that Epicurus' paradox was wrongly attributed to him by Lactantius who, from his Christian perspective, while attacking the problem proposed by the Greek, would have considered him an atheist. German scholar Reinhold F. Glei believes that the theodicy argument is from a non-Epicurean or anti-Epicurean academic source. The oldest preserved version of this trilemma appears in the writings of the skeptic Sextus Empiricus.
Charles Bray, in his book The Philosophy of Necessity of 1863, quotes Epicurus without mentioning his source as the author of the following excerpt:

Would God be willing to prevent evil but unable? Therefore he is not omnipotent. Would he be capable, but without desire? So he is malevolent. Would he be both capable and willing? So why is there evil?
N. A. Nicholson, in his Philosophical Papers of 1864, attributes ""the famous inquiries"" to Epicurus, using words previously phrased by Hume. Hume's phrase occurs in the tenth book of his acclaimed Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, published posthumously in 1779. The character Philo begins his speech by saying ""Epicurus' ancient questions remain unanswered"". Hume's quote comes from Pierre Bayle's influential Dictionnaire Historique et Critique, which quotes Lactantius attributing the questions to Epicurus. This attribution occurs in chapter 13 of Lactantius's ""De Ira Dei"", which provides no sources.
Hume postulates:

[God's] power is infinite: whatever he desires is executed. But neither man nor any other animal is happy. Therefore he does not want your happiness. His wisdom is infinite: he never errs in choosing the means to any end: but the course of nature tends to be contrary to any human or animal happiness: therefore it is not established for such a purpose. Throughout the entire history of human knowledge, there are no more certain and infallible inferences than these. In what point, therefore, do your benevolence and mercy remind you of the benevolence and mercy of men?

Plumbing,"Plumbing (which comes from the Latin word plumbum, which means lead, as pipes were once made from lead) is the job of working with pipes, tubing and plumbing fixtures for drinking water systems and getting rid of waste. A plumber is someone who fixes or puts in piping systems, plumbing fixtures and equipment such as water heaters. Many plumbers are construction workers. The plumbing industry is an important part of every developed economy because people need clean water and safe ways to move and store waste.
Plumbing also refers to a system of pipes and fixtures put in a building to move water and the get rid of waste that is in water. Plumbing is different from water and sewage systems because plumbing system serves one building, while water and sewage systems serve a group of buildings or a city.


== History ==

Plumbing was very rare until modern cities grew in the 19th century. At about the same time, public health leaders began wanting better systems to get rid of waste. Before this, people got rid of waste by collecting it and dumping it onto the ground or into rivers. However, there were some plumbing pipes in the city settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization by 2700 B.C. Plumbing was also used during the ancient civilizations such as the Greek, Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations as they built public baths and needed drinking water, and somewhere to drain waste. The Romans used pipe inscriptions to stop people from stealing water. 
These systems did not improve much over the years. There were almost no improvements from the time of the Roman aqueducts and sewers until the 19th century. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems got rid of open sewage ditches and cesspools. Most large cities today send solid wastes through pipes to sewage treatment plants. Treatment separates water from waste and makes the water more pure before it goes into streams or other bodies of water. Most places stopped using lead for drinking water after World War II because of the dangers of lead poisoning. At this time, copper piping was started because it was safer than using lead pipes.


== Materials ==
Water systems in ancient times used gravity to move water. They used pipes or channels usually made of clay, lead, bamboo or stone. Today, water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes are now made of copper, brass, plastic, or other nontoxic material. Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast-iron, and lead. Lead is not used in pipes today because it can be poisonous.

The 'straight' sections of plumbing systems are of pipe or tube.  A pipe is usually made by casting or welding, where a tube is made through extrusion.  Pipe usually has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, where tubes have thinner walls, and needs special joining techniques such as 'brazing', 'compression fitting', 'crimping', or for plastics, 'solvent welding'.
As well as the straight pipe or tubing, many fittings are required in plumbing systems, such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions.
Plumbing fixtures are designed for the people who use the water.  Some examples of fixtures include water closets (also known as toilets), urinals, bidets, showers, bathtubs, utility and kitchen sinks, drinking fountains, ice makers, humidifiers, air washers, fountains, and eye wash stations.


== Regulation ==
Much of the plumbing work in places where many people live is done under government rules. Putting in plumbing and fixing plumbing generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the people who live or work in the buildings.

Coin of account,"A coin of account is a unit of money that does not exist as an actual coin (that is, a metal disk) but is used in figuring prices or other amounts of money.


== Examples ==


=== Mill ===
The mill (or sometimes, mil) is a coin of account in the United States.  It is equal to one-tenth of a penny, and so to one-thousandth of a dollar (= $0.001), whence the name, which means ""thousandth."" There was never such a coin minted by the U.S. Federal government, though some states minted these coins well into the mid-1900s. Coins of account are used in accounting and for figuring taxes, usually either property taxes or sales taxes.


=== Guinea ===
From 1816 to the 1980s the British Guinea was no longer used a coin but prices for luxury items and professional services were often quoted in guineas, on the understanding that a guinea was equal to 21 shillings.

Lion Tombstones,"Lion Tombstones (Persian: شیر سنگی šir-e sangi; Bakhtiari: بردشیر bardšir, meaning “stone lion”), are a type of tombstone formed in the shape of a lion. They are primarily found on the graves of Lor, Bakhtiari and Qašqāʾi nomads in the southwestern region of Iran. There were some stone lions in Ardal, Absardeh village, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari in Iran. It is a historical place  and these lions were located in a domestic cemetery. Age of these stones dates back to 500 years ago.


== The lion in Bakhtiari beliefs ==
The lion (shir) is often presented in Bakhtiari oral and folklore legends as a real and wild animal. The Iranian lion (Panthera Leo Persica) was the size of the Iranian panther. This breed of lion is extinct. However, this lion lived in the regions such as the Arzhan Plain (دشت ارژن) (located about 60 kilometers to the west of Shiraz), in the mountain of Zagros and in the region of Khuzestan.


== Characteristics ==
In fact, the lion stones are statues that were made by stonemasons and placed at the graves of people from the Bakhtiari tribe in the past.  The great difference in the number of these stone lions in various cemeteries could be an indication of the wealth of the individuals whose graves they mark and the sanctity of a particular burial ground.


== Today's Effects ==
Today Stone lions have an important and enduring significance. In the absence of a written history, they are one way in which the Baḵtiāris are able to celebrate their past. Songs and traditions, such as traditional lamentations (gāgeriva).

Spectrograph,"A spectrograph  is an instrument that breaks up a wave into a frequency spectrum. These could be sound, light or radio waves. For example the frequency spectrum of light is the brightness (intensity) and the amount of each colour. There are several kinds of machines called spectrographs, used to look at different waves. The term was first used in 1884.
A spectrograph is closely related to a polychromator.


== Spectrographs and astronomy ==
In astronomy, the first spectrographs used photographic paper as the detector. The star spectral classification and discovery of the main sequence, Hubble's law and the Hubble sequence were all made using photographic paper. The plant pigment phytochrome was discovered using a spectrograph that used living plants as the detector. New spectrographs use electronic detectors, such as CCDs which can be used for both visible and UV light. The type of detector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded.


== Echelle spectrograph ==
An echelle spectrograph is a special machine which is able to break up light waves, with a high resolution and little interference. It does this by using very narrow slits which breaks light into beams, and then breaking up those beams again.

Kattappana,"Kattappana ([kaʈ:ap:ɐna]) is a municipality in the Idukki district of Kerala, India. It is located 21 km (13.0 mi) southeast of the district headquarters in Painavu and about 140 km (87.0 mi) north of the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram. Kattappana is the second-largest municipality in the district by population, and serves as a major hub for commercial and economic activity for the surrounding region.
Kattappana was formed primarily by settlers from Pala, Changanassery, Kanjirapally, Thodupuzha and Kothamangalam in the 1950s, and was given the status of gram panchayat in 1962. The town later attained the Municipality status in 2015.


== History ==


=== Historical Development ===

Equilibrium moisture content,"The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of a hygroscopic material surrounded at least partially by air is the moisture content at which the material is neither gaining nor losing moisture. The value of the EMC depends on the material and the relative humidity and temperature of the air with which it is in contact. The speed with which it is approached depends on the properties of the material, the surface-area-to-volume ratio of its shape, and the speed with which humidity is carried away or towards the material (e.g. diffusion in stagnant air or convection in moving air).

== Equilibrium moisture content of grains ==
The moisture content of grains is an essential property in food storage. The moisture content that is safe for long-term storage is 12% for corn, sorghum, rice and wheat and 11% for soybean
At a constant relative humidity of air, the EMC will drop by about 0.5% for every increase of 10 °C air temperature.
The following table shows the equilibriums for a number of grains (data from ). These values are only approximations since the exact values depend on the specific variety of a grain.


== Equilibrium moisture content of wood ==
The moisture content of wood below the fiber saturation point is a function of both relative humidity and temperature of surrounding air. The moisture content (M) of wood is defined as:

 is the oven-dry mass of wood (i.e. no moisture). If the wood is placed in an environment at a particular temperature and relative humidity, its moisture content will generally begin to change in time, until it is finally in equilibrium with its surroundings, and the moisture content no longer changes in time. This moisture content is the EMC of the wood for that temperature and relative humidity.
The Hailwood-Horrobin equation for two hydrates is often used to approximate the relationship between EMC, temperature (T), and relative humidity (h):

== Equilibrium moisture content of sands, soils and building materials ==
Materials such as stones, sand and ceramics are considered 'dry' and have much lower equilibrium moisture content than organic material like wood and leather.  typically a fraction of a percent by weight when in equilibrium of air of Relative humidity 10% to 90%. This affects the rate that buildings need to dry out after construction, typical cements starting with 40-60% water content. 
This is also important for construction materials such as render reinforced with organic materials, as modest changes in content of different types of straw and wood shavings  have a significant influence on the overall moisture content

Bhutanese animation,"Bhutanese animation is animation from Bhutan. It is mostly used to make people aware of relevant social issues, economical issues and political issues or to promote Bhutanese culture. Bhutanese animators and clients believe using animation for public awareness is more effective than brochures and pamphlets. For example, Ap Naka was made to tell people about earthquakes.
The Bhutanese animation industry is quite new. Pema Tshering D made the first Bhutanese 3D-animated film, which came out in 2001. His first animation was of a beetle dancing, and his first public awareness animation is Oye Penjor, which is about AIDS. It took about three months to make, was the first Bhutanese 3D animation, and was made with Druk Vision Studio, which he owns. In 2005, KLK anImagine and Druk Vision Studio, which are major animation studios in Bhutan, were started. KLK anImagine is owned by Kinga Sithup. The first Bhutanese 2D animation is an awareness campaign about rubella that was made by KLK anImagine. It is common for Bhutanese animators to split 10 frames into 25 frames or to animate in 24 frames per second. By 2008, Druk Vision Studio had made about 7 animated films, and KLK anImagine had made about 20 animated films.
The first Bhutanese full-length 3D-animated film is Ap Bokto, which first came out in September 2014. Ap Bokto was made by Athang Animation Studio, which was started in 2010.

Microeconomics,"Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms. Microeconomics focuses on the study of individual markets, sectors, or industries as opposed to the economy as a whole, which is studied in macroeconomics.
One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results.
While microeconomics focuses on firms and individuals, macroeconomics focuses on the total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth, inflation, and unemployment—and with national policies relating to these issues. Microeconomics also deals with the effects of economic policies (such as changing taxation levels) on microeconomic behavior and thus on the aforementioned aspects of the economy. Particularly in the wake of the Lucas critique, much of modern macroeconomic theories has been built upon microfoundations—i.e., based upon basic assumptions about micro-level behavior.


== Assumptions and definitions ==
Microeconomic study historically has been performed according to general equilibrium theory, developed by Léon Walras in Elements of Pure Economics (1874) and partial equilibrium theory, introduced by Alfred Marshall in Principles of Economics (1890).
Microeconomic theory typically begins with the study of a single rational and utility maximizing individual. To economists, rationality means an individual possesses stable preferences that are both complete and transitive. 
The technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function. Although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption, it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable.
Microeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set. It is at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non-satiated. Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is no 100% guarantee but there would be a rational rise 
in individual utility. With the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem (UMP) is developed.
The utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory. The utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences.  The utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain what or how individuals make choices but why individuals make choices as well.
The utility maximization problem is a constrained optimization problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. Economists use the extreme value theorem to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. That is, since the budget constraint is both bounded and closed, a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a Walrasian demand function or correspondence. 
The utility maximization problem has so far been developed by taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as primitive. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by taking consumer choice as primitive. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as revealed preference theory.

The theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive. This implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services. In many real-life transactions, the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices. Quite often, a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand-supply equation of a good model. However, the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions.
Mainstream economics does not assume a priori that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization. In fact, much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss. A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good. In such cases, economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste, either directly by government control, indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare, or by creating ""missing markets"" to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed.
This is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory. ""Optimal welfare"" usually takes on a Paretian norm, which is a mathematical application of the Kaldor–Hicks method. This can diverge from the Utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people. Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics) is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory.
The demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process, with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set.


=== Allocation of scarce resources ===
Individuals and firms need to allocate limited resources to ensure all agents in the economy are well off. Firms decide which goods and services to produce considering low costs involving labor, materials and capital as well as potential profit margins. Consumers choose the good and services they want that will maximize their happiness taking into account their limited wealth.
The government can make these allocation decisions or they can be independently made by the consumers and firms. For example, in the former Soviet Union, the government played a part in informing car manufacturers which cars to produce and which consumers will gain access to a car.


== History ==

Economists commonly consider themselves microeconomists or macroeconomists. The difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics likely was introduced in 1933 by the Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch, the co-recipient of the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969. However, Frisch did not actually use the word ""microeconomics"", instead drawing distinctions between ""micro-dynamic"" and ""macro-dynamic"" analysis in a way similar to how the words ""microeconomics"" and ""macroeconomics"" are used today. The first known use of the term ""microeconomics"" in a published article was from Pieter de Wolff in 1941, who broadened the term ""micro-dynamics"" into ""microeconomics"".

=== Consumer demand theory ===

Consumer demand theory relates preferences for the consumption of both goods and services to the consumption expenditures; ultimately, this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to consumer demand curves. The link between personal preferences, consumption and the demand curve is one of the most closely studied relations in economics. It is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints.


=== Production theory ===

Production theory is the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs. Production uses resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use, gift-giving in a gift economy, or exchange in a market economy. This can include manufacturing, storing, shipping, and packaging. Some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption. They see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production.


=== Cost-of-production theory of value ===

The cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production (including labor, capital, or land) and taxation. Technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital (e.g. an industrial plant) or circulating capital (e.g. intermediate goods).
In the mathematical model for the cost of production, the short-run total cost is equal to fixed cost plus total variable cost. The fixed cost refers to the cost that is incurred regardless of how much the firm produces. The variable cost is a function of the quantity of an object being produced. The cost function can be used to characterize production through the duality theory in economics, developed mainly by Ronald Shephard (1953, 1970) and other scholars (Sickles & Zelenyuk, 2019, ch. 2).


=== Fixed and variable costs ===
Fixed cost (FC) – This cost does not change with output. It includes business expenses such as rent, salaries and utility bills.
Variable cost (VC) – This cost changes as output changes. This includes raw materials, delivery costs and production supplies.
Over a short time period (few months), most costs are fixed costs as the firm will have to pay for salaries, contracted shipment and materials used to produce various goods. Over a longer time period (2-3 years), costs can become variable. Firms can decide to reduce output, purchase fewer materials and even sell some machinery. Over 10 years, most costs become variable as workers can be laid off or new machinery can be bought to replace the old machinery 
Sunk Costs – This is a fixed cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. An example of this can be in R&D development like in the pharmaceutical industry. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to achieve new drug breakthroughs but this is challenging as its increasingly harder to find new breakthroughs and meet tighter regulation standards. Thus many projects are written off leading to losses of millions of dollars 


=== Opportunity cost ===

Opportunity cost is closely related to the idea of time constraints. One can do only one thing at a time, which means that, inevitably, one is always giving up other things. The opportunity cost of any activity is the value of the next-best alternative thing one may have done instead. Opportunity cost depends only on the value of the next-best alternative. It does not matter whether one has five alternatives or 5,000.
Opportunity costs can tell when not to do something as well as when to do something. For example, one may like waffles, but like chocolate even more. If someone offers only waffles, one would take it. But if offered waffles or chocolate, one would take the chocolate. The opportunity cost of eating waffles is sacrificing the chance to eat chocolate. Because the cost of not eating the chocolate is higher than the benefits of eating the waffles, it makes no sense to choose waffles. Of course, if one chooses chocolate, they are still faced with the opportunity cost of giving up having waffles. But one is willing to do that because the waffle's opportunity cost is lower than the benefits of the chocolate. Opportunity costs are unavoidable constraints on behavior because one has to decide what's best and give up the next-best alternative.


=== Price theory ===
Microeconomics is also known as price theory to highlight the significance of prices in relation to buyer and sellers as these agents determine prices due to their individual actions. Price theory is a field of economics that uses the supply and demand framework to explain and predict human behavior. It is associated with the Chicago School of Economics. Price theory studies competitive equilibrium in markets to yield testable hypotheses that can be rejected.
Price theory is not the same as microeconomics. Strategic behavior, such as the interactions among sellers in a market where they are few, is a significant part of microeconomics but is not emphasized in price theory. Price theorists focus on competition believing it to be a reasonable description of most markets that leaves room to study additional aspects of tastes and technology. As a result, price theory tends to use less game theory than microeconomics does.
Price theory focuses on how agents respond to prices, but its framework can be applied to a wide variety of socioeconomic issues that might not seem to involve prices at first glance. Price theorists have influenced several other fields including developing public choice theory and law and economics. Price theory has been applied to issues previously thought of as outside the purview of economics such as criminal justice, marriage, and addiction.


== Microeconomic models ==


=== Supply and demand ===

Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market. It concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium.

Prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.
For a given market of a commodity, demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is ""constrained utility maximization"" (with income and wealth as the constraints on demand). Here, utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.
The law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.
Supply is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be profit maximizers, meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.
That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The ""Law of Supply"" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors of inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.
Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.
For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility, to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit. The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.
On the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) variable in the short run, which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively fixed, such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the long run, all inputs may be adjusted by management. These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.
Marginalist theory, such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to income and wealth constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares marginal revenue (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the marginal cost of a good, with marginal profit the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change ""at the margin"": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing.
Other applications of demand and supply include the distribution of income among the factors of production, including labor and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive labor market for example the quantity of labor employed and the price of labor (the wage rate) depends on the demand for labor (from employers for production) and supply of labor (from potential workers). Labor economics examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labor income, labor mobility, and (un)employment, productivity through human capital, and related public-policy issues.
Demand-and-supply analysis is used to explain the behavior of perfectly competitive markets, but as a standard of comparison it can be extended to any type of market. It can also be generalized to explain variables across the economy, for example, total output (estimated as real GDP) and the general price level, as studied in macroeconomics. Tracing the qualitative and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand, whether in the short or long run, is a standard exercise in applied economics. Economic theory may also specify conditions such that supply and demand through the market is an efficient mechanism for allocating resources.


== Market structure ==

Market structure refers to features of a market, including the number of firms in the market, the distribution of market shares between them, product uniformity across firms, how easy it is for firms to enter and exit the market, and forms of competition in the market. A market structure can have several types of interacting market systems. 
Different forms of markets are a feature of capitalism and market socialism, with advocates of state socialism often criticizing markets and aiming to substitute or replace markets with varying degrees of government-directed economic planning. 
Competition acts as a regulatory mechanism for market systems, with government providing regulations where the market cannot be expected to regulate itself. Regulations help to mitigate negative externalities of goods and services when the private equilibrium of the market does not match the social equilibrium. One example of this is with regards to building codes, which if absent in a purely competition regulated market system, might result in several horrific injuries or deaths to be required before companies would begin improving structural safety, as consumers may at first not be as concerned or aware of safety issues to begin putting pressure on companies to provide them, and companies would be motivated not to provide proper safety features due to how it would cut into their profits.
The concept of ""market type"" is different from the concept of ""market structure"". Nevertheless, there are a variety of types of markets.
The different market structures produce cost curves based on the type of structure present. The different curves are developed based on the costs of production, specifically the graph contains marginal cost, average total cost, average variable cost, average fixed cost, and marginal revenue, which is sometimes equal to the demand, average revenue, and price in a price-taking firm.


=== Perfect competition ===

Perfect competition is a situation in which numerous small firms producing identical products compete against each other in a given industry. Perfect competition leads to firms producing the socially optimal output level at the minimum possible cost per unit. Firms in perfect competition are ""price takers"" (they do not have enough market power to profitably increase the price of their goods or services). A good example would be that of digital marketplaces, such as eBay, on which many different sellers sell similar products to many different buyers. Consumers in a perfect competitive market have perfect knowledge about the products that are being sold in this market.


=== Imperfect competition ===

Imperfect competition is a type of market structure showing some but not all features of competitive markets. In perfect competition, market power is not achievable due to a high level of producers causing high levels of competition. Therefore, prices are brought down to a marginal cost level. In a monopoly, market power is achieved by one firm leading to prices being higher than the marginal cost level.  
Between these two types of markets are firms that are neither perfectly competitive or monopolistic. Firms such as Pepsi and Coke and Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft dominate the cola and video game industry respectively. These firms are in imperfect competition 


=== Monopolistic competition ===

Monopolistic competition is a situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete. Production costs are above what may be achieved by perfectly competitive firms, but society benefits from the product differentiation. Examples of industries with market structures similar to monopolistic competition include restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and service industries in large cities.


=== Monopoly ===

A monopoly is a market structure in which a market or industry is dominated by a single supplier of a particular good or service. Because monopolies have no competition, they tend to sell goods and services at a higher price and produce below the socially optimal output level. However, not all monopolies are a bad thing, especially in industries where multiple firms would result in more costs than benefits (i.e. natural monopolies).

Natural monopoly: A monopoly in an industry where one producer can produce output at a lower cost than many small producers.


=== Oligopoly ===

An oligopoly is a market structure in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of firms (oligopolists). Oligopolies can create the incentive for firms to engage in collusion and form cartels that reduce competition leading to higher prices for consumers and less overall market output. Alternatively, oligopolies can be fiercely competitive and engage in flamboyant advertising campaigns.

Duopoly: A special case of an oligopoly, with only two firms. Game theory can elucidate behavior in duopolies and oligopolies.


=== Monopsony ===

A monopsony is a market where there is only one buyer and many sellers.


=== Bilateral monopoly ===

A bilateral monopoly is a market consisting of both a monopoly (a single seller) and a monopsony (a single buyer).


=== Oligopsony ===

An oligopsony is a market where there are a few buyers and many sellers.


== Game theory ==

Game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. The term ""game"" here implies the study of any strategic interaction between people. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers & acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design, and voting systems, and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.


== Information economics ==

Information economics is a branch of microeconomic theory that studies how information and information systems affect an economy and economic decisions. Information has special characteristics. It is easy to create but hard to trust. It is easy to spread but hard to control. It influences many decisions. These special characteristics (as compared with other types of goods) complicate many standard economic theories. The economics of information has recently become of great interest to many - possibly due to the rise of information-based companies inside the technology industry. From a game theory approach, the usual constraints that agents have complete information can be loosened to further examine the consequences of having incomplete information. This gives rise to many results which are applicable to real life situations. For example, if one does loosen this assumption, then it is possible to scrutinize the actions of agents in situations of uncertainty. It is also possible to more fully understand the impacts – both positive and negative – of agents seeking out or acquiring information.


== Applied ==

Applied microeconomics includes a range of specialized areas of study, many of which draw on methods from other fields.

Economic history examines the evolution of the economy and economic institutions, using methods and techniques from the fields of economics, history, geography, sociology, psychology, and political science.
Education economics examines the organization of education provision and its implication for efficiency and equity, including the effects of education on productivity.
Financial economics examines topics such as the structure of optimal portfolios, the rate of return to capital, econometric analysis of security returns, and corporate financial behavior.
Health economics examines the organization of health care systems, including the role of the health care workforce and health insurance programs.
Industrial organization examines topics such as the entry and exit of firms, innovation, and the role of trademarks.
Law and economics applies microeconomic principles to the selection and enforcement of competing legal regimes and their relative efficiencies.
Political economy examines the role of political institutions in determining policy outcomes.
Public economics examines the design of government tax and expenditure policies and economic effects of these policies (e.g., social insurance programs).
Urban economics, which examines the challenges faced by cities, such as sprawl, air and water pollution, traffic congestion, and poverty, draws on the fields of urban geography and sociology.
Labor economics examines primarily labor markets, but comprises a large range of public policy issues such as immigration, minimum wages, or inequality.

Cork (material),"Cork is a material that is harvested for commercial use primarily from the bark of the Cork Oak tree. As the cork is harvested.
Portugal produces 50% of cork worldwide. Cork is made up of suberin, a hydrophobic substance.
In general, cork is made up of suberin (average of about 40%), lignin (22%), polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) (18%), extractables (15%) and others.


== Properties and uses ==
Cork's elasticity together with its near-impermeability makes it suitable as a material for bottle stoppers, especially for wine bottles. Cork stoppers represent about 60% of all cork based production. Cork's low density makes it a suitable material for fishing floats and buoys, as well as handles for fishing rods (as an alternative to neoprene). Cork is also used in the manufacture of musical instruments, particularly woodwind instruments, where it is used to fasten together different segments of the instrument and make the seams airtight.  
Since cork has suberin in its cell walls, this makes the cells consist of sealed elements. And having sealed elements make it greater for acoustic insulation and even thermal insulation. Sealed elements are capable of trapping and absorbing sound. In short, suberin is mostly responsible for noise reduction! Also, lignin is another constituent of cork. It makes up about 22% of cork. One study says that it’s also associated with soundproofing and thermal insulation! 
The cork industry is generally regarded as environmentally friendly. The sustainability of its production and the easy recycling of cork products and by-products are two of its most distinctive aspects. 
Cork demand has increased due to a larger proportion of wine being sealed with cork rather than being sold in bulk. Top quality corks are quite expensive, so many cheaper brands have switched to lower quality cork, synthetic plastic stoppers, screwcaps, or other closures.

Animation,"Derived from the Latin word for ""soul"", animation is a way of making a movie from many still images. For example, Mickey Mouse was an animation. The images are put together one after another, and then played at a fast speed to give the illusion of movement. 
Animation is a relatively new art form, and though the idea of moving images has been a theme throughout ancient civilizations, it was not until late into the 19th century (1800s, if you don't already know) that experimental animation truly began. Today, the industry of animation is booming, making up a huge commercial enterprise.  
A person who makes animations is called an animator. 
There are at least three ways to animate:

Draw each frame
Use stop-motion: make a model scene and change it to create a new image (frame)
Make computer graphics


== Overview ==

Because it is expensive to make, most animation comes from professional companies. However, independent animators have existed since the 1950s in America, with many of those people entering the professional industry. In Europe, the independent moments has existed since the 1910s, with animators like pre-revolutionary Russia's Ladislas Starevich and Germany's Lotte Reiniger.
Many people use a computer animation program called Adobe Flash to create animations.  Flash uses a combination of drawing and computer graphics to make animations.  Many animations on the internet are made in Flash.  Most animators on the internet do not work for professional companies.
Many television shows, especially those made for children, use limited animation. Companies such as UPA and Hanna-Barbera Productions do this. Simple, limited movement makes the images easier to draw, which allows faster and cheaper production of animation.

Artist's portfolio,"An artist's portfolio (sometimes referred to as a lookbook) is an edited collection of an artist's best artwork intended to showcase their style or method of work. A portfolio is used by artists to show employers their versatility by showing different samples of current work. Typically, the work reflects an artist's best work or a depth in one specific area of work.
Historically, portfolios were printed out and placed into a book. With the increased use of the internet and email, however, there are now websites that host online portfolios that are available to a wider audience.


== Photography ==
A photography portfolio can focus on a single subject. It can be a collection of photographs taken with a certain type of camera, in one geographic area, of one person or a group of people, only black & white or sepia photos, a special event, etc.
Many photographers use portfolios to show their best work when looking for jobs in the photography industry. For example, wedding photographers may put together a book of their best wedding photos to show to engaged couples who are looking for a wedding photographer. Photojournalists may take a collection of their best freelance work with them when looking for a job.


== Artist design book ==
An artist design book is a collection of photographs meant to show off a model, photographer, style, or clothing line.  Sometimes they are made to compile the looks of other people such as a celebrity, politician or socialite. This is an especially popular term with fashion bloggers.
Artist design books, or ADBs, in their online form, can be described as ""fashion diaries"" because bloggers are constantly updating them on a daily or weekly basis. 
It is common for stores or clothing designers to use an ADB to show off products. 


== Web design ==
A web designer portfolio depicts web projects made by the designer. This portfolio is usually made as a website and it shows a front end part of the websites made by the web designer as well as the entire web project made from web designer's website wireframe. 
Such Webdesign Portfolios are even useful for Graphic Designers.
Common elements included in web designer portfolio are:

Web designer's logo – to give recognition of web designer's brand.
Projects created – to show web designer's skill and experience.
Call to action - encouraging impressed visitors to make an enquiry.
Contact information – to help visitors to get in touch with a web designer.
About me / about us page – to show web designer's expertise and team members involved in web development.
Blog – to share web designer's expertise, to engage website visitors to comment blog articles, and for SEO of the web designer's portfolio.
Testimonials - detailing the experience of previous clients.

Scholasticism,"Scholasticism is a way of thinking and teaching knowledge. It was developed in the Middle Ages. It started when people wanted to bring together what is called classical philosophy with the teachings of 
Christian theology. Classical philosophy is the philosophy developed in Ancient Greece. 
Scholasticism is not a philosophy or a theology, but rather a way of teaching and learning. Scholasticism emphasises the use of dialectic. The main purpose of dialectic is to find an answer to a question, or to show that a contradiction can be resolved.
Scholasticism was started by people like Saint Ambrose and St. Augustine. They tried to use philosophy to help explain the doctrine and mysteries of the church. Ambrose and Augustine were among the first Church fathers who brought Christian ideas and Greek philosophy together.
The main figures of scholasticism were Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Bonaventure and, most importantly, Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica is an ambitious synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine.
In the 13th century, the teachings of Aristotle were considered more important than those of Plato. Scholastic education was very much based on written texts, and with arguments for and against ideas in those texts. In this way it differed greatly from modern science, which is based on observations from nature. In Aristotle the scholastics chose someone who was himself quite an original investigator of the natural world. But the scholastics themselves dealt almost entirely with the world in manuscripts written in two ancient languages. One was in Latin, the language of the Vulgate Bible and the other was Ancient Greek. Greek opened the doors to the writings of the Greek philosophers in their own language, at least so far as their works survived. The motto of Boethius “As far as you are able, join faith to reason” reminds us that all scholastics were mediaeval Christians. Their main concern was to see how the Greek ideas could be fitted into their religious view of the world.

Sutton Hoo,"Sutton Hoo is the site of two Anglo-Saxon cemeteries dating to the 6th and early 7th centuries CE that is located near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. One contained an undisturbed ship burial including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding art-historical and archaeological significance, which are now held in the British Museum in London. Other sites had produced significant finds, but had previously been looted.
The ship-burial, probably dating from the early 7th century and excavated in 1939, is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, its meaning, the quality and beauty of its contents, and for the profound interest of the burial ritual itself.

Occluded front,"An occluded front is a weather pattern.  It brings cold weather and leaves cold weather.  It happens when a cold front overtakes a slow-moving warm front.  The cold front is heavier than the warm front and will push it up.  The warm front slides over the cold one.   Cloud and rain form along the occluded front until temperatures become equal as the cold and warm air mix.  Some occluded fronts make tropical cyclogenesis.

Aniforms,"An Aniform is a two-dimensional cartoon character operated like a puppet, to be displayed to live audiences or in visual media. The concept was invented by Morey Bunin with his spouse Charlotte, Bunin being a puppeteer who had worked with string marionettes and hand puppets. The distinctive feature of an Aniforms character is that it displays a physical form that appears ""animated"" on a real or simulated television screen. The technique was used in television production.


== Patent history ==

After forming Aniforms, Inc., Bunin filed for a patent on the process on August 4, 1960, and was granted U.S. Patent 3,070,920 on January 1, 1963.
According to the patent, Aniforms are ""open two-dimensional figures…constructed to simulate many objects."" The figures are flexible to allow free manipulation, which is accomplished by ""rods or wires … attached to the figures"" for both support and movement. The controls are arranged or painted to be invisible to the audience.
Bunin later improved the process to take advantage of emerging Chroma key technology. All background and control surfaces were painted blue, and the black-white signal polarity was reversed without altering the color signals. This resulted in a black outline figure on a white background, which could then be superimposed or keyed on another scene without the object background showing through. Bunin filed for a patent on the improved process on January 20, 1975, and was granted U.S. Patent 3,899,848 on August 19, 1975.


== Application in Television Production ==
The Aniforms process has been used on several television productions:

Captain Kangaroo for the character of ""Fred,"" who appeared on the fictional ""Channel One"" for conversations with The Captain and other human characters.
The Surprise Show, a children's program that was broadcast by WPIX-TV, New York City, from 1965 to 1967. The program featured Aniforms during its first season, but station executives dropped the concept for the run of the show because of the expense. The characters were voiced by Wayland Flowers, Cleavon Little, and Jimmy Boyd.
Acilion et sa bande, a french children's program produced and broadcast by TF1 from 1978 to 1980. The program featured Acilion an Aniform during two season, but station executives dropped the concept because of the expense.
Barney's Army, a children's program produced and broadcast by WPTF-TV 28, Raleigh, North Carolina from 1979 to 1983. Aniforms, Inc. supplied the characters, which were operated and voiced by local actors. A production assistant, Tony Madejczyk, recalled that use of the puppets was subject to non-disclosure agreements, and that when the puppets were not in use ""we had to drape a tarp over the puppet."" Puppets could not be stored at the station when the show was out of production.
Malcolm, a 1983 pilot for a game show co-hosted by Alex Trebek and an Aniforms character named Malcolm. The premise was that three contestants appearing in boxes on a screen alongside Malcolm were asked a question with a two-word answer by Trebek; the first two to ""buzz in"" had to supply the answer, collaboratively, in order. If they failed to do so correctly, Malcolm would offer the third contestant a clue. The pilot was commissioned by NBC, and the show was not picked up.


== Successors ==
""Fred"" and other Aniforms characters are considered more puppet than animation. Their relatively crude, two-dimensional forms and lack of locomotion was appealing primarily because of the illusion of human interaction in real-time with an animated character.
Adam Reed and Matt Thompson founded Floyd County Productions in 2009 after they closed 70/30 Productions following the cancellation of the company's shows. Floyd County Productions grew from a small eight-person studio into a competitive animation house, which produces the animated TV shows Archer, Unsupervised, Chozen, and Dicktown for FX, in addition to providing animation for various live-action shows.
The Late Show host Stephen Colbert and his production company, Spartina Productions, founded Late Night Cartoons, Inc., an animation studio that has collaborated with developers of Adobe Character Animator to produce and provide real-time interactive animations for broadcast. Their topical productions range from a live interview with an animated cartoon version of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016 to several animated series including: Showtime's Our Cartoon President, Paramount+/Comedy Central’s Tooning Out the News, and Comedy Central’s Fairview. Another series, Washingtonia, was announced in October 2021 with a trailer using the process but has not been produced or aired as of 2024.
The Adobe technology uses motion capture to track hand-drawn characters in real-time. In contrast to Aniforms, which requires only a puppeteer and an optional voice artist, it takes ""25 to 30 animators total"" to produce a 10-minute episode in the 24-hour turnaround cycle required before airtime for the concept to stay current.
CrazyTalk and CrazyTalk Animator were used by Network studios in their daily production due to short delivery deadlines and used by television shows like Jimmy Kimmel LIVE! to produce real-time animations for broadcast.
Live2D also can be used to generate real-time 2D animations—usually anime-style characters—using layered, continuous parts based on an illustration, without the need of frame-by-frame animation or a 3D model. This enables characters to move using 2.5D movement while maintaining the original illustration.

Redemptive violence,"Redemptive violence  is defined as a belief that ""violence is a useful mechanism for control and order"", or, alternately, a belief in ""using violence to rid and save the world from evil"". The French Revolution involved violence that was depicted as redemptive by revolutionaries, and decolonization theorist Frantz Fanon was an advocate of redemptive violence. Pacifism rejects the idea that violence can be redemptive.


== Myth ==
The myth of redemptive violence is the story of the victory of order over chaos by means of violence. It is the ideology of conquest, the gods favour those who conquer.
Today’s common understanding of the Myth of Redemptive Violence was put forward by American scholar and theologian Walter Wink in his book, The Powers that Be: Theology for a New Millenium, wherein he defines the Myth of Redemptive Violence as “the belief that violence saves, that war brings peace, that might makes right.”


== Domination system ==
Redemptive violence is the means by which the powers that be support the Domination System; another term coined by Walter Wink. The domination system is described as a network of oppressive relations such as classism, racism, and sexism and the role that violence plays in preserving them. “It is characterized by unjust economic relations, oppressive political relations, biased race relations, patriarchal gender relations, hierarchical power relations, and the use of violence to maintain them all.” 


== In early history ==
The myth of redemptive violence can be traced all the way back into biblical times. For instance, the Babylonian creation story from 1250 BCE follows the same blueprint as virtually every story of redemptive violence put forward today. In this story, known as the Enuma Elish, the god Marduk, defeats the god Tiamat in a fierce battle, and then creates the world using her body. He then uses the blood of another slain god, Qingu to create humans.
Depictions of redemptive violence can also be seen in various art forms throughout early human history.


== In modern culture ==
In describing the Myth of Redemptive Violence, Walter Wink points to the popular 1950s cartoon, Popeye and Bluto, describing the basic plot that is repeated in nearly every episode.  

“In a typical segment, Bluto abducts a screaming and kicking Olive Oyl, Popeye’s girlfriend. When Popeye attempts to rescue her, the massive Bluto beats his diminutive opponent to a pulp, while Olive Oyl helplessly wrings her hands. At the last moment, as our hero oozes to the floor, and Bluto is trying, in effect, to rape Olive Oyl, a can of spinach pops from Popeye’s pocket and spills into his mouth. Transformed by this gracious infusion of power, he easily demolishes the villain and rescues his beloved. The format never varies. Neither party ever gains any insight or learns from these encounters. They never sit down and discuss their differences. Repeated defeats do not teach Bluto to honour Olive Oyl’s humanity, and repeated pummellings do not teach Popeye to swallow his spinach before the fight.”

Wink points out that no matter what happens, Popeye continues to use violence as the only means of solving problems because he never learns that there is another option. He sees violence as a necessity; as the only possible way to solve a problem, and never learns that any other method would solve the problem.

Triptych,"A triptych ( TRIP-tik) is a work of art (usually a panel painting) that is divided into three sections, or three carved panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry.
Beyond its association with art, the term is sometimes used more generally to connote anything with three parts, particularly if integrated into a single unit.


== Etymology ==
The word triptych was formed in English by compounding the prefix tri- with the word diptych. Diptych is borrowed from the Latin diptycha, which itself is derived from the Late Greek δίπτυχα (díptycha) 'pair of writing tablets'. δίπτυχα is the neuter plural of δίπτυχος (díptychos) 'double-folded'.


== In art ==
The triptych form appears in early Christian art, and was a popular standard format for altar paintings from the Middle Ages onwards. Its geographical range was from the eastern Byzantine churches to the Celtic churches in the west. During the Byzantine period, triptychs were often used for private devotional use, along with other relics such as icons. Renaissance painters such as Hans Memling and Hieronymus Bosch used the form. Sculptors also used it. Triptych forms also allow ease of transport.
From the Gothic period onward, both in Europe and elsewhere, altarpieces in churches and cathedrals were often in triptych form. One such cathedral with an altarpiece triptych is Llandaff Cathedral. The Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp, Belgium, contains two examples by Rubens, and Notre Dame de Paris is another example of the use of triptych in architecture. The form is echoed by the structure of many ecclesiastical stained glass windows.
The triptych form's transportability was exploited during World War Two when a private citizens' committee in the United States commissioned painters and sculptors to create portable three-panel hinged altarpieces for use by Christian and Jewish U.S. troops for religious services. By the end of the war, 70 artists had created 460 triptychs. Among the most prolific were Violet Oakley, Nina Barr Wheeler, and Hildreth Meiere.
The triptych format has been used in non-Christian faiths, including, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. For example: the triptych Hilje-j-Sherif displayed at the National Museum of Oriental Art, Rome, Italy, and a page of the Qur'an at the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts in Istanbul, Turkey, exemplify Ottoman religious art adapting the motif.  Likewise, Tibetan Buddhists have used it in traditional altars.
Although strongly identified as a religious altarpiece form, triptychs outside that context have been created, some of the best-known examples being works by Max Beckmann and Francis Bacon. When Bacon's 1969 triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud, was sold in 2013 for $142.4 million, it was the highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction at that time. That record was broken in May 2015 by $179.4 million for Pablo Picasso's 1955 painting Les Femmes d’Alger.


== In photography ==

A photographic triptych is a common style used in modern commercial artwork. The photographs are usually arranged with a plain border between them. The work may consist of separate images that are variants on a theme, or may be one larger image split into three.

Jakarta Enterprise Beans,"Jakarta Enterprise Beans are standardized components inside the Java Enterpise framework. They used to be called  Enterprise Java Beans but they were renamed. They make it easier to build multi-tier applications, which can also be distributed. EJBs are a server-side components, that are used for the business logic of an application. 
There are three different types of these beans:

Entity beans model entities of a database. One such bean has the informartion of one database record.
Session beans model the interactions with the system.
Message-driven beans are there to model messaging systems. This also makes it possible to decouple different systems. The system sending the message does not need to know how to process it.
EJBs also support other Enterprise Java features such as managing  transactions, when needed.


== Practical example ==
Looking at a simple example of a online shop, it is possible to define the different tasks: A client comes along and performs some searches. The result of these searches are stored in stateless session beans. The client then goes, and buys different products. The ""shopping cart"" is modeleled as a stateful session bean. When the client checks out the goods, some data needs to be recorded, such as where to send the goods, or what method of payment to use. This data is later persited to a database, the client will get a way to log in. Usually, entity beans are used for this. To actually perform the checkout, message-driven beans are often used (for example to check if the credit card number is valid, or if the credit card can be used for payment. Finally, the sending of the goods needs to be provided, which is often done by sending messages to other systems.
When they are done in Java, so-called web-services are done using stateless session beans

Geocentrism,"Geocentrism is the belief that the Earth is fixed at the centre of the Universe. Geocentrists accept that the Earth is round. Before the 16th century, most people believed in the theory of geocentrism. From Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. The geocentric was the predominant description of the cosmos in many European ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle in Classical Greece and Ptolemy in Roman Egypt. In about 150 AD, Ptolemy wrote a book to explain in great detail how the spherical Earth is surrounded by things that move in the sky. Ptolemy’s geocentric model was adopted and refined during the Islamic Golden Age, which Muslims believed correlated with the teachings of Islam. From the time of Ptolemy through to the 16th century AD, educated people who knew the Earth is round almost always believed in Ptolemy’s geocentric theory.
From the 15th to the 17th century, astronomers, especially Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, found evidence that the Earth is not fixed but moves round the Sun. That is called heliocentrism.

Bean machine,"The bean machine, also known as the quincunx or Galton box, is a machine invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the law of error and the normal distribution.
The machine consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins. Balls are dropped from the top, and bounce left and right as they hit the pins. Eventually, they are collected into one-ball-wide bins at the bottom. The height of ball columns in the bins approximates a bell curve.
Overlaying Pascal's triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each pin. 
A large-scale working model of this device can be seen at the Museum of Science, Boston.",0
Comparative theology,"Comparative theology is a relatively new discipline within theology, which holds together ""comparative"" and ""theology"" in creative tension. It represents a particular type of theological practice committed to deep interreligious learning (""comparative"") while staying rooted in a particular religious tradition (""theology""). Moreover, while many of its proponents come from the Christian religious tradition, it can have as a starting point the theology of any religious tradition.


== Relations to other disciplines ==

Francis X. Clooney, a leading figure within comparative theology, sees comparative theology essentially as ""faith seeking understanding"". He explains the distinctiveness of comparative theology by clarifying the relationship between comparative theology and the related disciplines of comparative religion, theology of religions, and interreligious dialogue.


=== Comparative theology vs. comparative religion ===
Comparative theology shares with comparative religion an interest in the comparative study of religion. However, in contrast to comparative religion, which seeks to examine the similarities and differences between a variety of religious traditions from a neutral point of view, comparative theology focuses on the theological reflection of one's own religion in light of the insights from another religious tradition. Rather than emphasizing a religiously-detached position, comparative theology is deeply rooted in a particular religious tradition. Francis X. Clooney explains:

Comparative theology – comparative and theological beginning to end – marks acts of faith seeking understanding which are rooted in a particular faith tradition but which, from that foundation, venture into learning from one or more other faith traditions. This learning is sought for the sake of fresh theological insights that are indebted to the newly encountered tradition/s as well as the home tradition.


=== Comparative theology vs. theology of religion ===
Comparative theology shares with theology of religions a theological interest in the encounter between Christian faith and other religions; but from a different angle, and with a different emphasis and aim. Theology of religion attempts to clarify the relationship between Christian faith and other religious traditions with regard to how other religions can be understood in light of normative claims of Christian faith, in particular, related to salvation and Christ. Theology of religion thus reflects from Christian theological claims, based on general descriptions of other religious traditions. In contrast to this, comparative theology is a theology of religious learning. It emphasizes an in-depth study of the particularities of other religious traditions instead of basing itself on general descriptions. ""Comparative theology is not primarily about which religion is the true one, but about learning across religious borders in a way that discloses the truth of my faith, in the light of their faith.""


=== Comparative theology vs. interreligious dialogue ===
Comparative theology shares with interreligious dialogue a commitment to engage in dialogue and listen carefully to the religious other. It must, however, go further than just listening: ""The comparative theologian must do more than listen to others explain their faith; she must be willing to study their traditions deeply alongside her own, taking both to heart.""


== Sources and methodology ==
The unique character of comparative theology derives from its sources and methodology.

Comparative theology works with two types of religious sources. While rooted in one tradition, comparative theology has its foundation also in at least one additional religious tradition. Clooney describes comparative theology. . . as truly constructive theology, distinguished by its sources and ways of proceeding, by its foundation in more than one tradition (although the comparativist always remains rooted in one tradition), and by reflection which builds on that foundation, rather than simply on themes or by methods already articulated prior to comparative practice.

Comparative theology is dialectical practice. The comparison starts with a critical study of the other religion. This first step involves a persistent and disciplined in-depth study of the other religious tradition where the theologian exposes herself to the sacred texts of the other tradition. The comparative theologian practices ""hermeneutical openness"" in a manner where comprehension should precede judgment. This implies a ""bracketing"" of subjective commitments / theological judgments, allowing the other religious tradition to speak as much as possible on its own terms. It is a practice of making oneself ""vulnerable to intellectual, imaginative, affective transformation.""

The comparison, in turn, becomes a conversation with your own tradition. The insights emerging from the encounter with the other religious tradition might influence the conceptual framework for interpreting your own tradition, causing a reconsideration of your Christian identity. Correlations are made between the two traditions, which might imply recognition of similarities or recognition of differences. At this point ""the 'normative theological judgments' that were temporarily suspended are brought back into the hermeneutical circle."" Grounds are provided for raising more profound theological questions, conversation with other theologians, and potentially leading to new theological construction. This theological procedure resonates with Clooney's claim thatComparative theology is a theology deeply changed by its attention to the details of multiple religious and theological traditions, a theology that occurs only after comparison.Contemporary theology has, so far, been mainly a text-based discipline, and comparative theologians engage primarily with texts from one religious tradition outside their own, due to the in-depth study that is required. Although associated with Christian theology, the approach applied in comparative theology is not particularly Christian and can be a practiced grounded in other religious traditions as well.


== History and key figures ==

Comparative theology has historical forerunners in figures such as the Jesuit missionaries Francis Xavier and Roberto de Nobili.
Since the 1980s, comparative theology has developed as a particular theological response to the growing religious diversity in the contemporary world. It has been introduced by Francis X. Clooney and James L. Fredericks, and is a methodology used by individuals such as David Tracy, Keith Ward, and Robert C. Neville. The discipline arose through the growing impact of Alan Race's three-fold understanding of theology of religions, that resulted in various arguments about the benefits of the models of theology of religions.
A new generation of comparative theologians is today expanding the discourse, drawing it in new directions.

Wire sculpture,"Wire sculpture is the creation of sculpture  out of wire. The use of metal wire in jewelry dates back to the 2nd Dynasty in Egypt and to the Bronze and Iron Ages in Europe. In the 20th century, the works of Alexander Calder, Ruth Asawa, and other modern practitioners developed the medium of wire sculpture as an art form.


== Alexander Calder ==
Alexander Calder (July 22,1898–November 11,1976), an American sculptor, greatly developed the use of wire as a medium for sculpture with his kinetic and movement-based Cirque Calder, as well as pieces such as Two Acrobats, Romulus and Remus, and Hercules and Lion.
In 1926, after a stint spent making toys at the request of a Serbian toy merchant in Paris, Calder began creating his Cirque Calder, a miniature, movable circus that uses movable wire models of various circus performers, like sword eaters and lion tamers. After this, Calder created complete pieces only using wire and in 1927 had a show of wire sculptures at the Weyhe Gallery in New York City. In 1930, he had a solo show of wire sculptures in Paris, at Galerie Billiet.
Calder’s wire sculptures of this period tended to be portraits, caricatures, and stylized representations of people and animals. While originally believing the medium of wire sculpture to be merely clever and amusing, as his work developed, he began to state that wire sculpture had an important place in the history of art and remarked on the great possibilities within the medium.“These new studies in wire, however, did not remain the simple, modest little things I had done in New York. They are still simple, more simple than before, and therein lie the great possibilities which I have only recently come to feel for the wire medium...
There is one thing, in particular, which connects them with history. One of the futuristic painters' canons, as propounded by Modigliani, was that objects should not be lost to view but should be shown through the others by making the latter transparent. The wire sculpture accomplishes this in a most decided manner!""


== Ruth Asawa ==
Ruth Asawa came to prominence when her wire sculptures appeared at both the Whitney Museum of American Art and the 1955 São Paulo Art Biennial. Asawa learned to use commonplace materials from Josef Albers, her teacher at Black Mountain College, and began experimenting with wire using a variety of techniques.
In the 1950s, Asawa experimented with crocheted wire sculptures of abstract forms that appear as three dimensional line drawings. She learned the basic technique while in Toluca, Mexico, where villagers used a similar technique to make baskets from galvanized wire.

 “I was interested in it because of the economy of a line, making something in space, enclosing it without blocking it out. It’s still transparent. I realized that if I was going to make these forms, which interlock and interweave, it can only be done with a line because a line can go anywhere.” 

In 1962, Asawa began experimenting with tied wire sculptures of images rooted in nature, geometry, and abstraction.


== Contemporary practitioners ==
Contemporary wire artists include:

Brian Boyer uses wire that would otherwise end up in a landfill to create wire trees. Known for his self-taught style and use of recycled copper/aluminum wire. His trees combine mathematical formulas, algorithms, and equations along with geometric shapes along with flowers and many other abstract patterns in the roots and branches. As of 2018 Brian has had an active profile with the ""Canadian Council for the Arts"" and continues to make his one of a kind wire trees under the brand name ""Forrest Wire""
Gavin Worth has used wire sculpture to combine realistic images with 3-d abstract forms. Worth approached Calder's idea of mobility in sculpture by making the viewer the mobile element. By placing varying images on different planes of the sculpture, the image changes as the viewer see it from different angles.
Kue King has built a reputation combining wire and feather. He sculpts wire using a woven additive technique. Instead of creating a form with wireframing, he builds with it like clay.
Elizabeth Berrien began working with wire in the 1960s and is hailed as the ""Godmother of Wire"" by the wave of emerging wire sculptors she inspired.
Racso Jugarap works speak of organic volume and fluidity. Other than wire sculpture and installations, the artist also experiments with wearable wire arts.

Robin Wight creates wire sculptures of fairies. He works with stainless steel wire. One of his more notable works is Dancing with Dandelions

Inclusivism,"Inclusivism is one of several approaches in religious studies, anthropology, or civics to understand the relationship between different religions, societies, cultures, political factions etc. It asserts that there is beauty in the variety of different schools of thoughts, and that they can live together in harmony. It stands in contrast to exclusivism, which asserts that only one way is true and all others are erroneous. 
Within religious studies and theology, inclusivism is the belief that, although only one belief system is true, aspects of its truth can be found in other religions. This is contrasted from religious pluralism, which asserts that all beliefs are equally valid within a believer's particular context.
Broadly speaking, there are two schools of Inclusivist thought:

Relativistic inclusivism, which asserts that the believer's own views are true only in their particular context, and believers of other traditions have their own validity.
Absolutist inclusivism, which asserts that an unknown set of assertions are Absolutely True, that no human being currently living has yet ascertained absolute truth, but that all human beings have partially ascertained absolute truth.


== By religion ==


=== Ancient Greece ===
Interpretatio graeca was the tendency of ancient Greek writers to equate foreign divinities to members of their own pantheon. Herodotus, for example, refers to the ancient Egyptian gods Amon, Osiris, and Ptah as ""Zeus,"" ""Dionysus,"" and ""Hephaestus."" This could be seen an example of inclusivism, as could syncretism.
Syncretism functioned as an essential feature of Ancient Greek religion. Later on, Hellenism, a consequence of Alexander the Great's belief that he was the son of a god, reinforced by the Oracle of Zeus-Ammon at Siwa in Egypt, itself showed syncretic features, essentially blending Persian, Anatolian, Egyptian (and eventually Etruscan-Roman) elements within Hellenic formulations. After the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture initiated by Ptolemy I Soter, Isis became known as ""Queen of Heaven"" and worshipped in many aspects and by many names besides that of Hera.


=== Hinduism ===
A well-known Rig Vedic hymn stemming from Hinduism claims that ""Truth is One, though the sages know it variously"", proclaiming a pluralistic view of religion. Krishna, incarnation or Avatar of Vishnu, the supreme God in Hinduism, said in the Gita, ""In whatever way men identify with Me, in the same way do I carry out their desires; men pursue My path... in all ways"" (Gita:4:11). He also said that ""Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, I make his faith steady. However, their wishes are only granted by Me"" (Gita: 7:21–22). Another quote in the Gita states: ""O Arjuna, even those devotees who worship other lesser deities (e.g., Devas, for example) with faith, they also worship Me, but in an improper way because I am the Supreme Being. I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services (Seva, Yajna) and Lord of the universe"" (Gita: 9:23).


=== Christianity ===

Inclusive Christianity, also called inclusive theology, is an interpretation of the Bible that maintains that God desires and has the power to save individuals irrespective of the tradition in which they are born. Some Christian supporters of the inclusive view make a distinction between Christians and believers in maintaining that all Christians are believers, however, not all believers are Christians. In this line of thought, Christians are believers in the one and only universal truth and they follow and confess it under the biblical name that is “Jesus Christ”. At the same time, they argue, some non-Christian believers of other religions, traditions, and disciplines would trust at least partially in the very same one and only truth but under a different linguistic name. Inclusive Christians support these claims by citing certain passages from the bible. Inclusive theology is rooted in a larger growing movement called ""interfaith"" which aims to create unity among various religions. The inclusive interpretation is a minority view in some churches yet considered an official theological doctrine in others.
Christian supporters of inclusivism include Augustus Hopkins Strong, C. S. Lewis,  Clark Pinnock, Karl Rahner, John E. Sanders, Terrance L. Tiessen, and Robert Brush (contributor to The Arminian Magazine). While Billy Graham mostly preached ""salvation by faith in Christ alone"" throughout his 60-year ministry as an evangelist, he later made controversial comments that border on inclusivism (although he stated that he did not like to refer to it by that term, because he was concerned that many people mean universalism when they refer to inclusivism). Graham said, “I used to play God but I can’t do that any more. I used to believe that pagans in far-off countries were lost and were going to hell—if they did not have the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them. I no longer believe that,” he said carefully. “I believe that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God—through nature, for instance—and plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying ’yes’ to God.”
Some Evangelical and Reformed Protestant scholars believe that God judges all people based on their response to the Holy Spirit, citing Romans 2:14-15 as evidence that those following a natural moral law are still following God. Others have interpreted this text in an additional inclusive manner in the way that non-Christians also naturally (given by nature) carry a part of the wisdom of God in their hearts as part of themselves. In a similar manner they furthermore interpret Genesis 20, 9-11 as well as 1 Corinthians 5,1 as they would show examples of non-Christians or non-Jews that – based on their naturally given knowledge of the Law of God – would live out more god-pleasing lives than jews and Christians often would live. In Romans 1, 19-20 it is often argued by inclusive Christians that this description would imply that God – in parts – can be recognized by any human being no matter its Religion or cultural background as well as independent from its geographic and/or its chronologic whereabouts. This would include as well the domain of modern science as it studies the universe (rel. the creation) as implied in Psalm 19,2-4. Other verses cited as supporting inclusivism include Acts 17:23-28, wherein Paul says that the (pagan) Greeks had been worshiping God without knowing it, and that their poets have partially recognized the true nature of God. Inclusive Christians from different denominations furthermore argue that in Colossians 1,16 it would be mentioned that the universe – through its creatureliness – is part of the being of God: the ground-structure of the universe would be part of the eternal reality and being of Christ. Another biblical verse inclusive believers use is Acts 10:1-48, which would state that whoever fears God and does good works is accepted by him, regardless of nation. In addition, the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats (Matthew 25:31-46) portrays the judgment of the nations as being based on each individual's compassion on others, not on their religious background. Finally it is sometimes argued that the inner connection between the biblical verses from Gen 2,7 and Gen 7, 21-22 would be a definite proof that every living organism would carry essential parts of the living God inside itself: namely through the living breath of God.
Although these inclusive interpretations of the Bible as they are believed to be understood by many inclusive Christians state, that God – partially – can be experienced and found in other religions and/or disciplines such as science for example, they still normally mention that – at the same time – to fully experience the deepest and most intimate relationship with God it would be crucially necessary to find and unite with the reality and person of Jesus and therefore not only with the reality of the Universal Christ. At the same time, it is stated, that to fully be in relationship with God it also would be necessary to accept the inclusive and universal nature of the Christ and of God as a whole and therefore not only the relationship to a as internally concentrated believed and experienced Jesus.
The doctrine of inclusivism is held by Unitarian Universalism which is considered a protestant denomination, some Roman Catholics  and Seventh-day Adventists, asserting that while Christianity is the one true faith, other faiths are at least partially true.
An alternative use for the term ""inclusive theology"" has to do with a movement called feminist theology which aims to include more women into religious clergy roles that has been historically unavailable to women.
Out of an inclusivistic / inclusive theological attitude believed in a faith-community can grow corresponding religious / spiritual / ecclesiastical / interdisciplinary institutions. Examples of this are the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the Pontifical Council for Culture or the Pontificial Council for Interreligious Dialogue. In all of these institutions of the Catholic Church the relationships to these other disciplines and religions are fostered because of the basic inclusivistic / inclusive theological understanding of the Bible. 


=== Baháʼí Faith ===
Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated:

The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá'u'lláh, the followers of His Faith firmly believe, is that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society.

Souvenir spoon,"A souvenir spoon is a decorative spoon used as a memento of a place or to display as a 'trophy' of having been there. The spoons may be made from a number of different materials such as sterling silver, nickel, steel, and in some cases wood. They are often hung on a spoon rack and are typically ornamental, depicting sights, coat of arms, associated characters, etc. The year the spoon was made may be inscribed in the bowl, or on the back. The entire spoon, including the bowl, handle, and finial may be used to convey the theme.
The first souvenir spoons in the United States were made in 1890 by Galt & Bros., Inc. of Washington D.C., featuring the profile of George Washington. Although the George Washington spoon was one of the most popular designs, relatively few made by Galt & Bro. remain in circulation. One year later, a souvenir Salem Witch spoon was made, and sold seven thousand copies. It was created by Daniel Low, a jeweler in Salem, Massachusetts, after he saw souvenir spoons on vacation in Germany. The Witch Spoon is given credit for starting the souvenir spoon hobby in the U.S.

Health effects of wood smoke,"Smoke is a suspension of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes. It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative.

Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products.
Smoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.


== Chemical composition ==
The composition of smoke depends on the nature of the burning fuel and the conditions of combustion. Fires with high availability of oxygen burn at a high temperature and with a small amount of smoke produced; the particles are mostly composed of ash, or with large temperature differences, of condensed aerosol of water. High temperature also leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur content yields sulfur dioxide, or in case of incomplete combustion, hydrogen sulfide. Carbon and hydrogen are almost completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Fires burning with lack of oxygen produce a significantly wider palette of compounds, many of them toxic. Partial oxidation of carbon produces carbon monoxide, while nitrogen-containing materials can yield hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen gas can be produced instead of water. Contents of halogens such as chlorine (e.g. in polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants) may lead to the production of hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, and chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons. Hydrogen fluoride can be formed from fluorocarbons, whether fluoropolymers subjected to fire or halocarbon fire suppression agents. Phosphorus and antimony oxides and their reaction products can be formed from some fire retardant additives, increasing smoke toxicity and corrosivity. Pyrolysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), e.g. from burning older transformer oil, and to lower degree also of other chlorine-containing materials, can produce 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. Pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, e.g. teflon, in presence of oxygen yields carbonyl fluoride (which hydrolyzes readily to HF and CO2); other compounds may be formed as well, e.g. carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and highly toxic perfluoroisobutene (PFIB).

Pyrolysis of burning material, especially incomplete combustion or smoldering without adequate oxygen supply, also results in production of a large amount of hydrocarbons, both aliphatic (methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene) and aromatic (benzene and its derivates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; e.g. benzo[a]pyrene, studied as a carcinogen, or retene), terpenes. It also results in the emission of a range of smaller oxygenated volatile organic compounds (methanol, acetic acid, hydroxy acetone, methyl acetate and ethyl formate) which are formed as combustion by products as well as less volatile oxygenated organic species such as phenolics, furans and furanones. Heterocyclic compounds may be also present. Heavier hydrocarbons may condense as tar; smoke with significant tar content is yellow to brown. Combustion of solid fuels can result in the emission of many hundreds to thousands of lower volatility organic compounds in the aerosol phase. Presence of such smoke, soot, and/or brown oily deposits during a fire indicates a possible hazardous situation, as the atmosphere may be saturated with combustible pyrolysis products with concentration above the upper flammability limit, and sudden inrush of air can cause flashover or backdraft.
Presence of sulfur can lead to formation of gases like hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon disulfide, and thiols; especially thiols tend to get adsorbed on surfaces and produce a lingering odor even long after the fire. Partial oxidation of the released hydrocarbons yields in a wide palette of other compounds: aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde, acrolein, and furfural), ketones, alcohols (often aromatic, e.g. phenol, guaiacol, syringol, catechol, and cresols), carboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, etc.).
The visible particulate matter in such smokes is most commonly composed of carbon (soot). Other particulates may be composed of drops of condensed tar, or solid particles of ash. The presence of metals in the fuel yields particles of metal oxides. Particles of inorganic salts may also be formed, e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or sodium chloride. Inorganic salts present on the surface of the soot particles may make them hydrophilic. Many organic compounds, typically the aromatic hydrocarbons, may be also adsorbed on the surface of the solid particles. Metal oxides can be present when metal-containing fuels are burned, e.g. solid rocket fuels containing aluminium. Depleted uranium projectiles after impacting the target ignite, producing particles of uranium oxides. Magnetic particles, spherules of magnetite-like ferrous ferric oxide, are present in coal smoke; their increase in deposits after 1860 marks the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. (Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be also produced in the smoke from meteorites burning in the atmosphere.) Magnetic remanence, recorded in the iron oxide particles, indicates the strength of Earth's magnetic field when they were cooled beyond their Curie temperature; this can be used to distinguish magnetic particles of terrestrial and meteoric origin. Fly ash is composed mainly of silica and calcium oxide. Cenospheres are present in smoke from liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Minute metal particles produced by abrasion can be present in engine smokes. Amorphous silica particles are present in smokes from burning silicones; small proportion of silicon nitride particles can be formed in fires with insufficient oxygen. The silica particles have about 10 nm size, clumped to 70–100 nm aggregates and further agglomerated to chains. Radioactive particles may be present due to traces of uranium, thorium, or other radionuclides in the fuel; hot particles can be present in case of fires during nuclear accidents (e.g. Chernobyl disaster) or nuclear war.
Smoke particulates, like other aerosols, are categorized into three modes based on particle size:

nuclei mode, with geometric mean radius between 2.5 and 20 nm, likely forming by condensation of carbon moieties.
accumulation mode, ranging between 75 and 250 nm and formed by coagulation of nuclei mode particles
coarse mode, with particles in micrometer range
Most of the smoke material is primarily in coarse particles. Those undergo rapid dry precipitation, and the smoke damage in more distant areas outside of the room where the fire occurs is therefore primarily mediated by the smaller particles.
Aerosol of particles beyond visible size is an early indicator of materials in a preignition stage of a fire.
Burning of hydrogen-rich fuel produces water vapor; this results in smoke containing droplets of water. In absence of other color sources (nitrogen oxides, particulates...), such smoke is white and cloud-like.
Smoke emissions may contain characteristic trace elements. Vanadium is present in emissions from oil fired power plants and refineries; oil plants also emit some nickel. Coal combustion produces emissions containing aluminium, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, selenium, and uranium.
Traces of vanadium in high-temperature combustion products form droplets of molten vanadates. These attack the passivation layers on metals and cause high temperature corrosion, which is a concern especially for internal combustion engines. Molten sulfate and lead particulates also have such effect.
Some components of smoke are characteristic of the combustion source. Guaiacol and its derivatives are products of pyrolysis of lignin and are characteristic of wood smoke; other markers are syringol and derivates, and other methoxy phenols. Retene, a product of pyrolysis of conifer trees, is an indicator of forest fires. Levoglucosan is a pyrolysis product of cellulose. Hardwood vs softwood smokes differ in the ratio of guaiacols/syringols. Markers for vehicle exhaust include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes, steranes, and specific nitroarenes (e.g. 1-nitropyrene). The ratio of hopanes and steranes to elemental carbon can be used to distinguish between emissions of gasoline and diesel engines.
Many compounds can be associated with particulates; whether by being adsorbed on their surfaces, or by being dissolved in liquid droplets. Hydrogen chloride is well absorbed in the soot particles.
Inert particulate matter can be disturbed and entrained into the smoke. Of particular concern are particles of asbestos.
Deposited hot particles of radioactive fallout and bioaccumulated radioisotopes can be reintroduced into the atmosphere by wildfires and forest fires; this is a concern in e.g. the Zone of alienation containing contaminants from the Chernobyl disaster.
Polymers are a significant source of smoke. Aromatic side groups, e.g. in polystyrene, enhance generation of smoke. Aromatic groups integrated in the polymer backbone produce less smoke, likely due to significant charring. Aliphatic polymers tend to generate the least smoke, and are non-self-extinguishing. However presence of additives can significantly increase smoke formation. Phosphorus-based and halogen-based flame retardants decrease production of smoke. Higher degree of cross-linking between the polymer chains has such effect too.


=== Visible and invisible particles of combustion ===

The naked eye detects particle sizes greater than 7 μm (micrometres). Visible particles emitted from a fire are referred to as smoke. Invisible particles are generally referred to as gas or fumes. This is best illustrated when toasting bread in a toaster. As the bread heats up, the products of combustion increase in size. The fumes initially produced are invisible but become visible if the toast is burnt.
An ionization chamber type smoke detector is technically a product of combustion detector, not a smoke detector. Ionization chamber type smoke detectors detect particles of combustion that are invisible to the naked eye. This explains why they may frequently false alarm from the fumes emitted from the red-hot heating elements of a toaster, before the presence of visible smoke, yet they may fail to activate in the early, low-heat smoldering stage of a fire.
Smoke from a typical house fire contains hundreds of different chemicals and fumes. As a result, the damage caused by the smoke can often exceed that caused by the actual heat of the fire. In addition to the physical damage caused by the smoke of a fire – which manifests itself in the form of stains – is the often even harder to eliminate problem of a smoky odor. Just as there are contractors that specialize in rebuilding/repairing homes that have been damaged by fire and smoke, fabric restoration companies specialize in restoring fabrics that have been damaged in a fire.


== Dangers ==
Smoke from oxygen-deprived fires contains a significant concentration of compounds that are flammable. A cloud of smoke, in contact with atmospheric oxygen, therefore has the potential of being ignited – either by another open flame in the area, or by its own temperature. This leads to effects like backdraft and flashover. Smoke inhalation is also a danger of smoke that can cause serious injury and death.

Many compounds of smoke from fires are highly toxic and/or irritating. The most dangerous is carbon monoxide leading to carbon monoxide poisoning, sometimes with the additive effects of hydrogen cyanide and phosgene. Smoke inhalation can therefore quickly lead to incapacitation and loss of consciousness. Sulfur oxides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride in contact with moisture form sulfuric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid, which are corrosive to both lungs and materials. When asleep the nose does not sense smoke nor does the brain, but the body will wake up if the lungs become enveloped in smoke and the brain will be stimulated and the person will be awoken. This does not work if the person is incapacitated or under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

Cigarette smoke is a major modifiable risk factor for lung disease, heart disease, and many cancers.  Smoke is a significant component of ambient air pollution, often resulting from the burning of coal in power plants, forest fires, agricultural burning, and other sources of combustion. Ambient air pollution typically contains particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and other harmful substances, but the concentration of pollutants is generally lower than in cigarette smoke. However, prolonged exposure to ambient pollutants, especially particulate matter like PM2.5, can still pose serious health risks. For example, one day of exposure to PM2.5 at a concentration of 880 μg/m³ can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Long-term exposure to elevated PM2.5 levels is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, and heart disease. Additionally, PM2.5 particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, exacerbating health risks. Climate change can also worsen the frequency and intensity of pollution sources like wildfires, leading to higher concentrations of PM2.5 in certain regions. Such as occurs in Beijing, China, is the equivalent of smoking one or two cigarettes in terms of particulate inhalation by weight. The analysis is complicated, however, by the fact that the organic compounds present in various ambient particulates may have a higher carcinogenicity than the compounds in cigarette smoke particulates. Secondhand tobacco smoke is the combination of both sidestream and mainstream smoke emissions from a burning tobacco product. These emissions contain more than 50 carcinogenic chemicals. According to the United States Surgeon General's 2006 report on the subject, ""Short exposures to secondhand [tobacco] smoke can cause blood platelets to become stickier, damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart variability, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack"". The American Cancer Society lists ""heart disease, lung infections, increased asthma attacks, middle ear infections, and low birth weight"" as ramifications of smoker's emission.

 
Smoke can obscure visibility, impeding occupant exiting from fire areas. In fact, the poor visibility due to the smoke that was in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire in Worcester, Massachusetts was the reason why the trapped rescue firefighters could not evacuate the building in time. Because of the striking similarity that each floor shared, the dense smoke caused the firefighters to become disoriented.


=== Corrosion ===
Smoke can contain a wide variety of chemicals, many of them aggressive in nature. Examples are hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, produced from halogen-containing plastics and fire retardants, hydrofluoric acid released by pyrolysis of fluorocarbon fire suppression agents, sulfuric acid from burning of sulfur-containing materials, nitric acid from high-temperature fires where nitrous oxide gets formed, phosphoric acid and antimony compounds from P and Sb based fire retardants, and many others. Such corrosion is not significant for structural materials, but delicate structures, especially microelectronics, are strongly affected. Corrosion of circuit board traces, penetration of aggressive chemicals through the casings of parts, and other effects can cause an immediate or gradual deterioration of parameters or even premature (and often delayed, as the corrosion can progress over long time) failure of equipment subjected to smoke. Many smoke components are also electrically conductive; deposition of a conductive layer on the circuits can cause crosstalks and other deteriorations of the operating parameters or even cause short circuits and total failures. Electrical contacts can be affected by corrosion of surfaces, and by deposition of soot and other conductive particles or nonconductive layers on or across the contacts. Deposited particles may adversely affect the performance of optoelectronics by absorbing or scattering the light beams.
Corrosivity of smoke produced by materials is characterized by the corrosion index (CI), defined as material loss rate (angstrom/minute) per amount of material gasified products (grams) per volume of air (m3). It is measured by exposing strips of metal to flow of combustion products in a test tunnel. Polymers containing halogen and hydrogen (polyvinyl chloride, polyolefins with halogenated additives, etc.) have the highest CI as the corrosive acids are formed directly with water produced by the combustion, polymers containing halogen only (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene) have lower CI as the formation of acid is limited to reactions with airborne humidity, and halogen-free materials (polyolefins, wood) have the lowest CI. However, some halogen-free materials can also release significant amount of corrosive products.
Smoke damage to electronic equipment can be significantly more extensive than the fire itself. Cable fires are of special concern; low smoke zero halogen materials are preferable for cable insulation.
When smoke comes into contact with the surface of any substance or structure, the chemicals contained in it are transferred to it. The corrosive properties of the chemicals cause the substance or structure to decompose at a rapid rate. Certain materials or structures absorb these chemicals, which is why clothing, unsealed surfaces, potable water, piping, wood, etc., are replaced in most cases of structural fires.


=== Health effects of wood smoke ===

Wood smoke is a major source of air pollution, especially particulate pollution, pollution by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde.
In the United Kingdom domestic combustion, especially for industrial uses, is the largest single source of PM2.5 annually. In some towns and cities in New South Wales, wood smoke may be responsible for 60% of fine particle air pollution in the winter. A year-long sampling campaign in Athens, Greece found a third (31%) of PAH urban air pollution to be caused by wood-burning, roughly as much as that of diesel and oil (33%) and gasoline (29%). It also found that wood-burning is responsible for nearly half (43%) of annual PAH lung cancer-risk compared to the other sources and that wintertime PAH levels were 7 times higher than in other seasons, presumably due to an increased use of fireplaces and heaters. The largest exposure events are periods during the winter with reduced atmospheric dispersion to dilute the accumulated pollution, in particular due to the low wind speeds. Research conducted about biomass burning in 2015, estimated that 38% of European total particulate pollution emissions are composed of domestic wood burning.
Wood smoke (for example from wildfires or wood ovens) can cause lung damage, artery damage and DNA damage leading to cancer, other respiratory and lung disease and cardiovascular disease. Air pollution, particulate matter and wood smoke may also cause brain damage because of particulates breaching the cardiovascular system and into the brain, which can increase the risk of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders mental disorders, and suicidal behavior, although studies on the link between depression and some air pollutants are not consistent. At least one study has identified ""the abundant presence in the human brain of magnetite nanoparticles that match precisely the high-temperature magnetite nanospheres, formed by combustion and/or friction-derived heating, which are prolific in urban, airborne particulate matter (PM)."" Air pollution has also been linked to a range of other psychosocial problems.


== Measurement ==
As early as the 15th century Leonardo da Vinci commented at length on the difficulty of assessing smoke, and distinguished between black smoke (carbonized particles) and white 'smoke' which is not a smoke at all but merely a suspension of harmless water particulates.
Smoke from heating appliances is commonly measured in one of the following ways:
In-line capture. A smoke sample is simply sucked through a filter which is weighed before and after the test and the mass of smoke found. This is the simplest and probably the most accurate method, but can only be used where the smoke concentration is slight, as the filter can quickly become blocked.
The ASTM smoke pump is a simple and widely used method of in-line capture where a measured volume of smoke is pulled through a filter paper and the dark spot so formed is compared with a standard.
Filter/dilution tunnel. A smoke sample is drawn through a tube where it is diluted with air, the resulting smoke/air mixture is then pulled through a filter and weighed. This is the internationally recognized method of measuring smoke from combustion.
Electrostatic precipitation. The smoke is passed through an array of metal tubes which contain suspended wires. A (huge) electrical potential is applied across the tubes and wires so that the smoke particles become charged and are attracted to the sides of the tubes. This method can over-read by capturing harmless condensates, or under-read due to the insulating effect of the smoke. However, it is the necessary method for assessing volumes of smoke too great to be forced through a filter, i.e., from bituminous coal.
Ringelmann scale. A measure of smoke color. Invented by Professor Maximilian Ringelmann in Paris in 1888, it is essentially a card with squares of black, white and shades of gray which is held up and the comparative grayness of the smoke judged. Highly dependent on light conditions and the skill of the observer it allocates a grayness number from 0 (white) to 5 (black) which has only a passing relationship to the actual quantity of smoke. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the Ringelmann scale means that it has been adopted as a standard in many countries.
Optical scattering. A light beam is passed through the smoke. A light detector is situated at an angle to the light source, typically at 90°, so that it receives only light reflected from passing particles. A measurement is made of the light received which will be higher as the concentration of smoke particles becomes higher.
Optical obscuration. A light beam is passed through the smoke and a detector opposite measures the light. The more smoke particles are present between the two, the less light will be measured.
Combined optical methods. There are various proprietary optical smoke measurement devices such as the 'nephelometer' or the 'aethalometer' which use several different optical methods, including more than one wavelength of light, inside a single instrument and apply an algorithm to give a good estimate of smoke. It has been claimed that these devices can differentiate types of smoke and so their probable source can be inferred, though this is disputed.
Inference from carbon monoxide. Smoke is incompletely burned fuel, carbon monoxide is incompletely burned carbon, therefore it has long been assumed that measurement of CO in flue gas (a cheap, simple and very accurate procedure) will provide a good indication of the levels of smoke. Indeed, several jurisdictions use CO measurement as the basis of smoke control. However it is far from clear how accurate the correspondence is.


== Medicinal smoking ==

Throughout recorded history, humans have used the smoke of medicinal plants to cure illness. A sculpture from Persepolis shows Darius the Great (522–486 BC), the king of Persia, with two censers in front of him for burning Peganum harmala and/or sandalwood Santalum album, which was believed to protect the king from evil and disease. More than 300 plant species in 5 continents are used in smoke form for different diseases. As a method of drug administration, smoking is important as it is a simple, inexpensive, but very effective method of extracting particles containing active agents. More importantly, generating smoke reduces the particle size to a microscopic scale thereby increasing the absorption of its active chemical principles.

Bug (engineering),"In engineering, a bug is a design defect in an engineered system that causes an undesired result.
Although used exclusively to describe a technical issue, bug is a non-technical term; applicable without technical understanding of the system.
The term bug applies exclusively to a system that is (human) designed; not to a natural system; and that the issue is within the influence of human control. For example, humans have faults but not bugs, and a server crash due to natural disaster is not a bug.
In addition to or instead of defect, some use: error, flaw or fault.
Engineered systems is a broad classification encompassing but not limited to: software, computer hardware, electronics, circuitry and machinery.
The undesirable result can be classified and described many ways including: intermittent, transient, glitch, crash or hang.
Since desirability is subjective, what is considered undesirable to one may be considered desirable to another; even a useful feature.


== History ==
The Middle English word bugge is the basis for the terms bugbear and bugaboo as terms used for a monster.
The term bug to describe a defect has been engineering jargon since at least as far back as the 1870s – long before electronic computers and computer software. For instance, Thomas Edison wrote the following words in a letter to an associate in 1878:

It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise—this thing gives out and [it is] then that ""Bugs""—as such little faults and difficulties are called—show themselves and months of intense watching, study and labor are requisite before commercial success or failure is certainly reached.
In a comic strip printed in a 1924 telephone industry journal, a naive character hears that a man has a job as a ""bug hunter"" and gives a gift of a backscratcher.  The man replies ""don't you know that a 'bug hunter' is just a nickname for a repairman?""
Baffle Ball, the first mechanical pinball game, was advertised as being ""free of bugs"" in 1931.
Problems with military gear during World War II were referred to as bugs (or glitches). 
In the 1940 film, Flight Command, a defect in a piece of direction-finding gear is called a bug. 
In a book published in 1942, Louise Dickinson Rich, speaking of a powered ice cutting machine, said, ""Ice sawing was suspended until the creator could be brought in to take the bugs out of his darling.""
Isaac Asimov used the term bug to relate to issues with a robot in his short story ""Catch That Rabbit"", published in 1944.

Computer pioneer and rear admiral, Grace Hopper, popularized a story about a moth that caused a problem in an early electromechanical computer. While Hopper was working on the Mark II and Mark III as Harvard faculty in about 1947, operators traced an error in the Mark II to a moth trapped in a relay. The moth was removed from the mechanism and taped in a log book with the note ""First actual case of bug being found.""

Reportedly, the operators, including William ""Bill"" Burke, later of the Naval Weapons Laboratory, Dahlgren, Virginia,  were familiar with the engineering term and probably making a joke by conflating the two meanings of bug (biological and defect).
Although probably a joke, the story indicates that the term was commonly used in the computer field at that time. 

The log book, complete with moth, is part of the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
The related term debug also appears to predate its usage in computing: the Oxford English Dictionary's etymology of the word contains an attestation from 1945, in the context of aircraft engines.


== ""It's not a bug, it's a feature"" ==
Since bug implies undesirable behavior, calling a behavior a bug is subjective. Behavior which is considered a bug by some may be considered a useful feature by others,
hence a common phrase is ""It's not a bug, it's a feature"" (INABIAF). This quip is recorded in The Jargon File dating to 1975 but dates to 1971 when PDP-8 programmer Sandra Lee Harris at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) made the distinction between issues to be fixed in the code for DEC's FOCAL interpreter and those to be documented or clarified in the user manual.
Such behavior might be explicitly communicated to users, or might remain an undocumented feature.

Hot foot,"The hot foot is a prank where the prankster sets the victim's shoe laces or shoe on fire with a match or lighter.  
There are several other versions of the hot foot prank, but all involve using a source of flame near a victim's foot.  Other versions of the prank involve using a cigarette on the victim's heel, placing a lit match between two bare toes on the victim, or sticking a book of matches to the victim's shoe with gum and lighting the matches.  
The hot foot prank is mentioned in several baseball stories as a prank that players play on one another. Bert Blyleven earned the nickname ""Frying Dutchman"" because of his love of this prank; during Blyleven's time with the Angels, the fire extinguisher in the Angel Stadium clubhouse featured a sign that said ""In case of Blyleven: Pull.""  
Former relief pitcher and pitching coach Roger McDowell was also known for the prank. During his time with the New York Mets, he was featured in a segment of the team's 1986 World Series championship video in which he and teammate Howard Johnson demonstrate how to do it.

Driftwood,"Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto a shore or beach of a sea, lake, or river by the action of winds, tides or waves. It is part of beach wrack.
In some waterfront areas, driftwood is a major nuisance. However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean. Gribbles, shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes.
Most driftwood is the remains of trees, in whole or part, that have been washed into the ocean, due to flooding, high winds, or other natural occurrences, or as the result of logging.  There is also a subset of driftwood known as drift lumber. Drift lumber includes the remains of man-made wooden objects, such as buildings and their contents washed into the sea during storms, wooden objects discarded into the water from shore, dropped dunnage or lost cargo from ships (jetsam), and the remains of shipwrecked wooden ships and boats (flotsam).  Erosion and wave action may make it difficult or impossible to determine the origin of a particular piece of driftwood.
Driftwood can be used as part of decorative furniture or other art forms, and is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks.


== History ==
According to Norse mythology, the first humans, Ask and Embla, were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an ash and an elm, by the god Odin and his brothers, Vili and Vé. The Vikings would cast wood into the sea before making landfall. The location of the wood would be an indication as to where to build their mead halls. The wood used would found the high-seat pillars of the new hall.
Driftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree line until they came into regular contact with European traders. Traditional Inuit boats such as the kayak were fashioned from driftwood frames covered in skins. The Inuit classified driftwood into seven different types, each possessing its own unique material and visual properties. Driftwood could be used to make bows if it was straight grained and in reasonably good condition; these were reinforced with sinew cables. The Inuit even made arrows from driftwood; these were often short and fitted with bone or antler foreshafts. Dry scrapings produced by working this material were collected, stored and used for the starting of fires year-round by Inuit. Wood that is burned today in these regions mainly consists of the remains of condemned wooden structures. Driftwood is still used as kindling by some. Woods with resinous qualities, such as cedar, are preferred for their lengthier burning times. 
The ""Old Man of the Lake"" in Crater Lake, Oregon is a full-size tree that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century. Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been well preserved.
Alice Gray, the legendary ""Diana of the Dunes"", who fought to preserve the Indiana Dunes which contain quantities of driftwood named her college ""Driftwood"", and made all her furniture from driftwood.


== Uses ==


=== Firewood ===
The EPA includes driftwood in its list of ""Items You Should Never Burn in Your [Wood-Burning] Appliance,"" because it will ""release toxic chemicals when burned"".
The government of British Columbia also advises against burning driftwood, as dioxins may be released from the reaction of chloride ions with other materials in the smoke.


=== Sculptures ===

Driftwood sculptures are sculptures that are made of driftwood found on beaches or along riverbanks.

At Kullaberg, Sweden, Lars Vilks created Nimis a driftwood artwork in the year 1980.  This sculpture and two others led to the declaration of Ladonia as an independent nation.
Sculptures were created on the Emeryville, California mudflat and marsh area of San Francisco Bay in the late 1960s.
The Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy (sometimes called the ""Green Oscars"") are sculpted out of driftwood.
Artist Deborah Butterfield is known for her sculptures of horses, initially rendered from driftwood before being cast in bronze.
In January the annual Driftwood and Sand festival is held in Hokitika, New Zealand.


=== Forts ===

Driftwood is commonly used to make a temporary shelter on beaches.


== As a habitat ==

Large diameter Sequoia sempervirens logs spent enough time exposed to wave action to round their contours before being driven into the mouth of a narrow ravine by storm surf. Sequoia's high tannin content is resistant to decay, so these logs retain structural strength for decades. Storm flows within Shorttail Gulch are insufficient to move the logs back to sea. This unique habitat at the mouths of small estuaries of the California coast is threatened by the diminished quantity of large redwood logs available in flood waters since the logging of native forests.


== Decline ==
With the advent of industrial logging practices, the global quantity of driftwood has declined. Early accounts indicate that driftwood was once more plentiful. Early photographs of the pacific coast reveal greater amounts of driftwood on the beaches than is present today. Likewise, when traveling in Dixon Entrance in the late 1800s, George A. Dorsey recorded that many beaches were ""piled high with drift, often to a height of sixty feet or more.""  Melting polar ice may also contribute to the decline of Siberian driftwood in the Atlantic as the sea ice enabled driftwood to travel greater distances without becoming waterlogged.

Demon Slayer,"Demon Slayer is a Japanese manga series. It is about a boy named Tanjiro Kamado who tries to become a Demon Slayer after his family was killed and his younger sister, Nezuko, turned into a demon.  Demon Slayer has twenty-three books. Not only Japanese people but also people all over the world are fascinated by the Manga.
A twenty-six episode anime series was made by the company Ufotable. It was played in Japan from April to September 2019. A sequel, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train, was made in October 2020. A second season of the anime series, a sequel to the Mugen Train was made called the ""Entertainment District"" arc from the book. It was played in Japan from October 2021 to February 2022. A third season for the ""Swordsmith Village"" arc  premiered from April to June 2023.


== Details of Demon Slayer ==
“Demon Slayer” is one of a comic book which started to serialize from Weekly Shonen Jump in 2016 on No.11. It was written by Gotouge Koyoharu. The book is completed from 1 to 23. It is a fight story between humans and demons. Demons appear in various places to catch and eat humans. However people who were trained specially confront demons. Even though it is simply a fight story, it is composed of stories that are laughing, moving, powerful.


== Main Characters ==
Tanjiro Kamado decided to embark on a journey because his sister Nezuko Kamado was made to be a demon. Then, he entered an organization which is called “Kisatsutai”. People can attend it over an audition, so there are many strong people in it. Begging with Tanjiro and members who have each “breathing”. Tanjiro has breathing of water, Zenitsu Agatsuma who is synchronous to Tanjiro has breathing of thunder, and Inosuke Hashibira who is also synchronous to Tanjiro. Inosuke is the only known user of breathing of animals and is said to have created the style. In addition, there are 9 of the strongest slayers who are called “Hashira”. On the other hand, there is the worst and strongest demon which is called Muzan Kibutsuji.


== Progress ==
Demon Slayer started from a comic book, and it expanded various things. Anime started in 2019, and the movie started in 2020 as the “Mugen train” version. In addition, a smartphone app started in 2020, and a home video game is going to start in 2021. Furthermore, there is a stage of the orchestra which performs with pictures of the story of Demon Slayer. In the summer of 2021, the stage of Demon Slayer is going to be held.


== Achievements ==
The comic book of Demon Slayer became popular since anime started in 2019. So the comic book made 34 times more sales in half of one years. Eventually, the comic book was published 120 million. In addition, the movie sales recorded 32.4 billion on December 28 in 2020, and it was over the sales of Spirited Away which had been the most sales in Japan. On the other hand, Demon Slayer combined with Kurazushi and Gindako, and the sales increased by more than 100% year-on-year.


== Trends ==
Movie song of Demon Slayer is “Homura” which was sold December 14 in 2020. Anime song of Demon Slayer is “Gurenge” which was sold July 3 in 2019. Both of them were sung by Japanese singer LiSA. They were the first and second songs that were sung in Karaoke of DAM in 2020. In addition, “Demon Slayer” was nominated for the Bussword Award in 2020.


== Writer ==
The name of the mangaka (Manga artist) is Koyoharu Gotouge. An interview with the person concerned said the writer is female. She is from Fukuoka in Japan and was born in 1989. She has never been seen publicly, and her true identity is unknown. She started her work as a cartoonist in 2013. Demon Slayer is her fifth product. She is also called ""crocodile teacher(In Japanese;Wani Sensei)"" because of her self-portrait of a crocodile which wears glasses.

Negative feedback,"Negative feedback is a basic concept of cybernetics; it is the basis of regulation and control. It is important in engineering and physiology. In biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis.
Negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of a system. This has the result that the changes are made less, and the system kept within limits. The classic example is a central heating system which cuts off when a (suitably placed) temperature sensor hits a pre-set mark. The negative feedback part is the thermostat.

Virtually all aspect of living systems involve homeostasis, and disease follows when any of these systems fail. Examples include blood pressure, glucose level, liver functions, and cell division.
Homeostasis  was defined by Claude Bernard and later by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926, 1929 and 1932 as the property of a system, either open or closed, that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable, constant condition. The concept came from that of milieu interieur which was created by Claude Bernard and published in 1865. 
If the overall feedback of the system is negative, then the system will tend to be stable.

Night sky,"Night sky is the sky in the nighttime or in the late twilight. Often, in that time  some astronomical objects appear on the sky that are not present in the daytime. Such astronomical objects as Moon, stars, planets. But you can see them only when the sky is clear, and if you are away from light pollution.

Yaoyorozu no Kami,"Yaoyorozu no Kami (八百万の神, Eight Million Gods) is a term referring to kami in Shinto. The phrase ""eight million gods"" in Shinto religion does not mean that there are exactly 8 million gods. It means there are too many gods to count. At the time infinity was not a known concept  and 8 is a lucky number in Asian culture. It is used in many other phrases such as Yatagarasu.
Sometimes the kami are divided into the Amatsukami, Kunitsukami, and the eight million other kami.
Emperor Sujin famously communed with the eighty myriad deities for help reorganizing the Yamato Kingship in a time of crisis.
This doctrine says that there are countless Kami, including those that control natural phenomena such as the ocean, mountains, and wind, as well as those that are closely related to human life. Ancestors and influential figures who have achieved great things for their communities are also respected as ""Kami."" Many Shinto customs and stories were documented in Kojiki and Nihon shoki, written records from the Nara Period.
All things, including the Gods, humans, and objects, come from Ame-no-Minakanushi, the first and supreme God. Ame-no-Minakanushi is the source of the universe and life, and is considered the principle of life. Life is at the center of both universal and human doctrines because everything originates from this supreme life. The nature of life is to expand itself.
Some of the 8 million kami are tutelary deities, but most kami do not receive any worship.
Shinto believes in multiple gods and acknowledges that Kami are present in everything, such as weather, geography, and landscape. Yaoyorozu no Kami describes the numerous gods that exist in the world. These gods are often depicted as having human-like qualities and forms. They are believed to be protector deities that can bring blessings or harm to humans. They are also called ""guardian gods"" that provide blessings to people, but they can also torture or harass humans. This dual nature of Kami makes them both revered and feared.
The concept that all things are manifestations of the divine in Shinto has resulted in the integration of foreign deities into the religion. As a result, Shinto has incorporated both Buddhist and Confucian elements, over time.
This idea leads to the potential constant discovery of new deities and social changes and progress.

Travel ban,"A travel ban is one of a variety of mobility restrictions imposed by governments. Bans can be universal or selective. The restrictions can be geographic, imposed by either the originating or destination jurisdiction. They can also be based on individual status, such as health or vaccination, or as driving bans during extreme weather events. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments banned entry by residents of some or all other countries. Motivations for travel bans vary in nature with some being economic while others being more so politically motivated.
For example, if New Zealand decides not to allow travel to the country, the government stops issuing travel visas. Without a valid visa, citizens of other countries cannot enter.


== War-related travel bans ==
During a war a country can decide to ban travel to a country or numerous ones even if it is a neutral party in that said conflict. One example is that of the United States in 1939 when it banned travel to any country that was at war with the 1939 Neutrality Act in response to the outbreak of World War II in Europe that year despite being a neutral party at the time. Another example from that decade coming from the United States is that of the 1937 Neutrality Act which banned US citizens from travelling on any ship that was owned by or registered to a country that was at war.
Travel bans relating to wars can also be gender-specific as well with one example being when Ukraine in 2022 banned all males aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A travel ban can also be instituted by a supranational union. One example of this is when the European Union banned air travel to Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine several European countries banned Russians from travelling to their respective countries.


== Bans issued due to foreign relations ==

A country can ban travel to certain countries based on their status of foreign relations and/or if they are viewed with hostility by a said country. During the Cold War the United States banned travel by declaring travel invalid to communist countries starting with Yugoslavia in 1947 before expanding to Hungary (1949), Bulgaria (1950), Czechoslovakia (1951) and Albania, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania along with the Soviet Union in 1952 unless it was ""specifically endorsed"". Countries can also ban travel by certain foreign nationals to specific areas of a said country as done during the Cold War by the United States to nationals of the Soviet Union and vice versa; with the United States restrictions remaining in place from 1955 to 1962. Japan from the end of World War II until 1964 when they hosted the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics banned travelling abroad for pleasure purposes. American restrictions on travel to China ended in 1971 China banned its citizens from travelling abroad and tourists from abroad until after the death of Mao Zedong when the country began to allow limited travel to Hong Kong and Macau starting in 1983.
With the end of the Cold War, travel became more liberalized. Romania would allow its citizens to travel freely to Western countries in January 1990. Albania during the Cold War was one of Eastern Europe's most isolated countries and American tourists were banned from visiting until June 1990 with the exception of if one had family in Albania. Another example of liberalization that happened at close to the same time was seen in South Korea which started to allow all its citizens to travel freely abroad starting in 1989 as previously they wanted to prevent contact with those who believed in communism and to prevent their currency from being weakened. The 1988 Summer Olympics which were held in Seoul are credited in part to this as it helped open up the country to the rest of the world. China has also liberalized its travel since the end of the Cold War.


=== Economic concerns ===
Countries can limit travel not just out of purely diplomatic relations but also out of economic related concerns. In East Asia after World War II, many countries in East Asia limited or banned outbound travel from their own citizens but allowed foreign citizens to visit as a way to bring in foreign money which could help pay for their industrialization.


== Pandemic ==
Due to the spread of COVID-19, many countries restricted international and/or domestic travel.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the United States implemented a travel ban for most of those arriving from member countries of the European Union, United Kingdom, India, Brazil, China and Japan with flights coming to India being banned starting on May 4, 2021, but with the exception of U.S. citizens and those with permanent residency cards. The American travel ban lasted until November 8, 2021. During the COVID-19 pandemic the United States closed the US-Mexico border to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Mexico was one country that did not institute a full border closure during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Australia implemented some of the strictest measures during the COVID-19 pandemic with Australia closing it borders to any non-residents and prohibited Australians from going abroad ""with a few exceptions"". Australia implemented a travel ban on China starting on February 1, 2020, when it was mostly confined to China with Iran (February 29), South Korea (March 5) and Italy (March 10) being later added until international borders were closed entirely on March 20. Australia lifted this ban in November 2021.


== Weather-related bans ==
A travel ban can be instituted during an extreme weather event. Local governments can ban driving in an attempt to clear major roadways, as was the case during the Late December 2022 North American winter storm. In some cases they may be enforced by military police.


== Litigation ==
Many controversies have sprung up about whether governments have the right to do so. In the United States, a lawsuit challenged Executive Order 13769 that banned travel from seven Muslim-majority nations.


== List of travel bans ==


=== Current ===

Diving tourism,"Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism.
Motivations to travel for scuba diving are complex and may vary considerably during the diver's development and experience. Participation can vary from once off to multiple dedicated trips per year over several decades. The popular destinations fall into several groups, including tropical reefs, shipwrecks and cave systems, each frequented by its own group of enthusiasts, with some overlap. Temperate and inland open water reef sites are generally dived by people who live relatively nearby.
The industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, safety and convenience by way of dive charter services and guide services on dives. Customer satisfaction is largely dependent on the quality of services provided, and personal communication has a strong influence on the popularity of specific service providers in a region.
Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers. Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs so that the industry can continue to develop sustainably.
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity, requiring significant capital outlay to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large capital expense, with high running costs. There are also health and safety aspects for the operator and the customer. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money. Economic sustainability is affected by environmental awareness and conservation, service delivery and customer satisfaction, and sustainable business management. Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, declarations of medical fitness to dive, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.


== History ==

The history of scuba diving tourism is linked to the history of scuba equipment development and availability, and to the development of training systems that opened up the activity to sufficient numbers to support the industry. Key equipment developments include swimfins, which give the diver underwater mobility and free the hands for other functions, the diving mask, which provides underwater vision, the open circuit regulator, a simple and reliable breathing gas source, the buoyancy compensator, which allows the diver to swim comfortably above the bottom, and float at the surface, wetsuit, a simple and easy to use protection from moderately cold water, submersible pressure gauge, allowing easy monitoring of remaining breathing gas, dive computers,  and nitrox breathing gas, both of which allowed longer dives without decompression.
The growth of the diving industry in a region tends to follow a logistic curve, with a slow start and mostly established, experienced divers with relatively high skill levels exploring a new area where there is little supporting infrastructure. As the area becomes popular, the infrastructure develops and the growth accelerates until it is limited by carrying capacity is approached. By this time the main diver demography has shifted towards the inexperienced and often uncertified diver, with low skill levels and a greater tendency to damage the environment  due to ignorance and lack of basic diving skills. Beyond this stage the situation may stabilise if managed well, or if not, the deterioration in value to the tourist may cause a reduction in popularity and a loss of trade.
Too much competition for customers amongst a large number of diving service providers in a region can lead to low profit margins and pressure on struggling companies to cut costs by following unsustainable diving practices and providing substandard equipment. A reduction in numbers may lead to more cooperation between the remaining companies, and a greater willingness to follow sustainable practices.
The shape of the curve will vary depending on the region.  Areas with more resilient ecologies may see larger numbers while remaining viable, while areas with sensitive ecologies may suffer early collapse. Climate change is likely to render many areas more sensitive to diver impact and most will probably have a reduction in carrying capacity based on limits of acceptable change. The sites that remain viable for longer may receive the overflow from sites which suffer ecological collapse, putting them under greater stress as the less competent divers flood areas that were previously less attractive to them.


== Motivation ==

The motivations of scuba divers to travel have been attributed to adventure, learning, escape, social interaction, stature, challenge and excitement, and while these are probably valid for most novice divers and some long term divers, the motivation of long term enthusiasts may be more complex. The development of a recreational diver from novice to experienced diver is usually associated with acquisition and improvement of skills, and is often accompanied by a shift in motivations to dive. Similarly, expectations of the diving experience, satisfaction with the experience available at different dive sites, and attitudes towards the underwater environment will change in divers who continue to dive over the longer term and relatively frequently. The desire to improve and learn for personal growth and the long term satisfaction and fulfilment derived from this learning is common in such divers. This could be an important factor informing the planning and management of diving tourism.


== Destinations ==

Three main classes of recreational diving tourism destinations exist. These are tropical reefs, shipwrecks, and cave systems. Each caters to a different clientele, though there is some overlap. Temperate reefs are less popular as tourist attractions, but can have their own enthusiasts, including short range tourism and incidental dive tourism associated with general tourism in the region. Any exceptional dive site may be visited by expeditionary dive tourists once the attractions are known, though these destinations are generally not serviced by mainstream tourism service providers.


=== Regions where recreational diving is a major tourist industry ===
There are a few regions where international diver tourism is a significant part of the economy They are mostly tropical areas with extensive coral reefs and predictable weather and water conditions, and often have relatively undeveloped industrial economies.

Great Barrier Reef of Australia
The Red Sea
Hurghada is one of the diving destinations on the Red Sea with rich marine biodiversity, good visibility, a variety of dive sites suitable for different skill levels, including historic shipwrecks, and is accessible at all times of the year.
The Caribbean Sea
Indonesia
Thailand
The Coral Triangle of southeast Asia:
The Philippines
Malaysia
Other regions are also popular for diving, but the relative importance of scuba tourism is lower. There are a very large number of dive sites in Europe, and also in parts of the US, reflecting the origins of the activity and a large fraction of the tourists.


=== Tropical coral reefs ===

Tropical coral reefs are popular recreational diving tourism destinations, as they are generally both pleasant and colorful to dive, relatively low in serious hazards, and the water is at a comfortable temperature, so they attract divers of all levels of competence. They are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact.
Regions include:


=== Shipwrecks ===

Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.
Wreck diving may be divided into three categories of differing hazard and skill and certification requirement:

Non-penetration diving (i.e. swimming over the wreck)
Limited penetration diving, within the ""light zone""
Full penetration diving, beyond the ""light zone""
The inherent hazards of wreck diving may be aggravated by local circumstances like depth, layout and condition of the wreck, the silting hazard, and general sea conditions such as visibility, illumination, surge and currents, and water temperature. Training for wreck diving may be marketed as an associated service.


=== Flooded cave systems ===

Cave diving is diving in water-filled caves, which is considered an extreme sport. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, but almost all cave diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave diving and cavern diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified. Cave diving is a specialist aspect of scuba tourism, as the risks are relatively high and the skill requirements are stringent. Cave diving tourism is generally serviced by specialist dive guides and instructors.
Regions include:

The cenotes of the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico.


== Dive resorts ==
A dive resort is a recreational diving service provider which also provides accommodation for clients and their families. They are usually established in places where recreational diving tourism is popular for a large part of the year, particularly if it is a significant part of the local economy.
Dive resorts usually start out small, catering for dive group of about ten divers booked by a single dive shop or agent from a remote area, so the group is often divers who are a social group at their place of origin. This allows the resort to accommodate the needs of that particular group. If the resort becomes popular, it will usually expand and may become the nucleus for development of the area as other service industries form around it.


== Services provided ==
The scuba diving tourism industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, dive charter services and guide services on dives. These organisations are called recreational diving service providers, or dive centres. The standard EN 14467 / ISO 24803 specifies performance requirements for the service provider, and covers aspects of diver training and education, guided dives, and equipment rental, but not the supply of breathing gases, as this is usually covered by national legislation. All of these services are considered distinct.


=== Experiences ===
Retail dive centres provide dive charters, which may be shore or boat dived, dive guides and information on the local environment and ecology, and transportation to and from the dive sites, and may also provide accommodation and hospitality services to tourists, or act as their agents for these services.


==== Liveaboards and day boat dives ====

A liveaboard dive boat is a mobile dive resort. The divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat and provide catering and other hotel services. Amenities may vary from basic to luxurious and the cost will be in proportion. In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber.
The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical diver lift platform. Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat.The tender may also be used to fetch divers separated from the main boat, and for shore excursions where there are no docking facilities.
day boat and basic boat dives may be provided through a land based dive resort, a dive shop, or booked directly with the boar operator. Facilities range from catered with multiple dives to basic transport to and from the site. Much depends on the distance to the site and expected sea and weather conditions.
A day boat would generally provide shelter from the weather and spray while in transit, and be used to transport divers to more than one dive-site during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them. Smaller boats are more usually used when the distance to the dive site is short, and only one dive is intended. Facilities are likely to provide sitting space and a place to sore the scuba set and basic gear. It is common for the diver to travel wearing the diving suit. Since the boat needs only a small amount of space for each diver, it can be smaller and faster than larger boats, or be optimised for surf or slipway launches where there are no convenient harbours. Protection from the weather on fast boats is likely to be the diving suit, sometimes with a windbreaker worn over it, and a hat for the sun, but this will depend on weather conditions.


=== Safety ===

Historically, scuba diving was considered a relatively high risk activity, but this perception has been modified by the developments in equipment, training and service provision. Medical support services and local availability of decompression chambers and on-board medical oxygen for first aid has increased, improving the management of diving accidents and reducing the risk of permanent injury. Recompression facilities for treating serious diving injuries are not often available, even in first world countries.
Prudent service providers will check a client's certification cards and log to ensure the diver has been assessed as competent to dive sites similar to those booked, and may require the diver to demonstrate relevant skills in a checkout dive. Where skills are not of a standard required for safe diving, or environmentally responsible diving, the diver may be requested to take part in remedial training.


=== Equipment ===

The dive tourism industry tends to provide rental equipment to travelling divers more than equipment sales and service, but those aspects are considered valuable adjuncts. Scuba equipment is relatively heavy, and some components (scuba cylinders and diving weights) are not economically transportable by air, and may be included in the cost of a dive. Regulators, wet-suits, masks and fins are more personal equipment, and may be brought by the diver or rented, so a fairly large stock and where applicable, range of sizes is necessary to be able to rent equipment to all customers at a given time. Cameras and dive computers are usually owned by the diver, though entry-level examples may be available for hire at some dive centres. Some equipment manufacturers and distributors encourage exclusive provision of their products through financial incentives, and the range of spares and tools for servicing is affected by the range of equipment stocked, so the range of equipment available may be limited.


=== Diver training ===

There is a large market for diver training while on vacation. Most parts of the world do not have desirable local recreational dive sites, and many divers choose to combine training with a vacation to an area of popular dive sites. Sites suitable for entry-level training often differ considerably from sites which feature as highly desirable for scenic dives and high biodiversity, and unskilled beginners are necessarily kept away from deeper sites with more challenging conditions for their own safety and the protection of the often fragile ecosystems. Specialist wreck diving, cave diving and low environmental impact diving courses are usually available where the local sites are associated with requirements for these certifications.
The Universal Referral Program (URP) is a system intended to facilitate completion of training for open water recreational scuba diving students who intend to do their training dives at a place different from the venue for the theory and confined water training. More specifically, it allows inter agency referral - the referral instructor is not necessarily a member of the same certification agency as the initiating instructor.
Refresher training


=== Specialisation training ===
Training in several specialisations, particularly in technical diving, has become popular as tourism adjuncts because of the venue requiring a specific skill set for access to the sites.

Cave diving
Sidemount diving
Rebreather diving
Deep wreck and wreck penetration diving
Other specialisation training is more optional, as the specific certification is not strictly required, such as boat diving, night diving or drift diving, which are specialties with certification in some agencies' training options, but considered an integral part of core skill certification by others.


== Environmental impact ==

During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Since the 1970s diving has changed from an elite activity to a more accessible recreation, marketed to a very wide demographic. To some extent better equipment has been substituted for more rigorous training, and the reduction in perceived risk has shortened minimum training requirements by several training agencies. Training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences.
Scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide, which has increased to about 23 million by 2016 at about one million per year. Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers.
Diver impact on subtropical, and particularly temperate reefs is less researched than tropical reefs. The perception is that these reefs are less vulnerable than tropical reefs and the sessile species are less vulnerable to diver impact. Diver contact with the bottom is also prevalent on temperate reefs – one of the main forms mentioned is fin contact with the bottom sediment, raising particulate material into the water column and degrading visibility.
Three aspects of responsible diving behaviour have been identified:

Safe diving behaviour, which is largely a matter of competence, use of appropriate equipment for the dive, use of equipment in good working order, staying within the bounds of personal competence and adherence to procedures known to reduce risk.
Good buoyancy control and trim, the ability to remain at a controlled distance from the benthos, and to do so without contacting it. This is a skill often neglected in entry level recreational diver training, but often offered as an extra course, (eg: PADI Peak performance buoyancy), in training systems that have been planned around minimising the duration of individual courses, and where the entry-level training concentrates on providing the minimum skills acceptable for the safety of the diver in the conditions where the training is done. This has convenience advantages to the diver, and financial advantages to the training provider, but as most recreational divers never progress in training beyond entry level, they are often left marginally competent, and may not get enough practice to improve.
Non-contact behaviour, the voluntary avoidance of contact which may damage the environment. This behaviour is only effective if good buoyancy control and trim are available, and it requires situational awareness which may not be sufficiently developed in a novice, particularly in an unfamiliar environment, and using unfamiliar equipment, often exacerbated by the use of a camera, which can distract the diver from detail awareness of their surroundings.
The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types:

The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites,
Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, causing direct physical damage
Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage, which can dislodge loose deposits and accelerate corrosion
Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.


=== Strategies for sustainable use management ===

Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs

Carrying capacity approach. where the number of divers is restricted. This also limits tourism income from the region. Sustainable diver carrying capacity is influenced by factors which vary between sites.
Limits of acceptable change. This model uses quantitative limits on change defined in specific management objectives for a site using an established baseline.
Percentile approach, where capacity is limited by comparison with damage at non-dived control sites
Restricting recreational divers to delimited locations, which usually concentrates divers and damage along diving trails. This creates paths of degraded reef through the more pristine areas, and will cause dissatisfaction as the trail degrades further.
Regulating the type of diving equipment allowed, generally accessories which are thought to increase reef contacts, such as gloves and cameras. These restrictions are understandably unpopular with photographers, and may be applied to both divers who manage to avoid contact and those who do not.
Changing the methods by which the industry provides services. Closer supervision and intervention by dive guides can reduce diver contact rates where the divers are sufficiently skilled to modify their behaviour during the dive. A pre-dive briefing on responsible behaviour, regulations and environmental values can reduce the rate of diver impacts where the divers are sufficiently competent to avoid contact. More effective interventions occur when the number of divers per guide is low.
Encouraging or enforcing competence of divers in low impact diving as a precondition for diving in sensitive areas. This has been identified as an effective way of reducing diver contact.


== Economics ==
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity. Significant capital outlay is required to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large to very large capital expense, and running costs and crew salaries can be considerable. There are also health and safety aspects to be considered, both for the operator and the customer, as high pressure filling equipment is used to provide breathing air which will be used in a hostile environment. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money, and annual registration fees are a required.


=== Sustainability ===
Three factors have been identified as important in economic sustainability:

Environmental awareness and conservation: The regions that are the most popular destinations for most recreational diver tourism are also those with the most fragile and vulnerable ecosystems. Divers have a tendency to choose their destinations based on reputation for a quality experience, which is largely related to the state of the ecosystem. Word gets around when a region's dive sites are deteriorating, and this adversely affects bookings and income. For sustainable business over the long term, the local service providers and communities need to ensure that the impact on the ecology is sustainable. To a large extent this involves ensuring that clients are competent to dive the local sites without damaging delicate organisms, which often requires a level of skill greater than the diver can sustain by diving only a few times a year.
Service delivery and customer satisfaction: Depending  on location, it may be difficult or impossible to consistently provide a satisfactory dive experience, as weather and sea conditions may not be predictable over the longer term. Consequently the type of diving tourism can vary considerably by region, with service providers in some places only able to confirm bookings a few days in advance, while in others a cancellation is the exception, and this may vary seasonally. Customer satisfaction is linked to expectations, and providers catering to a repeat market may be less likely to take the boat out on a day when conditions are forecast to be marginal by local standards.
Sustainable business management. (Return on investment, maintaining reputation, maintaining equipment, compliance with safety requirements etc)


=== Economic risks ===

International risks to the diving tourism industry include terrorism, economic recessions and global disease epidemics. Domestic risks within the borders of specific countries may include increased crime rates, and political instability.
Environmental degradation, partly due to the impact of recreational diving on the environment, where pollution and direct damage by divers have been recorded, and the effects of natural disasters and climate change such as increased water temperature causing coral bleaching are threatening the industry, as divers are less inclined to visit areas where these problems have been reported. Overexploitation by fishing and illegal extraction have led to some sites being closed and permit systems introduced, sometimes limiting the numbers of divers that may visit an area in a given time interval.
The global economic downturn has reduced spending on expensive leisure activities, reducing the income of tourism destinations, including scuba diving charters and diving schools, and political instability deters visitors to a region
Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.
A large proportion of divers visiting tropical coral reef destinations are international travellers – circumstances that may induce them not to travel, or not to visit a particular region can have a strong influence on the viability of a diving operation. A study on diving tourism in East Africa showed that the major environmental risks  for that region are overfishing and marine pollution. The economic risks are mainly price inflation and recessions, the social risks include global disease epidemics and international crime, and political instability and onerous visa regulations are the major political risks.


== Demographics ==

Recreational diving tourists appear to be male-dominated, with an average age in the mid thirties, a college education, and higher than average income, which is in keeping with the relatively high costs of equipment, training and travel.
The general population of American scuba diving participants are on average wealthier and better educated than the general population, and have a higher participation than average in individual and team sports, and extreme sports. Nearly 46% participate in running or jogging, and 36% swim for fitness. The DAN medical emergency line and fatality and injury monitoring program have reported that some divers get injured as a consequence of inadequate physical fitness.
A study to identify differences between local scuba divers and visitors in Florida showed that visitors had less certification and experience but spent more on scuba, compared to local resident divers. Cluster analysis identified four groups of scuba divers:

Fun-seeking belongers: Divers with a strong affiliation for group belonging, looking for fun and excitement, enjoyed diving in varied locations, enjoyed stimulating encounters and considered bonding with other divers important. They self-identified as belonging to the scuba community and sought to associate with other divers with similar attitudes. They tended to have more diving experience and spent more on scuba activities. Mostly males, and the majority unmarried.
Actualizers: Divers focused on challenge, self-recognition, and self-esteem values, likely to consider certification important and consider that overcoming the challenges is important to their self-image. Represented by more females than other groups, and lower income and expenditure on scuba activities.
Inner-circles: People who perceived diving as an opportunity to make new friends, and spend time with family and friends. Image as a diver relatively unimportant, and not driven to be part of the scuba diving community. Mostly married, male, well-educated, with less diving experience than average.
Moderates: Divers more likely to do a single dive in a day, and less focused on the characteristics typical of the other groups.


== Legal risk and liability ==
Participation in recreational diving implies acceptance of the inherent risks of the activity. Diver training includes training in procedures known to reduce these risks to a level considered acceptable by the certification agency, and issue of certification implies that the agency accepts that the instructor has assessed the diver to be sufficiently competent in these skills at the time of assessment and to be sufficiently informed to accept the asso",1
Souvenir,"A souvenir (French for 'a remembrance or memory'), memento, keepsake, or token of remembrance is an object a person acquires for the memories the owner associates with it. A souvenir can be any object that can be collected or purchased and transported home by the traveler as a memento of a visit. The object itself may have intrinsic value, or be a symbol of experience. Without the owner's input, the symbolic meaning is lost and cannot be articulated.


== As objects ==

The tourism industry designates tourism souvenirs as commemorative merchandise associated with a location, often including geographic information and usually produced in a manner that promotes souvenir collecting.
Throughout the world, the souvenir trade is an important part of the tourism industry serving a dual role, first to help improve the local economy, and second to allow visitors to take with them a memento of their visit, ultimately to encourage an opportunity for a return visit, or to promote the locale to other tourists as a form of word-of-mouth marketing. Promotional tchotchke at trade shows serve a similar function. Perhaps the most collected souvenirs by tourists are self-generated: photographs as a medium to document specific events and places for remembrance.
Souvenirs as objects include mass-produced merchandise such as clothing: T-shirts and hats; collectables: postcards, refrigerator magnets, key chains, pins, souvenir coins and tokens, miniature bells, models, figurines, statues; household items: spoons, mugs, bowls, plates, ashtrays, egg timers, fudge, notepads, coasters, and many others.
Souvenirs also include non-mass-produced items such as folk art, local artisan handicrafts, objects that represent the traditions and culture of the area, non-commercial, natural objects such as sand from a beach, and anything else that a person attaches nostalgic value to and collects among their personal belongings. The collecting of natural items such as seashells, plants, or rocks is often discouraged due to ecological damage. Especially the export of endangered plants and animals (or products made of their fur or leather) as souvenirs is strictly regulated by international laws.
A more grisly form of souvenir (here as an example of war booty) in the First World War was displayed by a Pathan soldier to an English Territorial. After carefully studying the Tommy's acquisitions (a fragment of shell, a spike and badge from a German helmet), he produced a cord with the ears of enemy soldiers he claimed to have killed. He was keeping them to take back to India for his wife.


== As memorabilia ==

Similar to souvenirs, memorabilia (Latin for 'memorable (things)'; plural of memorābile) are objects treasured for their memories or historical interest; however, unlike souvenirs, memorabilia can be valued for a connection to an event or a particular professional field, company or brand. Memorabilia can also be related to collections, such as action figures, or video games.
Examples include sporting events, historical events, culture, and entertainment. Such items include: clothing; game equipment; publicity photographs and posters; magic memorabilia; other entertainment-related merchandise & memorabilia; movie memorabilia; airline and other transportation-related memorabilia; and pins, among others.
Often memorabilia items are kept in protective covers or display cases to safeguard and preserve their condition.


== As gifts ==

In Japan, souvenirs are known as omiyage (お土産), and are frequently selected from meibutsu, or products associated with a particular region. Bringing back omiyage from trips to co-workers and families is a social obligation and can be considered a form of apology for the traveller's absence. Omiyage sales are big business at Japanese tourist sites. Unlike souvenirs, however, omiyage are frequently special food products, packaged into several small portions to be easily distributed to all the members of a family or a workplace.
Travelers may buy souvenirs as gifts for those who did not make the trip. A common tradition is to bring a thank-you gift for someone who provided a service such as pet sitting during the trip.
In the Philippines a similar tradition of bringing souvenirs as a gift to family members, friends, and coworkers is called pasalubong.

Bosnian maple,"Bosnian maple is a type of Acer platanoides, a European mountain maple indigenous to former Yugoslavia. It was a very high grade of maple, very light and very strong, according to some the best wood in the world for making violins, as it had the finest resonance. The classic Italian violin makers probably used wood from Tyrol, or northern Yugoslavia, or Switzerland. The maple has mostly been used for the back plates. It was used by the Gagliano family of luthiers.  Portuguese violin maker António Capela uses the Yugoslavian spruce and maple.

Vereniging voor Vreemdelingenverkeer,"The Vereniging voor Vreemdelingenverkeer  (normally just referred to as the VVV) is an organization in the Netherlands in which local or regional leisure companies and organizations work together to promote tourism.  The tourist offices provide visitors with information about the local city or region and assist in the reservation of overnight stays and the booking of activities. In addition, they try to further develop tourism.  Vereniging voor Vreemdelingenverkeer roughly translates as the Association for Tourist Traffic.
The VVV’s income comes from the sale of items such as maps, guides, gift cards and souvenirs. In addition, the participating leisure companies and the municipalities represented, contribute financially to the tourist information activities.
In the Netherlands, individual VVVs are coordinated by VVV Nederland, which functions as a licenser of the VVV brand.  In 2017, the Kennisnetwerk Destinatie Nederland was founded, this is a network of 80 Destination and City Marketing organizations.

Algum,"Algum (Hebrew: אַלְגּוּמִּים, romanized: ’algūmmīm) or almug (Hebrew: אַלְמֻגִּים, romanized: ’almuggīm) is a type of wood referred to in the Hebrew Bible.


== Biblical reference ==
According to the First Book of Kings (1 Kings 10:12), and the Second Book of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 2:8; 9:10–11), it was used, together with cedar and pine, in the construction of the pillars of Solomon's Temple and the crafting of musical instruments for use in the temple. Some English translations say that it was used for the steps rather than the pillars and biblical commentators Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch suggest that ""we should have to think of steps with bannisters"" to make sense of the text.
It is likely that the wood was brought by the ships of Tarshish, sent from the Red Sea port of Ezion-Giber, from the distant country of Ophir, and was very valuable.


== Botanical classification ==
The botanical identity of algum is not known for certain, though some references suggest it may be juniper (Juniperus). Several species of juniper occur in the Middle East region, including Juniperus excelsa (Greek juniper), Juniperus foetidissima (stinking juniper), Juniperus phoenicea (Phoenician juniper), and Juniperus drupacea (Syrian juniper). It is likely that the woods of these species, which are all very similar in woodworking properties, would not have been distinguished from each other in the wood trade. The difficulty in identifying this wood is due in part to uncertainty over the location of the biblical city of Ophir. If Ophir is located in the Philippines, as some think, the wood likely would be red sandalwood or Pterocarpus santalinus.

Bilinga (wood),"Bilinga (also called Aloma in Germany and Opepe in England) is an African wood, from Nauclea diderrichii trees in the family Rubiaceae.
The wood, which grows across tropical Africa from Sierra Leone to Uganda, has about the same density as true hickory, but is not quite as strong.
The wood is extremely heavy.
Log diameter is from 60 to 90 centimetres (24 to 35 in).
The heartwood is golden yellow to orange yellow, and slightly shimmering.
The sapwood has an interlocking grain.
In temperate climates, the wood is very durable against fungi, and durable against dry wood borers and termites. 
It is suitable for use in a marine environment.
Bilinga may be used for railway sleepers, poles, hydraulic works, bridges and ship planking and flooring. It may also be used for heavy industrial flooring. The wood may also be used for veneer and cabinet work.

Failure rate,"Failure rate is the frequency with which an engineered system or component fails. Usually it is expressed in a number of failures per time period, like failures per hour. It is often written as the Greek letter λ (lambda) and is important in reliability theory. In practice, the closely related Mean Time Between Failures is more commonly expressed and used for high quality components or systems.
Failure rate usually increases with time. For example, a car failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than in the first year of service. Nobody expects to replace an exhaust pipe or worn brake pads in a new car.
Mean Time Between Failures is closely related to failure rate.  If the likelihood of failure is constant with respect to time (for example, in some product like a brick or protected steel beam), and ignoring the time to recover from failure, failure rate is simply the inverse of the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).  MTBF is an important specification parameter in all aspects of high importance engineering design–such as naval architecture, aerospace engineering, automotive design, etc.–in short, any task where failure in a key part or of the whole of a system needs be minimized and stopped, particularly where lives might be lost if such factors are not taken into account. These factors account for many safety and maintenance practices in engineering and  industry practices and government regulations, such as how often inspections and overhauls are required on an aircraft.
A similar ratio used in the transport industries, especially in railways and trucking is 'Mean Distance Between Failure', a variation which attempts to correlate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.
Failure rates are important factors in insurance, business, and regulation practices as well as fundamental to design of safe systems throughout a national or international economy.",0
CAD/CAM,"The term CAD/CAM is a shortening of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacture (CAM). The term CAD/NC (Numerical Control) is equivalent in some industries. Most CAD/CAM software was developed for product development and to design and manufacture of components and molds. They are also increasingly used by architects.  CAD/CAM software uses CAD drawing tools to describe geometries used by the CAM portion of the program to define a toolpath that will direct the motion of a machine tool to machine the exact shape that was drawn.

Examples of CAD/CAM software are SolidWorks, INVENTOR, CATiA  and AutoCAD. Furthermore, examples of CAM software are SolidCAM and CAMWorks.
3D CAD/CAM software provides the ability to control CNC machinery from 2.5 axis, 3 axis and multi axis CNC machines. 
Expert CAD/CAM systems were developed around 1988.

Anigre,"Anigre is an African hardwood commonly used for plywood, interior furniture, cabinetry, and high-end millwork applications. It is frequently sliced and sold as veneer, although it is available in board form as well. In board form it is used for boat building, general carpentry, and other light construction uses.


== Characteristics ==
It is considered a tropical hardwood with a clear, cylindrical bole to 80 feet (24 m). It can grow to heights of 180 feet (55 m) with typical trunk diameters ranging from 36 to 48 inches (910 to 1,220 mm). Anigre has a medium texture with closed pores similar to maple. Growth rings aren't always well-defined, and the wood can be rather plain-looking; though certain figure is occasionally present, such as curly or mottled grain. The sapwood and the heartwood are not usually distinguishable.  The heartwood is a light yellowish-brown, sometimes with a pinkish hue. Color tends to darken with age. The quarter figured veneer has become a popular choice for furniture, cabinetry, and decorative architectural applications. It is said to have a faint odor similar to Cedar. In its untreated form Anigre is susceptible to termite and fungi attacks and generally has low durability. Anigre is usually considered easy to work with hand and power tools, although depending on the origin of the wood it can have a high silica content which can dull wood working tools quickly.


== Origins ==
Anigre is often found in tropical East and West Africa, primarily in Cameroon but also in Angola, Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zaire. Exportation from Cameroon is prohibited by local laws.


== Common names ==
Anigre, Aningre, Anegre, Aniegre, Aniegré, Aningré, Aningeria, Aninguerie, Mugangu, Muna, Osan, Anegre Blanc, Longhi, Mukaly, Tanganyika Nuss. Common pronunciations vary from Ah-Nee-Grey, Ah-Nee-Gra, Anna-Gra, Anna-Grey, Uh-Nee-Grey.


== Scientific names ==
Anigre hardwood comes from several species in the family Sapotaceae, including Aningeria altissima,  Aningeria pierrei (synonym Aningeria robusta), Aningeria superba, and Gambeya gigantea (synonym Gambeyobotrys gigantea).

Traveler's cheque,"A traveler's cheque (also traveller's cheque, travellers cheque, traveller's check or traveler's check) is a preprinted  cheque for a fixed amount.  The person who buys it must sign it and then sign it again when he ""cashes"" it.  It is a good way for a traveller to take money when going on holiday.  If a traveler's cheque is stolen it can be replaced so long as the person still has a receipt to prove that he bought it.
Traveler's cheques were a large part of the business of American Express.  Since 2005 the American Express have been issuing ""American Express Travelers Cheque Cards"".  These can be used in stores like a credit card.

Software,"Software consists of computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer. Software can be defined broadly to include design documents, specifications, and testing suites.
The history of software is closely tied to the development of digital computers in the mid-20th century. Early programs were written in the machine language specific to the hardware. The introduction of high-level programming languages in 1958 allowed for more human-readable instructions, making software development easier and more portable across different computer architectures. Software in a programming language is run through a compiler or interpreter to execute on the architecture's hardware. Over time, software has become complex, owing to developments in networking, operating systems, and databases.
Software can generally be categorized into two main types:

operating systems, which manage hardware resources and provide services for applications
application software, which performs specific tasks for users
The rise of cloud computing has introduced the new software delivery model Software as a Service (SaaS). In SaaS, applications are hosted by a provider and accessed over the Internet.
The process of developing software involves several stages. The stages include software design, programming, testing, release, and maintenance. Software quality assurance and security are critical aspects of software development, as bugs and security vulnerabilities can lead to system failures and security breaches. Additionally, legal issues such as software licenses and intellectual property rights play a significant role in the distribution of software products.


== History ==

The first use of the word software is credited to mathematician John Wilder Tukey in 1958.
The first programmable computers, which appeared at the end of the 1940s, were programmed in machine language. Machine language is difficult to debug and not portable across different computers. Initially, hardware resources were more expensive than human resources. As programs became complex, programmer productivity became the bottleneck. The introduction of high-level programming languages in 1958 hid the details of the hardware and expressed the underlying algorithms into the code . Early languages include Fortran, Lisp, and COBOL.


== Types ==

There are two main types of software:

Operating systems are ""the layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and their applications"". There are three main purposes that an operating system fulfills:
Allocating resources between different applications, deciding when they will receive central processing unit (CPU) time or space in memory.
Providing an interface that abstracts the details of accessing hardware details (like physical memory) to make things easier for programmers.
Offering common services, such as an interface for accessing network and disk devices. This enables an application to be run on different hardware without needing to be rewritten.
Application software runs on top of the operating system and uses the computer's resources to perform a task. There are many different types of application software because the range of tasks that can be performed with modern computers is so large. Applications account for most software and require the environment provided by an operating system, and often other applications, in order to function.

Software can also be categorized by how it is deployed. Traditional applications are purchased with a perpetual license for a specific version of the software, downloaded, and run on hardware belonging to the purchaser.  The rise of the Internet and cloud computing enabled a new model, software as a service (SaaS), in which the provider hosts the software (usually built on top of rented infrastructure or platforms) and provides the use of the software to customers, often in exchange for a subscription fee. By 2023, SaaS products—which are usually delivered via a web application—had become the primary method that companies deliver applications.


== Software development and maintenance ==

Software companies aim to deliver a high-quality product on time and under budget. A challenge is that software development effort estimation is often inaccurate. Software development begins by conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, and making a software design. Most software projects speed up their development by reusing or incorporating existing software, either in the form of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or open-source software. Software quality assurance is typically a combination of manual code review by other engineers and automated software testing. Due to time constraints, testing cannot cover all aspects of the software's intended functionality, so developers often focus on the most critical functionality. Formal methods are used in some safety-critical systems to prove the correctness of code, while user acceptance testing helps to ensure that the product meets customer expectations. There are a variety of software development methodologies, which vary from completing all steps in order to concurrent and iterative models. Software development is driven by requirements taken from prospective users, as opposed to maintenance, which is driven by events such as a change request.
Frequently, software is released in an incomplete state when the development team runs out of time or funding. Despite testing and quality assurance, virtually all software contains bugs where the system does not work as intended. Post-release software maintenance is necessary to remediate these bugs when they are found and keep the software working as the environment changes over time. New features are often added after the release. Over time, the level of maintenance becomes increasingly restricted before being cut off entirely when the product is withdrawn from the market. As software ages, it becomes known as legacy software and can remain in use for decades, even if there is no one left who knows how to fix it. Over the lifetime of the product, software maintenance is estimated to comprise 75 percent or more of the total development cost.
Completing a software project involves various forms of expertise, not just in software programmers but also testing, documentation writing, project management, graphic design, user experience, user support, marketing, and fundraising.


== Quality and security ==

Software quality is defined as meeting the stated requirements as well as customer expectations. Quality is an overarching term that can refer to a code's correct and efficient behavior, its reusability and portability, or the ease of modification. It is usually more cost-effective to build quality into the product from the beginning rather than try to add it later in the development process. Higher quality code will reduce lifetime cost to both suppliers and customers as it is more reliable and easier to maintain. Software failures in safety-critical systems can be very serious including death. By some estimates, the cost of poor quality software can be as high as 20 to 40 percent of sales.  Despite developers' goal of delivering a product that works entirely as intended, virtually all software contains bugs.
The rise of the Internet also greatly increased the need for computer security as it enabled malicious actors to conduct cyberattacks remotely. If a bug creates a security risk, it is called a vulnerability.  Software patches are often released to fix identified vulnerabilities, but those that remain unknown (zero days) as well as those that have not been patched are still liable for exploitation. Vulnerabilities vary in their ability to be exploited by malicious actors, and the actual risk is dependent on the nature of the vulnerability as well as the value of the surrounding system.  Although some vulnerabilities can only be used for denial of service attacks that compromise a system's availability, others allow the attacker to inject and run their own code (called malware), without the user being aware of it. To thwart cyberattacks, all software in the system must be designed to withstand and recover from external attack. Despite efforts to ensure security, a significant fraction of computers are infected with malware.


== Encoding and execution ==


=== Programming languages ===

Programming languages are the format in which software is written. Since the 1950s, thousands of different programming languages have been invented; some have been in use for decades, while others have fallen into disuse. Some definitions classify machine code—the exact instructions directly implemented by the hardware—and assembly language—a more human-readable alternative to machine code whose statements can be translated one-to-one into machine code—as programming languages. Programs written in the high-level programming languages used to create software share a few main characteristics: knowledge of machine code is not necessary to write them, they can be ported to other computer systems, and they are more concise and human-readable than machine code. They must be both human-readable and capable of being translated into unambiguous instructions for computer hardware.


=== Compilation,  interpretation, and execution ===
The invention of high-level programming languages was simultaneous with the compilers needed to translate them automatically into machine code. Most programs do not contain all the resources needed to run them and rely on external libraries. Part of the compiler's function is to link these files in such a way that the program can be executed by the hardware. Once compiled, the program can be saved as an object file and the loader (part of the operating system) can take this saved file and execute it as a process on the computer hardware. Some programming languages use an interpreter instead of a compiler. An interpreter converts the program into machine code at run time, which makes them 10 to 100 times slower than compiled programming languages.


== Legal issues ==


=== Liability ===

Software is often released with the knowledge that it is incomplete or contains bugs. Purchasers knowingly buy it in this state, which has led to a legal regime where liability for software products is significantly curtailed compared to other products.


=== Licenses ===

Source code is protected by copyright law that vests the owner with the exclusive right to copy the code. The underlying ideas or algorithms are not protected by copyright law, but are often treated as a trade secret and concealed by such methods as non-disclosure agreements. Software copyright has been recognized since the mid-1970s and is vested in the company that makes the software, not the employees or contractors who wrote it. The use of most software is governed by an agreement (software license) between the copyright holder and the user. Proprietary software is usually sold under a restrictive license that limits copying and reuse (often enforced with tools such as digital rights management (DRM)). Open-source licenses, in contrast, allow free use and redistribution of software with few conditions. Most open-source licenses used for software require that modifications be released under the same license, which can create complications when open-source software is reused in proprietary projects.


=== Patents ===

Patents give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a novel product or process. Ideas about what software could accomplish are not protected by law and concrete implementations are instead covered by copyright law. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid. Software patents have been historically controversial. Before the 1998 case State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., software patents were generally not recognized in the United States. In that case, the Supreme Court decided that business processes could be patented. Patent applications are complex and costly, and lawsuits involving patents can drive up the cost of products. Unlike copyrights, patents generally only apply in the jurisdiction where they were issued.


== Impact ==

Engineer Capers Jones writes that ""computers and software are making profound changes to every aspect of human life: education, work, warfare, entertainment, medicine, law, and everything else"". It has become ubiquitous in everyday life in developed countries. In many cases, software augments the functionality of existing technologies such as household appliances and elevators. Software also spawned entirely new technologies such as the Internet, video games, mobile phones, and GPS. New methods of communication, including email, forums, blogs, microblogging, wikis, and social media, were enabled by the Internet. Massive amounts of knowledge exceeding any paper-based library are now available with a quick web search. Most creative professionals have switched to software-based tools such as computer-aided design, 3D  modeling, digital image editing, and computer animation. Almost every complex device is controlled by software.

Straight ahead animation,"Straight ahead is a term used in animation that refers to a method that uses only the first key pose of a character, and then continues drawing the character to create the desired motion. It was first referred to in the 1981 book by Ollie Johnson and Frank Thomas The Illusion of Life, and is a part of the 12 Basic Principles of Animation. It contrasts with its converse, pose to pose animation, in that it does not use inbetweening. Straight ahead action is so named because the animator literally works straight ahead from the first drawing of the scene.  Disney director-animator Woolie Reitherman said, ""When I didn't know what I was doing in an action, I always went straight-ahead. I'd just start on ones. Half the time I didn't know what I was doing. To me, it's fun. You find out something you wouldn't have found out otherwise.""


== Advantages and risks ==
Straight ahead animation is mostly used for wild, scrambling actions where spontaneity is important. Because the animator has no real guide to the target destination in the action, a character's form may start to shrink or grow, and the animator will have no idea it happened until after they are done. Although this technique is a lot more spontaneous and creative, it can create inaccurate results.


=== Advantages ===
The animator gets a natural flow of fluid, spontaneous action.
It has the vitality of improvisation
It's very 'creative', the animator goes with the flow, creating all of the action as it comes along
Often the unconscious mind starts to kick in: like when authors say that their character speaks to them and tells them where it's going.
It can produce surprises; what animators call ""Magic"".


=== Risks ===
Things start to wander.
Time stretches and the shot gets longer and longer.
Characters grow and shrink.
The animator can miss the point of a shot and not arrive at the right place at the right time.
The director can't see what's happening in the shot, and it's very difficult for more than one animator to work on the scene.
The best way for an animator to make use of the Straight ahead action, is to use it to animate things that have very erratic and unpredictable movement patterns. Fire, water, and fog are some examples of movement that are better animated with the use of the Straight ahead animation technique.

Web application,"A web application is a software application that can be run without being installed on the client and that has several parts: A part of it will run on the remote web server, another part will run on the client, usually inside a web browser. Both parts communicate over a computer network, for example the internet. The protocol they often use is  called HTTP. This kind of application design is called client-server model. A Web application can be advantageous because the use of browsers allows the application to be compatible with most standard computers and operating systems whilst it does not take up memory on a computer’s hard dive and is accessible from nearly any computer or device a person might use.The parts are usually called ""tiers"". The most common kind is a three-tier application: One tier is called Presentation tier, another is called Application tier, and the third is called Storage tier. Common examples of web applications are those used for web mail, or for online banking. Social media sites, such as Wikipedia are also web applications.

=== Drawbacks ===
Because they run inside a web browser, most web applications ""look"" very different to regular programs. The user experience or ease of use is different and some may dislike it.
Web applications need to be coded so they follow standards. Any browser that also follows the standard can be used. Small changes in a given browser's implementation of a standard may prevent that browser from using the web application.
Web applications need a connection to the server where the application runs, all the time. The connection may need a certain bandwidth. Without an adequate connection, the application may not be usable; in the worst case, data may be lost.
Many applications are dependent on the server that hosts them. When the server is switched off, or the company goes bust, the application is no longer usable. Traditional applications continue to work.
The company offering the web application has complete control over it. This also means that they may launch a new version when they want to; the option to ""skip"" a less popular version does not exist.
In many cases, the data is stored remotely too. It may not be possible to export the data so that it can be used with another application.
The company can theoretically track anything the users do. This can cause privacy problems.

Draped painting,"Draped paintings are paintings on unstretched canvas or fabric that are hung, tied, or draped from individual points and allowed to bunch or fold. The style was developed in the late 1960s and 1970s by several groups of artists, and popularized most notably by American artist Sam Gilliam, who created a large number of Drape paintings throughout his career, often as large-format installation pieces designed to fill an entire wall or space.


== Historical origins ==
In the late 1960s, the idea of shaped canvases in the context of contemporary art was expanding to include three-dimensional shapes and sculptural, painted reliefs. Several groups of artists working in different regions began extending this concept by experimenting with paintings without stretcher bars or made with everyday fabrics and objects, or presenting the stretcher bars themselves as art.
Working in New York, Richard Tuttle began to pin colored and painted irregular geometric fabric shapes to the wall in 1967. Artists associated with the Supports/Surfaces movement in France, beginning the same year, started hanging large painted fabrics on the wall, often combining multiple pieces of fabric together. Sam Gilliam in Washington, D.C., Claude Viallat in France, and Nina Yankowitz in New York - among possibly others - concurrently and without knowledge of each other began knotting and folding their wet canvases or painted fabrics to achieve the patterns they wanted in the compositions before draping them in different combinations on the wall, starting in 1967 and 1968. Gilliam in particular rapidly increased the size of his canvases and began to suspend his works out beyond the gallery wall, sometimes tying them from points in the ceiling or middle of the room, bringing the paintings into conversation with the architectural features of the gallery space. 
Sculptors and mixed media artists including Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse, and Robert Morris, all working around the same time in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were also beginning to use suspended and wall-based fabrics and sculptural elements, draped or shaped in similar ways. Some artists in this wave of exploration of material and form would eventually be broadly categorized by several critics and historians as early postminimalist artists, for their use of everyday materials and objects to create a new kind of ""anti-formalist"" art that rejected key aesthetic elements of minimalism and medium specificity, both of which were leading formalist strains of art production and criticism in the 1960s. Critic Robert Pincus-Witten, a leading proponent of postminimalist art, defined this as art whose content or form is an exploration of what art can or should be, but as defined through an artist or critic's own personal ""imperfect world of experience;"" this eventually also led to and encompassed the development of conceptual art.


== Origin of the term ==
In 1968 and 1969 Yankowitz had two exhibitions of draped paintings in New York, using the terms ""Draped Paintings"" and ""Pleated Paintings"" as the titles of the shows. 
Critics first described Gilliam's draped canvas paintings in 1969 variously as ""hanging canvas,"" ""soft"" paintings, and, once they became more elaborate, ""situations;"" Gilliam himself originally used the terms ""suspended paintings"" and ""sculptural paintings"" to describe the style. Several critics and art historians - and Gilliam - came to call his works in this style his Drapes or ""Drape paintings,"" both for the method of draping and for their resemblance to heavy Baroque-style fabric window drapery, which he cited as an inspiration in 1970.


== Gilliam's Drape paintings ==
Gilliam's Drape paintings first began as an extension of an earlier series of abstract paintings displayed on beveled stretcher bars, which extended the paintings several inches off the wall like sculptured reliefs. To create these paintings he would pour and soak thinned acrylic paint onto canvases laid directly on the floor, before folding them to create clear lines and pools of color in the composition. Starting in late 1967, Gilliam experimented with draping these canvases once they had dried; he left them crumpled and folded to dry, and then used rope, leather, wire, and other materials to suspend, drape, or knot the paintings from walls and ceilings of his workshop. He tested a range of fabrics for these paintings, including linens, silks, and cotton materials.
The precise genesis of Gilliam's Drape paintings is unclear, as he offered multiple explanations throughout his life. Among the most-cited origin stories is that he was inspired by laundry hanging on clotheslines in his neighborhood in such volumes that the clotheslines had to be propped up to support the weight, an explanation he told ARTnews in 1973. Alternately, he told  art historian Jonathan P. Binstock in 1994 that he had visited artist Kenneth Noland in Vermont in 1967 and engaged in a significant discussion about the sculpture of Anthony Caro and David Smith: ""What really shocked me is that I had never thought about sculpture at all ... And that's what led to the draped paintings; I mean, trying to produce a work that was about both painting and sculpture."" Further still, he told filmmaker Rohini Tallala in 2004 that the Drape paintings had been inspired by his father's work as a hobbyist carpenter making sets for plays at their church in Louisville. In a 2011 interview with Kojo Nnamdi on WAMU, he directly refuted the widely cited origin story about laundry on clotheslines, telling Nnamdi that the Drapes were ""a business decision,"" made because he ""had to do something different,"" and that they had been inspired by Washington's Rock Creek Park.
Gilliam's first public exhibition of these paintings in late 1968 included works like Swing. The following year, an exhibition at Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art, Gilliam/Krebs/McGowin (with Rockne Krebs and Ed McGowin), presented ten of Gilliam's largest and most immersive Drape works up to that point. These included Baroque Cascade, a 150 ft long canvas suspended from the rafters in the Corcoran's two-story atrium gallery; and Carousel Form II, Carousel Form III, Horizontal Extension, and Light Depth, each 75 ft long and draped from the walls throughout the smaller side galleries. Baroque Cascade in particular received acclaim for combining painting and architecture to explore space, color, and shape.
In the 1970s, he created larger and more immersive Drapes including metal, rocks, wooden beams, ladders, and sawhorses in the environment, sometimes draping or piling canvases over the objects instead of suspending them from above. One of his largest and most well-known works, Seahorses, was a draped installation created for the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of a city-wide festival in 1975. Inspired by the large bronze rings that decorate the top of the museum's building, which Gilliam said had made him imagine Neptune using them to tie seahorses to his temple, the work consisted of six monumental painted canvases, two measuring 40 x 95 ft and four measuring 30 x 60 ft, hung from their respective top corners on the outside walls of the museum, attached via the rings and drooping down in upside-down arches of folds. In 1977 he reinstalled the work with five canvases instead of six, on the outside of the Brooklyn Museum.
Gilliam integrated the natural environment into a Drape work completed in 1977 for an artist residency at the Artpark State Park in upstate New York, where he was assisted in part by his daughter Melissa. His installation Custom Road Slide, his first formal engagement with land art, was created with hundreds of yards of tobacco muslin and polypropylene stained with biodegradable pigment that he installed across the landscape of the park, overlooking the Niagara Gorge. He ran the canvases up and down hills and draped them across different parts of the park in over a dozen individual installations over the course of the summer residency, accompanied by piles of shale, pigmented sawhorses and wood boards, and detritus gathered from the park; Gilliam described the pieces as ""sculptural fabric placements."" The form of the installation took shape after Gilliam and his assistants draped a length of painted muslin over a cliff before a storm blew it down the slope; they then reclaimed the partly destroyed muslin, draping and sculpting it with objects in various areas of the park, often running alongside the park's road.
Also in 1977, as one of the first artists-in-residence at the newly established Fabric Workshop and Museum, he created Philadelphia Soft, six draped linen and canvas works that he had covered with printed designs instead of paint, repeated by hand in layered configurations using the workshop's industrial screenprinter. Critic Grace Glueck called this piece ""as subtle and beautiful as his abstract paintings.""
Gilliam installed a monumental Drape painting at the Whitney Museum's Phillip Morris branch gallery in 1993. The work - Golden Element Inside Gold - comprised a massive canvas draped within several large metal rings hanging from the ceiling in the gallery's large atrium.
In 1997 he created an installation at the Kunstmuseum Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen in Magdeburg, Germany, inside the museum's historic chapel. Combining his earlier immersive Drape installations with his printmaking and sewing techniques, he used woodcut engravings to stamp an over 3000 ft length of polypropylene before staining, painting, and then cutting it into long, thin pieces. He sewed the strips onto a support structure in the chapel's vaulted ceiling, creating dozens of parabola forms that hung nearly to the floor in the nave of the chapel, and installed variously sized mirrors at different angles in the building's archways to reflect the painted forms. He first presented a version of this installation, created in collaboration with printmaker William Weege, in 1991 at the Walker Hill Art Center in Seoul.
In 1998 at Washington's Kreeger Museum he placed several small Drape paintings in the museum's outdoor pool. The director of the museum later recalled that, after she had given Gilliam somewhat negative feedback on a work he was preparing inside a gallery, he decided to throw the canvases in the pool as a different artistic direction, building custom floatation devices to keep them situated through the exhibition. 
Gilliam was commissioned by the Art in Embassies Program in 2006 to create a permanent work for the American Embassy in Bamako, Mali. His Drape work Mali consists of several bright stained canvases draped like hoods over suspension wires in the embassy's atrium, which writer Jackson Brown has compared to Gilliam's earlier Cowl paintings.
In conjunction with The Phillips Collection's 90th anniversary in 2011, Gilliam created a site-specific Drape work commissioned for the large well next to the museum's interior elliptical spiral staircase, nearly 45 years after his debut solo museum show, at The Phillips in 1967. Titled Flour Mill and directly inspired by the American abstract artist Arthur Dove's painting Flour Mill II from 1938, which is owned by the museum, Gilliam's installation comprised a series of narrow, 8–10 ft long nylon panels, each folded in half over a set of wires in multiple rows spanning the width of the well next to the stairs, and hanging down from the second floor to the first. After staining and splashing the nylon with acrylic, Gilliam cut a series of rectangular openings into each panel, creating visual windows or frames that revealed the back half of the panel when folded over the wire. Later that year he staged a solo exhibition at the American University Museum, installing a series of draped canvases from the ceilings in the museum's double-height rotunda gallery, each by a single point in the canvas to form tree-like shapes that either hovered just above the floor or cascaded onto it, creating what the curator described as ""a forest of art."" He also showed several smaller Drape constructions which he created by stitching stained and painted nylon into drooping box-like forms that he hung on the wall.
In 2017 he installed Yves Klein Blue outside the main building for the show Vive Arte Viva at the 57th Vennice Biennale, similar to the presentation of the earlier Seahorses.

Obelisk,"An obelisk (; from Ancient Greek  ὀβελίσκος (obelískos), diminutive of ὀβελός (obelós) 'spit, nail, pointed pillar') is a tall, slender, tapered monument with four sides and a pyramidal or pyramidion top. Originally constructed by Ancient Egyptians and called tekhenu, the Greeks used the Greek term obeliskos to describe them, and this word passed into Latin and ultimately English. Though William Thomas used the term correctly in his Historie of Italie of 1549, by the late sixteenth century (after reduced contact with Italy following the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth), Shakespeare failed to distinguish between pyramids and obelisks in his plays and sonnets. Ancient obelisks are monolithic and consist of a single stone; most modern obelisks are made of several stones.


== Ancient obelisks ==


=== Egyptian ===

Obelisks were prominent in the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, and played a vital role in their religion placing them in pairs at the entrance of the temples. The word ""obelisk"" as used in English today is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the Greek traveler, was one of the first classical writers to describe the objects. A number of ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the ""unfinished obelisk"" found partly hewn from its quarry at Aswan. These obelisks are now dispersed around the world, and fewer than half of them remain in Egypt.
The earliest temple obelisk still in its original position is the 68-foot (20.7 m) 120-metric-ton (130-short-ton) red granite Obelisk of Senusret I of the Twelfth Dynasty at Al-Matariyyah in modern Heliopolis.
In Egyptian mythology, the obelisk symbolized the sun god Ra, and during the religious reformation of Akhenaten it was said to have been a petrified ray of the Aten, the sundisk. Benben was the mound that arose from the primordial waters Nu upon which the creator god Atum settled in the creation story of the Heliopolitan creation myth form of Ancient Egyptian religion. The Benben stone (also known as a pyramidion) is the top stone of the Egyptian pyramid. It is also related to the obelisk.
Both New York University Egyptologist Patricia Blackwell Gary and Astronomy senior editor Richard Talcott hypothesize that the shapes of the ancient Egyptian pyramid and obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god Ra being the Egyptians' greatest deity at that time). The pyramid and obelisk's significance have been previously overlooked, especially the astronomical phenomena connected with sunrise and sunset: Zodiacal light and sun pillars respectively.

==== Nubian ====
Ancient Nubian kings of the twenty-fifth Dynasty sought to legitimize their rule over Egypt by constructing Egyptianizing monuments in the Middle Nile region. Historical sources mention that king Piye built at least one obelisk. The obelisk was made of local black granite and was found at the site of Kadakol. It had been cut down to make it into a column, presumably for one of the early Christian churches in the area of Old Dongola. Today the obelisk is exhibited in the National Museum in Khartoum. The obelisk is inscribed with the kings official titulary: Strong-bull, Appearing-in-Dominion (Thebes), King-of-Upper-and-Lower-Egypt, Two-ladies, Ruler-of-Egypt, Son-of-Rê, Pi(ankh)y: what he made as his monument for his father Amen-Rê, lord of [...].
An obelisk of King Senkamanisken was found at Gebel Barkal in 1916 by the Harvard University Museum of Fine Arts expedition to Sudan. There are remains of another small obelisk inscribed with the cartouche of King Aktisanes at the site of Gebel Barkal.


==== Ancient Egyptian obelisks in Ancient Rome ====

Around 30 BCE, Rome seized control of Egypt and looted the various temple complexes; in one case they destroyed walls at the Temple of Karnak to haul them out. There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.
The largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the Lateran Obelisk in the square at the west side of the Lateran Basilica in Rome at 105.6 feet (32.2 m) tall and a weight of 455 metric tons (502 short tons). More well known is the iconic 25 metres (82 ft), 331-metric-ton (365-short-ton) Vatican obelisk at Saint Peter's Square. Brought to Rome by the Emperor Caligula in 37 CE, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the Circus of Nero, flanking St Peter's Basilica.

The elder Pliny in his Natural History refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at Ostia.
Pope Sixtus V was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. Domenico Fontana, the assistant of Giacomo Della Porta in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V (1590), which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision. Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When Carlo Maderno came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.

Three more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at Santa Maria Maggiore, in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the Piazza del Popolo, in 1589. An obelisk stands in front of the church of Trinità dei Monti, at the head of the Spanish Steps. Other notable Egyptian obelisks in Rome are found in Piazza della Minerva, sculpted while being carried on the back of an elephant, Piazza Montecitorio, Piazza della Rotonda, the Baths of Diocletian, and Villa Celimontana. Rome lost one of its obelisks, the Boboli obelisk which had decorated the temple of Isis, where it was uncovered in the 16th century. The Medici claimed it for the Villa Medici, but in 1790 they moved it to the Boboli Gardens attached to the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, and left a replica in its place.
Not all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome: Herod the Great imitated his Roman patrons and set up an obelisk, Caesarea obelisk, made out of Egyptian red granite in the hippodrome of his new city Caesarea in northern Judea. This one is about 40 feet (12 m) tall and weighs about 100 metric tons (110 short tons). It was discovered by archaeologists and has been re-erected at its former site.
In 357 CE, Emperor Constantius II had two Karnak Temple obelisks removed and transported down the Nile to Alexandria to commemorate his ventennalia, the 20th year of his reign. Afterward, one was sent to Rome and erected on the spina of the Circus Maximus, and is today known as the Lateran Obelisk. The other one, known as the Obelisk of Theodosius, remained in Alexandria until 390 CE, when Emperor Theodosius I had it transported to Constantinople (now Istanbul) and put up on the spina of the Hippodrome of Constantinople (now Sultan Ahmet Square). It once stood 95 feet (29 m) tall and weighed 380 metric tons (420 short tons); however, its lower section (which reputedly also once stood in the hippodrome) is now lost, reducing the obelisk's size to 65 feet (20 m).


==== Ancient Egyptian obelisks in modern cities ====

The Ancient Romans populated their city with 8 large and 42 small Egyptian obelisks. More have been re-erected elsewhere, and the best-known examples outside Rome are the pair of 21-metre (69 ft) 187-metric-ton (206-short-ton) Cleopatra's Needles in London, England (21 metres or 69 feet), and New York City, US (21 metres or 70 feet), and the 23-metre (75 ft) over-250-metric-ton (280-short-ton) Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.
Obelisks were being shipped out of Egypt as late as the nineteenth century when three of them were sent to London, New York and Paris. Their transportation was covered by various newspapers.


=== Assyrian ===
Obelisk monuments are also known from the Assyrian civilization, where they were erected as public monuments that commemorated the achievements of the Assyrian king.
The British Museum possesses four Assyrian obelisks:
The White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I (named due to its colour), was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1853 at Nineveh. The obelisk was erected by either Ashurnasirpal I (1050–1031 BCE) or Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BCE). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.
The Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer Hormuzd Rassam, was found on the citadel of Nimrud (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments. The surviving parts of the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing to the king from Syria and the west.
The Black Obelisk was discovered by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1846 on the citadel of Kalhu. The obelisk was erected by Shalmaneser III and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, Jehu the Israelite, and Sua the Gilzanean, making gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III's annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.
The Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh. Only the top of this monolith has been reconstructed in the British Museum. The obelisk is the oldest recorded obelisk from Assyria, dating to the 11th century BCE.


=== Ancient Roman ===
The Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style. Examples include:

Arles, France – Arles Obelisk, in Place de la République, a 4th-century obelisk of Roman origin
Benevento, Italy – Domitian Obelisk
Munich, Germany – Obelisk of Titus Sextius Africanus, at Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst, 1st century CE, 5.8 metres (19 ft)
Rome – there are five, see List of obelisks in Rome


=== Byzantine ===

Istanbul, Turkey – Walled Obelisk, at Hippodrome of Constantinople (now Sultan Ahmet Square), built by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (905–959) and originally covered with gilded bronze plaques


=== Pre-Columbian ===
The prehistoric Tello Obelisk, found in 1919 at Chavín de Huantar in Peru, is a monolith stele with obelisk-like proportions. It is 2.52 metres tall and was carved in a design of low relief with Chavín symbols, such as bands of teeth and animal heads. Long housed in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú in Lima, it was relocated to the Museo Nacional de Chavín, which opened in July 2008. The obelisk was named for the archeologist Julio C. Tello, who discovered it and was considered the 'father of Peruvian archeology'. He was America's first indigenous archeologist.


== Modern obelisks ==


=== As commemorative monuments ===
Egyptian obelisks remain a source of fascination, serving as a reminder of past glories and a symbol of state power. A majority of modern obelisks are built of masonry or concrete, so not monolithic like their Egyptian counterparts, and are often oversized. Examples from the 19th and 20th centuries include the Obelisk (1800) in Stockholm, Stone of the Empress (1835) in Helsinki, the Wellington Monument (1861) in Dublin, the Washington Monument (1884) in Washington, D.C., the Obelisk of Buenos Aires (1936) in Buenos Aires, the Monument to the People's Heroes (1958) in Tiananmen Square, Beijing and the National Monument (1975) in Jakarta. A few, however, continue the ancient tradition of the monolithic obelisk.

=== Others usages ===
In Rome, the Via della Conciliazione, cleared in 1936–1950 to link Saint Peter's Basilica to the centre of the capital is lined with obelisks serving as lampposts.
In France and other European countries, monuments to the dead, such as headstones and grave markers, were very often given a form of obelisks, but they are of more modest size. The practice is also still widespread in the Islamic world.
Modern obelisks have also been used in surveying as boundary markers.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Transportation and erection experiments ===
In late summer 1999, Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner teamed up with a NOVA crew to erect a 25-ton obelisk. This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a 2-ton obelisk and a 9-ton obelisk. Finally in August–September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully. First Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10–20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way. Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are listed here.
One experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about 3.0 metres (10 ft) long and no more than 5 metric tons (5.5 short tons). A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to 61-metre-long (200 ft) and 30-metre-wide (100 ft). The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.
The final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15° had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.
This experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations. It seems to have been supported by a 3,000 year-old papyrus scroll in which one scribe taunts another to erect a monument for ""thy lord"". The scroll reads ""Empty the space that has been filled with sand beneath the monument of thy Lord."" To erect the obelisks at Luxor with this method would have involved using over a million cubic meters of stone, mud brick and sand for both the ramp and the platform used to lower the obelisk. The largest obelisk successfully erected in ancient times weighed 455 metric tons (502 short tons). A 520-metric-ton (570-short-ton) stele was found in Axum, but researchers believe it was broken while attempting to erect it.

Lumber,"Lumber (or timber) is wood that has been cut for use in building.


== Dimensional lumber ==
Dimensional lumber is a term used in North America for lumber that is finished/planed and cut to standardized width and depth specified in inches.


=== Softwoods ===

Examples of common sizes are 2×4 (also two-by-four and other variants), 2×6, and 4×4.  The length of a board is usually specified separately from the width and depth. It is thus possible to find 2×4s that are four, eight, or twelve feet in length. In the United States the standard lengths of lumber are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 feet.


=== Non-North American sizes ===

Outside North America sizes of timber vary slightly. Sizes are, in some cases, based on the imperial measurement and referred to as such; in other cases the sizes are too far removed from the imperial size to be referred to by imperial measurement. Lengths can be sold at every 300 mm (a metric approximation of 1'). Common sizes are similar to the North American equivalent; 2.4, 2.7, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, 5.4, 6.0.  But also in running lengths, where each plank in a given packet is different, from  2500mm to 5500mm, though shorter and longer may be present.


=== Hardwoods ===

In North America sizes for dimensional lumber made from hardwoods varies from the sizes for softwoods. Boards are usually supplied in random widths and lengths of a specified thickness, and sold by the board-foot (144 cubic inches).


=== Engineered Lumber ===
Engineered lumber is lumber created by a manufacturer and designed for a certain structural purpose.

Roman art,"Roman art was created in Ancient Rome. It includes architecture, painting, sculptures and mosaic work. It was most prolific from about the first to the fourth century AD. Ancient Roman pottery was not considered to be artwork; it was for everyday use. Almost no painting survives today, and the paintings that are known are probably not the best the Romans could produce.",0
Wooden box,"A wooden box is a container made of wood for storage or as a shipping container.
Construction may include several types of wood; lumber (timber), plywood, engineered woods, etc.  For some purposes, decorative woods are used.


== Boxes as shipping containers ==
Wooden boxes are often used for heavy duty packaging when 

high strength is needed for heavy and difficult loads
long term warehousing may be needed
large size is required
rigidity is required
when stacking strength is critical
Boxes and crates are not the same. If the sheathing of the container (plywood, lumber, etc.) can be removed, and a framed structure will remain standing, the container would likely be termed a crate. If removal of the sheathing resulted in there being no way of fastening the lumber around the edges of the container, the container would likely be termed a wooden box.
The strength of a wooden box is rated based on the weight it can carry before the cap (top, ends, and sides) is installed. ""Skids"" or thick bottom runners, are sometimes specified to allow forklift trucks access for lifting.
Performance is strongly influenced by the specific design, type of wood, type of fasteners (nails, etc.), workmanship, etc.
Some boxes have handles, hand holes, or hand holds.


== Nailed wood box ==


=== Cleated  box ===
A cleated box has five or six panel faces with wood strips attached to them.  The panels can be made of plywood, solid or corrugated fiberboard, etc.  Wooden cleats reinforce the panels.


=== Wirebound box ===
Very thin lumber is used for a wirebound box.  Wires are stapled or stitched to the girth and to wood cleats.  These are sometimes used for produce and for heavy loose items for military or export use.  These are lighter than wood boxes or crates.  They have excellent tensile strength to contain items but not much stacking strength.


=== Skid box ===

A skid box is a wood, corrugated fiberboard, or metal box attached to a heavy duty pallet or platform on a skid (parallel wood runners)

Allotment (travel industry),"Allotments in the tourism industry are used to designate a certain block of pre-negotiated carrier seats or hotel rooms which have been bought out and held by a travel organizer with a huge buying power like a wholesaler, tour operator or hotel consolidator, and more rarely by a retail travel agent.
Allotments can be purchased for a specific period of time such as a whole season, part of a season or for any single dates and then resold to travel partners and final customers around the globe. A couple of days prior to carrier departure/hotel check-in any unsold seats/rooms may be released back to the supplier if such an agreement exists between the two parties. An allotment release back period is also negotiated as part of the allotment contract (e.g. four days prior to check-in/departure).


== Negotiating allotments ==
Allotments can be negotiated between a tour operator and a travel service supplier such as airline company/hotel chain, or between two travel organizers such as a tour operator and a retail travel agent. Either way the buyer needs to prove a consistent level of business, because allotments are hardly granted without any previous sales history.
Rooms or seats that have not been contracted between the travel company and the product supplier are handled as ‘on-request’, where each booking of an airline seat or hotel room needs to be confirmed with the supplier before being confirmed with the client.


== The allotment or allocation contract ==
The amount of the contracted rooms/seats to be specified in the allotment contract is a result of the estimated, during the negotiation, volume of sales to be realized by the tour operator. Tour operators book a certain number of rooms in hotels or seats on carriers and have the right to use them by a given date, also known as a release date, that usually is some days prior to tourist's arrival (hotels)/departure (carriers). The allotment contract reduces the risk of any unsold products by the supplier and grants relative price advantage to the travel organizer helping him to stay competitive on the market by offering extra discounts.
Tour operators obtain discounts, through allotment or commitment contracts, primarily depend on the firm size and the bargaining power exercised; they can vary from 10% to 50% according to the period of the year, the destination, the quantity and quality of services contracted upon. Some big tour operators are able to obtain up to 70% of discount.

Money in Islam,"The free market principle is an Islamic principle as cited per the primary islamic source in the Quran. Islam considers commodities with intrinsic value as currency. The following are some examples of commodities that can be used as currency: gold (as Gold Dinar), silver (as Silver Dirham), dates, wheat, barley, and salt. The mentioned six items are derived from a hadith i.e. gold, silver, dates, wheat, barley, and salt and were used as money in barter system. As the items mentioned in hadith, therefore, also known as Sunnah money.
Paper money or electronic money can be used, as long as, it is backed by one of these commodities at a fixed exchange rate (in other words the paper is just a contract stipulating that the bearer can redeem the paper for a fixed measure (weight) of that particular commodity). Until 1971, most currencies of the world were backed by gold. However, only governments could redeem paper, not the average citizen.
The price of a commodity is set by the market as long as fiat currency (paper) is not used. On the other hand, the price/value of commodities can be manipulated/adjusted by the creators of fiat money (by virtue of the market law of supply and demand).

Sunspot,"A sunspot is an area of high magnetic activity, on the surface of the Sun. Sunspots produce bright light, but not as much as the surface around them, so they appear dark by comparison. They are cooler than the rest of the sun. Some are small, and some are ten times bigger than Earth. 
A sunspot cycle of eleven years has been found, with changes in activity. Every 11 years the number of sunspots increases, and later declines. Sunspots on one cycle are magnetically different from the next, so the total sunspot cycle is 22 years. This cycle has been seen since the 18th century. Before that time, for over a hundred years, there were very few sunspots. Astronomers do not know what caused this ""Maunder Minimum"". 


== History ==

Chinese astronomers said they could see sunspots. On 17 March 802 the monk Adelmus saw a big sunspot, which he could see for eight days. Adelmus thought that Mercury was going in front of the Sun and making a black spot. When astronomers started using telescopes, most agreed that something was passing in front of the Sun. Galileo Galilei in 1612 guessed that there were actual spots on the Sun and that they showed that the Sun was turning.
The first cyclic changes of sunspots was seen by Heinrich Schwabe, and made Rudolf Wolf study them carefully, starting in 1848. Also in 1848, Joseph Henry showed a picture of the Sun and made sure that sunspots were cooler than the rest of the Sun (they are about 7000 degrees Fahrenheit, 4000 C). They are still very hot, but much cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface.


== Effect on Earth ==
Sunspots are cooler than the rest of the Sun.  But many scientists think that when there are many sunspots, the Sun actually gets hotter.  This affects the weather here on Earth, and also radio reception.  If this is true, then without sunspots, the Earth might become cooler.  In the same way, if there were more sunspots, the Earth might become hotter, and there could be less rain.  This would make more droughts on the Earth.  Droughts are a long time with no rain.  Without rain, crops that people eat would not grow.  Scientists study sunspots and other solar phenomena, so they can know what they do to Earth.  The temperature of a sunspot is 4780°K.  This is cold when compared to other areas on the surface of sun.

Malignant,"In medicine, malignant is a clinical word that is used to describe an illness that kills a patient fast. A malignant tumor is a tumor that is able to invade nearby tissues and spread to tissues that are not nearby.  Not all patients diagnosed with malignant tumors die, because of the improved treatments available.  The actual prognosis depends on the type of tumor, its differentiation, and how bad the disease is.  The term malignant is typically applied to neoplasms that show aggressive behavior characterized by local invasion or distant metastasis.",0
Nadir,"In astronomy, the nadir is a point ""below"" a particular location. ""Below"" means in the same direction of gravity at that location. The nadir is the opposite of the zenith.  The nadir is not a real point.  It is used as a reference for the location of other things.

Depictions of nudity,"Depictions of nudity include any images or performances of people without clothing. These images have been made throughout history, both in the arts and sciences. Nudity in real life is restricted in most societies, but visual images of nudity may serve recognized social purposes. In Western societies, these are art, erotic images, including pornography, and information or science. Any image not fitting into one of these functions may be misunderstood, leading to disagreements. One of these disagreements is the difference between artistic and erotic images.


== Nudity in art ==
The human body was one of the first subjects of art, and has remained popular to the present. The traditional fine arts media include drawing, painting, and sculpture. Because they are made of durable materials such a stone, ceramics or metal, older sculptures have survived to the present. Drawings and paintings have survived only in caves or other places protected from the weather.   


=== Nude children in art ===

Works of art, such as paintings, statues, or photographs have shown nude children, or nude children with nude adults. For most of this history, childhood nudity represented innocence, and could be shown anywhere. In recent years, showing nude children in photographs is seen by some as sexual. When photographs were taken to labs for processing, those taken by families showing small children naked were sometimes seen as child pornography by the police. When there is no sexual contact shown, charges have never been sustained. In May 2008, police in Sydney, Australia, raided an exhibition by the photographer Bill Henson. This exhibition showed images of naked adolescents. The raid was done on allegations of child pornography.


=== Nudity in photography ===

Since the beginning of photography, people have taken photographs of nudity. At first, the photos imitated paintings to avoid censorship, or were sold as references for artists.

 In the 20th century, photographers wanted to make photography respected as an art medium. As public nudity became accepted, photos could be taken in a variety of locations rather than only posed in a studio.

In addition to fine art, photography of nudity has also been glamorous, sexual and then pornographic.


== Nudity in popular culture ==
As new media have appeared though history, the human body has been one of the most popular subjects.


=== Nudity in film ===


=== Nudity on television ===
Many countries have made laws that should protect children from seeing sex scenes on television by accident. That way, such scenes may usually not be shown during the day. British TV must not show such scenes between 5.30am and 9pm. The time when content not suitable for children may be shown is called ""watershed"". The Broadcasting Code requires that ""Nudity before the watershed must be justified by the context.""


=== Nudity for advertising ===
Nudity is often used to draw the attention of customers to a given product. That way, nude people or people with very little clothing are often shown on covers of magazines, even if the content of the magazine has nothing to do with nudity. Naked people, sometimes in connection with body painting are used to distribute fliers at events.
This uses erotic stimuli, especially to people of the opposite sex. On the other hand, nudity seems to work all by itself in such contexts. Nudity in public places is rare, and people generally do not expect it. The more it is used however, the less it will act on people. At some point it will have become normal.


== Nudity in live performances ==


=== Theatre ===
Nudity in Western theatre was once limited to models posing in imitation of works of fine art (called ""tableau vivant""). Nude performers could not move while the curtain was open. The Windmill Theatre operated in Soho, London from 1932 to 1964, but could not compete after strip clubs were allowed.
Nudity in American theater began in 1968 with the opening of Hair on Broadway. Nudity on the American stage has become more frequent, but has remained controversial.


=== Dance ===
Nude ballet was accepted in Denmark in the 1970s, but performances by the Royal Danish Ballet in the United States were limited to New York City. Today, nudity has become one of the possible ""costumes"" for modern dance.


=== Erotic performances ===
Public performances that have the intent of arousing sexual interest have a long history, perhaps as long as prostitution. Modern striptease did not end with performers entirely nude until the twentieth century. In the 21st century, sex on stage is allowed in some countries.


== Nude photography ==

Photographic media may be used to create images of all types, artistic, erotic, educational and scientific.


== Erotic images ==

Erotic images are those intended to arouse sexual interest.


== Nudity in science and education ==

Images of the naked body are used to illustrate educational or scientific information.
In the European Renaissance artists performed there own dissections of the human body and drew illustrations.
In the 19th century, photographs of naked Indigenous peoples became popular in Europe. Most claimed to be scientific, or ethnographic images. Whatever the intent, they became commercial (or erotic) images. It is unclear which images were posed, rather than being of everyday attire.
The deep space probes Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972) and 11 (launched April 5, 1973) each carried a metal sheet with a ""message of peace"" for extraterrestrials that might find them. Both are the same, and include line drawings of nude male and female humans. The male has a hand raised in greeting, although its meaning would not likely be clear.

Artist's impression,"An artist's impression, artist's conception, artist's interpretation, or artist's rendition is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract. For example, in architecture, artists' impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape. Artists' impressions are particularly prominent in space art. Artist's depictions of prehistoric life are known as paleoart.

Fantasy coffin,"Fantasy coffins or figurative coffins, also called “FAVs” (fantastic afterlife vehicles) and custom, fantastic, or proverbial coffins (abebuu adekai), are functional coffins made by specialized carpenters in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. These colorful objects, which developed out of figurative palanquins, are not only coffins but considered works of art. They were shown for the first time to a wider Western public in the exhibition Les Magiciens de la terre at the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris in 1989. The seven coffins shown in Paris were made by Kane Kwei (1922–1992) and his former assistant Paa Joe (b. 1947). Since then, coffins by Kane Kwei, his grandson Eric Adjetey Anang, Paa Joe, Daniel Mensah, Kudjoe Affutu, Theophilus Nii Anum Sowah, Benezate, and other artists have been displayed in international art museums and galleries around the world.


== Origin and meaning ==
Fantasy coffins are mainly used by the southern Ghana-based Ga people because of their religious beliefs regarding the afterlife. The Ga believe that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also considered much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still alive, and the social status of the deceased depends in part on the use of an exclusive coffin during burial.
Fantasy coffins are only displayed on the day when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolize the deceased person's profession. Certain shapes, such as a sword or stool, represent regal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in such coffins. Animals such as lions, cockerels and crabs may be used to represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of clan families are permitted to be buried in coffins of that particular shape. Many coffin shapes evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. That is why fantasy coffins are sometimes called proverbial coffins (abebuu adekai) or okadi adekai in the Ga language.


== History ==
 
Among Christians, the use of custom coffins is relatively recent and began in the Greater Accra Region around 1950. They were formerly used only by Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960, figurative coffins have become an integral part of the local funeral culture. Previous to their use by Christians, Ga had been using figurative palanquins and coffins since the early 20th century.
The invention of figurative coffins was at one point attributed to Seth Kane Kwei, though the anthropologists Roberta Bonetti and Regula Tschumi question this myth. The idea of making and using custom coffins was inspired by the figurative palanquins in which the Ga chiefs were carried, and in which they were sometimes buried.  According to some sources, Ataa Oko from La may have started making custom coffins and figurative palanquins around 1945. Along with Kane Kwei from Teshie and Ataa Oko from La, other carpenters may have begun making them in the early 1950s.


== Manufacture ==
Figurative coffins are produced to order. Master carpenters employ one or more apprentices who carry out a large part of the work. This allows the artist to make several coffins simultaneously. Coffins are generally made from the wood of the local wawa tree. In the interest of durability, items produced for museums are made from mahogany or another high-grade hardwood so as to guard against cracking and attacks by insects when transferred from one climate to another. Each coffin takes two to six weeks to produce, depending on the complexity of the construction and the carpenter's level of experience. For urgent orders, several carpenters will work on a single piece. The woodworking is done using simple, non-electric tools. Painting can take up to two days to complete. Some models are painted by the head of the workshop, others by local sign writers, some of whom are well known in the Western art market for making hand-painted movie posters. Coffin-makers and sign-painters usually decide together on the patterns and colors to use for a coffin.


== Notable artists ==


=== Kudjoe Affutu ===
 Kudjoe Affutu was born in 1985 in Awutu Bawyiase, Central Region, Ghana. He was trained from 2002 to 2006 by Paa Joe in Nungua, Greater Accra Region. Since 2007 he has run his own workshop in Awutu Bawyiase, Central Region. 
Kudjoe Affutu has collaborated with various European artists, including Thomas Demand, Sâadane Afif and the artist duo M.S. Bastian/Isabelle L. Kudjoe Affutu's coffins have been exhibited at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Tinguely Museum in Basel, the Nouveau Musée National de Monaco and the Musée d'ethnographie Neuchâtel. He later became specialized in the production of miniature coffins, a selection of which were shown in 2018 and 2019 at the Museum der Völker in Austria and in 2020 at the Kunsthalle Hamburg. Kudjoe Affutu has also worked with the Ghanaian curator Nana Oforiatta Ayim, who included his work in the opening exhibition of her gallery in Accra in 2017.


=== Eric Adjetey Anang ===
Born in 1985, Eric Adjetey Anang is the grandson of Seth Kane Kwei. He has run the Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop with his father Cedi since 2005, after graduating from Accra Academy. Since 2009, he has been the subject of several documentaries produced in the UK, France, Brazil, Japan, Norway and the USA. He has been a resident artist in Russia, USA, Belgium, Denmark and organizes residences for foreign artists in Ghana. He was invited to Italy for Milan Design Week in 2013 and South Korea for the Gwangju Biennale of Design in 2011.


=== Paa Joe ===

Paa Joe was born in 1947 in the region of Akwapim, Ghana. He completed an apprenticeship with Kane Kwei in Teshie but left in 1974. In 1976, he opened his own workshop in Nungua. In 1989, he was invited to show his work in the exhibition ""Les Magiciens de la terre"" in Paris. Since then, his coffins have been shown all over the world. In 2005, they were exhibited in the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York and Jack Bell Gallery London. In 2006, he participated in the exhibition ""Six Feet Under"" at the Kunstmuseum Bern. In 2007, he opened a new workshop in Pobiman near Accra and in May 2013 he was in a resident artist in the UK with his son Jacob. He was the subject of the Artdocs film Paa Joe and the Lion directed by Benjamin Wigley and produced by Anna Griffin, released in 2016.


=== Eric Kpakpo ===
Eric Kpakpo was born in 1979 in Nungua, Ghana. He studied carpentry from 1994 until 2000 at Paa Joe's workshop in Nungua. He remained there as a master carpenter until 2006, when he opened his own coffin workshop in La and became one of the most successful coffin artists in his region. He occasionally works with his former master Paa Joe. He has also made a name for himself in the international art market, particularly for his miniature coffins. In 2019, Kpakpo's work was shown in Ghana at the mobile museum of the Ghanaian curator Nana Oforiatta Ayim. In 2024 the artist was part of the group show Magic Ghana at the gallery Magnin-A in Paris.


=== Daniel ""Hello"" Mensah ===

Daniel Mensah, also known as ""Hello,"" was born in 1968 in Teshie, Ghana. He completed a six-year apprenticeship with Paa Joe in Nungua before spending eight more years with Paa Joe. In 1998, he opened his own studio, Hello Design Coffin Works, in Teshie. His work has been shown in various international art exhibitions and European films. In 2011, his work was shown at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts.


=== Ataa Oko ===

Ataa Oko was born in the coastal town of La, Ghana. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. Until 2002, he made coffins only for Ghanaian customers and thus remained unknown in Western art circles. In 2006, his work was exhibited for the first time at an art museum in Bern.  Uninfluenced by Western customers, Ataa Oko developed his own form of artistic language. His work is therefore different from artists in Kane Kwei's tradition, not only in terms of design and materials but in overall appearance.  From 2005 until his death in 2012, he worked as a painter under the supervision of anthropologist Regula Tschumi. In 2010-11 he had his first one-man show in a Western art museum, in the Collection de l'Art Brut in Lausanne.

Wood lagging,"Wood lagging is a method of banding wooden slats around pipelines to protect against impact, abrasion, and corrosion. Wooden lagging acts as a sheath, protecting the pipeline from  damage, and is especially useful in rocky terrain; steep inclines; around rivers or swampy areas; and other rough terrain. Boiler lagging is akin to pipe lagging, but is used to protect steam boilers.
Wood lagging has been used on notable pipelines such as The Trans-Mountain Pipeline, which spans the Canadian Rockies, since 1953, and The Kinder Morgan TMX Anchor Loop. The latter, constructed in 2007, used wood lagging in the environmentally-sensitive terrain and river crossings of Alberta's Jasper National Park.


== Overview ==


=== Construction process ===

Wood lagging is one of several solutions employed by pipeline engineers to provide mechanical protection for underground pipelines. Others include concrete coating, rockshield, high-density polyethylene, imported sand padding, and padding machines.
Wood lagging involves wiring a series of wooden slats together to create a 'blanket'.  This blanket of wooden slats is then dropped over and wrapped around the outside of a pipeline, with or without coating, and secured with steel or plastic banding.
Once wood lagging is installed, the pipeline can be buried and backfilled.  (Wood lagging is installed as part of the “padding and backfill” stage of construction.)
For pipelines that encounter saturated soils or water, wood lagging is often installed in between bolt-on concrete weights, acting as a spacer to keep the weights in place as well as to provide mechanical protection to the pipe.  River weights are generally used at river and creek crossings to counteract the buoyancy of pipelines in stream, high water table situations, or in swampy areas.


=== Characteristics ===
Wood lagging is especially useful to protect pipelines in rocky terrain; steep inclines; around rivers or swampy areas; and in areas with poor natural availability of padding, such as sand or gravel.
Wood lagging is light, flexible, and easy to install at construction sites.  As a method for protecting pipelines, wood lagging offers high-impact resistance at a considerably reduced cost compared to other types of pipeline protection, such as concrete coating.
Materials for wood lagging can often be sourced regionally near pipeline construction sites, reducing transportation time and costs. Wood used in wood lagging is a renewable resource that creates a carbon sequestration effect after pipeline burial, providing minimal environmental impact compared to other types of pipeline protection.


=== Historic and modern uses ===
The longevity of wood lagging that has been installed underground is unknown.  However, intact wood lagging has been found still performing its function more than 50 years after installation:

The Trans-Mountain Pipeline, which spans the Canadian Rockies, the mountainous region of central British Columbia, and 98 streams and rivers, used wood lagging to protect an expanse of pipe crossing the Coquihalla Canyon.  Archival film footage shows the use of wood lagging during its installation in 1953.
Modern examples of wood lagging used to protect oil and natural gas pipelines include:

The BC Gas Southern Crossing Pipeline, constructed in 2000.  Wood lagging was used in approximately 22 km of the 315 km pipeline route.
The Kinder Morgan TMX Anchor Loop, constructed in 2007 by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners.  Wood lagging was used to protect the pipeline in the environmentally-sensitive terrain and river crossings in Jasper National Park in Alberta. In this case, two-by-four inch slats were strapped over the pipes to provide extra protection against the rough terrain of the Rocky Mountains.
Sun Canadian's company policy is to cover exposed pipes with wood lagging.
A different, but related, use of wooden slats was for lagging steam boilers, for example in trains.

Wood processing,"Wood processing is an engineering discipline in the wood industry comprising the production of forest products, such as pulp and paper, construction materials, and tall oil. Paper engineering is a subfield of wood processing.
The major wood product categories are:  sawn timber, wood-based panels, wood chips, paper and paper products and miscellaneous others including poles and railway sleepers.
Forest product processing technologies have undergone extraordinary advances in some of the above categories. Improvements have been achieved in recovery rates, durability and protection, greater utilization of NTFPs such as various grain stalks and bamboo, and the development of new products such as reconstituted wood-panels. Progress has not been homogeneous in all the forest product utilization categories. Although there is little information available on the subjects of technology acquisition, adaptation and innovation for the forest-based industrial sector, it is clear that sawmilling has been far less affected by the spread of innovations than the manufacturing of panel products.
Wood processing produces additives for further processing of timber, wood chips, cellulose and other prefabricated material. 

To look at more perspectives of wood processing you can learn many ways from different countries. This source I found explains a process that Russia uses for there wood processing and will help understand more of the general process.  Although learning how wood processing works gets you so far it is important to learn how to get into manufacturing and selling the processed wood you will need some guidance.  Some major key points to think about while discussing wood processing are what are the main aspects that go into it. Things such as small and large operations.  To break it down even further there are 4 main steps to processing wood. They are cutting, the planning, shaping, and the sanding. It is important that every one of these steps is organized and done right for the wood to be the best quality it can.  On the other side of the wood processing discussion is are there any bi products of processing wood. Some things that are left behind in the mills are bark, sawdust, and black liquor. These bi-products are used to keep fueling the mills. This is a really good way to not harm the environment but also save money using this as fuel.

Astronomer,"An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth. Astronomers observe astronomical objects, such as stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies – in either observational (by analyzing the data) or theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. A related but distinct subject is physical cosmology, which studies the Universe as a whole.


== Types ==
Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types: observational and theoretical. Observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work.
Further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy, galactic astronomy, or physical cosmology.


== Academic ==


=== History ===

Historically, astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky, while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms ""astronomer"" and ""astrophysicist"" are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities. They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.
The American Astronomical Society, which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, geology, and engineering, whose research interests are closely related to astronomy. The International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.

Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time. Before CCDs, photographic plates were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes, usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.


=== Activities and graduate degree training ===
Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs, including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums, as a public service to encourage interest in the field.
Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in physics, mathematics, sciences, and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write, and present papers are part of the higher education of an astronomer, while most astronomers attain both a Master's degree and eventually a PhD degree in astronomy, physics or astrophysics.
PhD training typically involves 5-6 years of study, including completion of upper-level courses in the core sciences, a competency examination, experience with teaching undergraduates and participating in outreach programs, work on research projects under the student's supervising professor, completion of a PhD thesis, and passing a final oral exam. Throughout the PhD training, a successful student is financially supported with a stipend.


== Amateur astronomers ==

While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among amateurs. Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties. The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations. 
As with any hobby, most people who practice amateur astronomy may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called ""armchair astronomers"" to the highly ambitious people who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries, create astrophotographs, and assist professional astronomers in research.

The Forest Stewardship Council has certified the Pacific Albus plantation as meeting FSC environmental and social goals. The tree farm has 24,807 acres of the hardwood trees.",1
Source code,"In computer programming, source code is (generally speaking) a text file version of a computer program or software that contains instructions that the computer follows to do something. Source code is written in a programming language which a human can read and change.  A large program may contain many different source code files that all work together. Source code is in many cases compiled before running it. That means translating the code into assembly language or machine language which is much faster and easier for the computer to read, but hard for a human to read. Another very common way is to interpret the code, without needing a compilation step, while that's generally slower.
A computer program may be open source, which means the source code is shared with anyone who wants to look at it and change it. Many programs are however closed source, which means only the executable code is distributed and people are not allowed to look at and change the code. Many open source programs are also compiled to such code, that may or may not be allowed to be inspected, while to change it is most convenient to change the source code that came with it, or possibly can be downloaded.

Divine presence,"Divine presence, presence of God, Inner God, or simply presence is a concept in religion, spirituality, and theology that deals with the ability of a deity to be ""present"" with human beings, sometimes associated with omnipresence.


== Conceptualizations ==
The concept is shared by many religious traditions, is found in a number of independently derived conceptualizations, and each of these has culturally distinct terminology. Some of the various relevant concepts and terms are:

Immanence – usually applied in monotheistic, pantheistic, pandeistic, or panentheistic faiths to suggest that the spiritual world permeates the mundane. It is often contrasted with transcendence, in which the divine is seen to be outside the material world.
Inner light – in various religions, the presence of God as a ""light"". The Religious Society of Friends regards this concept as a fundamental belief.
Divine light – an aspect of divine presence with qualities of illumination: thought, intellect, knowledge, insight, wisdom, being, divine love.
Numen – Latin term for ""presence"", used historically to refer to a Roman religious concept.
Theophany – the appearance of a deity to a human.
Higher consciousness–is the consciousness of a higher Self, transcendental reality, or God.


== Abrahamic religions ==


=== Judaism ===
Angel of the Presence – an entity variously considered angelic or else identified with God himself.
Shekhinah – the dwelling or settling of the divine presence of God and his cosmic glory.
The Sages of Israel have given expression of the Divine Presence (Hebrew: Shekhinah) in their writings:

The Divine Presence rests not [upon man] through sadness, neither through sloth, nor through jesting, nor through levity, nor through loquacity, nor through [a host of] vain pursuits, but rather through the joyful performance of keeping one’s religious duty.


=== Christianity ===

Immanuel – ""God with us,"" is a Biblical concept that deals with the concept of divine presence, often used by Christians as a title for Jesus
Incarnation (Christianity) – Believed to be the second person of the Trinity, also known as God the Son or the Logos (Word), ""became flesh"" by being conceived in the womb of Mary.
Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in the Eucharist, although they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, some believe that they actually become the body and blood of Christ, others believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present in, with, and under the bread and wine which remain physically unchanged, others believe in a real but purely spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and still others take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper.

Transubstantiation – Catholic sacramental doctrine – Catholic and Orthodox (terminology differs) concept of Christ fully, truly and substantially present in the Eucharist with the physical species being substantially absent.
Consubstantiation – Christian theological doctrine – Lutheran concept of Christ being ""infused"" within the species of communion with these aspects still substantially present.


=== Islam (and Sufism) ===
Divine Presence in Islam is known as ""Hadra"" and the human experience of it is known as ""Hudur"".
Practices in Sufism intended to evoke Hudur usually characterize it as ""the heart's presence with Allah"" (""Hudur al-Qalb"").  Examples of such practices include:

The Haḍra group ritual
Muraqabah (meditation) in general
Realization of the Jism Latif subtle body through practice with the Lataif-e-Sitta

Compliance (medicine),"In medicine, compliance or adherence refers to the fact that a patient follows the advice of the doctor, and takes the prescribed drugs in the quantities prescribed. Compliance is important for the treatment of chronic diseases.
Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. In 2003,   the World Health Organization estimated that only about half the patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations. In particular, low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma, diabetes, and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions. Compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature, as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal clinical trial but drops off in a ""real-world"" setting.
Some drugs are difficult to take, because they must be taken at a specific time or interval; sometimes, several drugs must be taken together. This is seen as a major obstacle to compliance.  Other factors that may adversely influence compliance are that many patients do not understand the benefits of being treated, or they see side-effects that they were not told about, the drugs costing a lot of money, poor communication or lack of trust between the patient and their health-care provider. Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying drug packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed at the same time.

Free Money Day,"Free Money Day is a global social experiment held annually on September 15, the anniversary of the Lehman Brothers' 2008 filing for bankruptcy. Participants hand out money to strangers, asking them to pass half onto someone else. Money is exchanged in person, left as a surprise for someone to find, or sent digitally. Founded in 2011 by Donnie Maclurcan, co-founder and co-director of the Post Growth Institute, Free Money Day is a social experiment that is meant to explore people's attachment to money and remind people that it must freely circulate in a successful economy, as noted by Maclurcan:

""Just like any system in the human and eco-sphere requires circulation, whether it's nitrogen or oxygen flowing through our ecology, whether it's blood flowing through our bodies. We need money which is the lifeblood of the economy to circulate – and currently, it doesn't.""
Since its inception, Free Money Day has been celebrated through 324 events organized in 218 locations in 35 countries, with many more unreported events.
Free Money Day is an initiative of the Post Growth Institute (PGI), an international, not-for-profit organization leading the shift to a world where people, companies and nature thrive together within ecological limits. The PGI works collaboratively to develop ideas, programs, events and alliances that promote the equitable circulation of money, power and resources in our local communities and global economy.
In addition to sharing money, people have sought alternative ways to participate in Free Money Day. This has included giving out money to strangers in exchange for them listening to their music, organizing a free sewing workshop, or a video store handing out free movie rentals to customers.

Tracheid,"Tracheids are long cells in the xylem of vascular plants. They  transport water and mineral salts. Tracheids are one of two types of elements in the xylem, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids do not have perforation plates; vessel elements do. These define vascular plants, as opposed to  non-vascular plants.
All tracheary elements get a thick lignified cell wall. When the plant is mature, the protoplast has broken down and disappeared.  Tracheids have two functions. They transport material and provide structural support.
The secondary walls have thickenings in various forms: rings, spirals, networks or as extensive thickenings except where there are pits. Tracheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type.
Because tracheids have a much larger surface area to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring. This mechanism helps plants prevent air embolisms.
The term ""tracheid"" was introduced by Carl Sanio in 1863, originally as Tracheide, in German.

Paradise,"Paradise (often called Heaven, the Garden or Kingdom Come) is an idea in religion. It is a place where everything is good.",0
Environmental theology,"Environmental theology pertains to ""the God-environment relationship and divine expectations of human behavior in relation to the environment"".


== History ==
The history of Environmental Theology is often regarded as a new age idea developed in the last one hundred years, however, evidence shows that its roots can be traced back to Saint Francis of Assisi. His sermon to the birds is referred to often when discussing early Environmental Theology. It is also discussed for its radical ideas for the time period.
“The Historical Roots of our Ecological Crisis” is the most prominent citation in a literature review on Environmental Theology. Written by Dr. Lynn White Jr. in 1967, ""The Historical Roots of our Ecological Crisis"" remains one of the core pieces of literature to all environmental theologians. In this infamous publication, Dr. Lynn White Jr. proposed the idea that the current ecological crisis can trace its roots back to the Bible and man's interpretation of Gods words. He discusses his ideas that Western Christianity overemphasizes an anthropocentric view of the environment that has led to the destruction of the environment over millennia. He instead proposes that Christianity to move towards a more nurturing approach to nature. At the end of his essay, Dr. Lynn White Jr. nominated Saint Francis of Assisi to be the patron saint of ecologists.
Writings in environmental theology normally cover two veins of thought, one sector being a belief system and the other sector being a behavior system. It is commonly found that documents closely associated with environmental theology do not directly define the term. A definition for environmental theology was finally proposed in 2001 – ""a term used to describe the God-environment relationship and divine expectations of human behavior in relation to the environment"".


== Basic environmental theology ==
Environmental theology generally must include an understanding of God's relationship to the cosmos or Creation, a cosmology. Robert J. Jacobus divides the possibilities into three basic views of God’s physical relationship with the environment. One, the Creator-God exists externally to the physical world (Timm, 1994). The second is God exists internally in the environment (McFague, 1993, Tobias, 1994). The third basic view stipulates God as an entity does not exist (Berry, 1994; Callicott, 1994; Swimme, 1994; Wei-ming, 1994). Three variations of these basic types can be identified in literature. The first is the person of God can be distinctly separate from the environment and also exist internally in the environment (White, 1994). A second variation purports that God and nature exist as separate deities (Griffin, 1994). The third variation denies God as a cognitive entity and views the environment as Creator/deity. If God is external to the environment God then the Creator-God interfaces with the environment as a distinct entity, while if God is internal to the environment, one may make no distinction between the person of God and the environment and the notion of Creator itself may become problematic. A mystical viewpoint common to several religious traditions that unites these categories is that God is continuously creating the universe, and that the universe is a direct expression of God's being, rather than an object created by God as the subject.
From the environmental perspective the corresponding worldviews would be (1) nature is created, (2) nature is divine and (3) nature is emergent.  Three environmental theologies emerge, (1) God exists eternally and the environment is God's creation, (2) the environment is God (Nelson, 1990) and (3) the environment emerged from physical conditions (Fraley, 2000). But Robert S. Corrington goes so far as to say that God is an emergent property of the cosmos itself.
There is not a clear distinction between environmental theology and ecotheology, though the term environmental theology might indicate a theology in which environmental ethics is established prior to one's understanding of the meaning of God.


== Discussions in environmental theology ==
Many discussions have been held since the publication of ""Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis"". In fact the number of articles written regarding Environmental Theology increased substantially in the years after its publication. The peak number of publications occurred in 1971 with 80 articles written regarding Environmentalism in the Judeo-Christian traditions. A vast majority of publications focuses on the concept of anthropocentracism being the driving force of our ecological crisis. There are some articles that have been written that support the concept of anthropocentrism. Constance Cumbey and David Hunt both published books in 1983 that refuted the ideas of Dr. Lynn White jr. and other theologians, they instead discussed the idea that God did not care for the earth and that it was not up to man to care for it. There are also those who believe that the teachings of Environmental Theology are too radical to have real world effects. The Cornwall Alliance is a group that has formed to protest the ideology that anthropocentrism is the issue and instead teach it as the solution.

Analogia entis,"The analogia entis (Latin for ""analogy of being"") is the philosophical claim that the class of relationship of the ""being"" of created things and the ""being"" of God is one of ""analogy"", and also the theological and devotional ramifications of this. 
This entails that God's existence is entirely different to the being and modes of being of all things in the cosmos (all ""creatures"") and therefore to us is ineffable directly. It has also been summarized as the proposition that there is no (e.g. natural or conceptual) system of which God and creatures are both part. However, analogy can provide true but indirect (though not necessarily reliable) cognition. Other predications apart from ""being"" may be treated in the same way.
It has been called a guiding  principle of Catholic thought  (or Denkform) which synthesizes many disparate themes in Catholic doctrine and theology: that general names or predications about God (not only names such as ""is a Consuming Fire"", ""is our Father"", ""is Patient"" and predications of perfections ""is infinite"", ""is love"", ""is just"", but even being itself: that God ""is"") are true but analogies. It is associated with the Latin phrase ""maior dissimulitudo in tanta similitudine"": 

For between creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them.
The modern formulation of the analogia entis emphasizes a cognitive rhythm: the double motion in and beyond:

What is meant by analogia entis is precisely this: that in the very same act in which the human being comes to intimate God in the likeness of the creature, he also comes to intimate Him as the one who is beyond all likeness.


== Background ==
There is no single, universally authoritative, and unambiguous doctrine of the analogia entis. 
Analogia entis has had rather different meanings in particular philosophical, theological or devotional disciplines: sometimes with broad meaning (e.g., used for any divine predication) or narrow meaning (e.g., used strictly about divine being only), and sometimes used to name its perceived implications.


=== Development ===
The term was originally coined around 1350 by Albert Magnus and developed subsequently, notably in the 1920s and 1930s by Jesuit Erich Przywara and German theologians, such as former Jesuit Hans Urs von Balthasar. The concept has a longer history than the term, and drew on commentary by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Aristotle.


=== Analogy ===

Analogia entis is not a fancy synonym for analogy; however, the term is sometimes enlarged so that 'being' includes all kinds of analogous predication about God not just essential and infinite being.
Analogy has the general form A is to B as C is to D:

A : B :: C : D

So ""one and the same term is analogically attributed to two realities whenever it is  attributed to each of them in a way which is partially the same and partially different.""
Some analogies get presented condensed (e.g., into metaphors) by leaving out terms so that one thing is referred to by mentioning another: A is a C. (There is a core case, which other terms relate to in various pros hen ways.: 119 )  So ""God is Good"" is the analogy ""the goodness of humans is to their nature as the goodness of God is to his nature..""
Analogical reasoning can be distinguished from other modes, such as induction and deduction. Analogical statements can be distinguished from other kinds of statement, such as univocal and equivocal.
Such analogy is asymmetric,: 119  working in one direction only: the metaphor ""God is Father"" (i.e., the analogy ""God is to us as a human father is to their child"") does not imply ""Father is God."" Similarly, an analogical statement does not rule out another statement that would be contradictory if interpreted univocally: ""God is Father"" does not rule out ""God is Mother."" But every analogy breaks down when extended too far.
In Christian thought, God is commonly analogized against many created or experienced things: being, goodness, truth, beauty, just, kind, love, a friend, a judge, an advocate, a fire, a hound, a worm, divine law.


=== Cognition ===
Scientist Douglas Hofstadter has claimed that analogy is the ""core of human cognition."" Pseudo-Dionysius' purported book Symbolic Theology discussed dissimilar similarities and the need for the human mind to have and use symbols.
One facet of analogia entis is as a fallible, non-mystical human cognitive event involving the characteristic double motion of in-and-beyond (and distinct from deduction, intuition, instress, etc.) and subsequent unresolvable oscillation.


==== Religious cognition ====
In Catholic usage, the analogia entis is a foundational organizing and epistemological principle of religious cognition:  for Bonaventure, for example, the cosmos is conceived as a treasury of things that can be used for analogy.

All created things of the sensible world lead the mind of the contemplator and wise man to eternal God[...] They are the shades, the resonances, the pictures of that efficient, exemplifying, and ordering art; they are the tracks, simulacra, and spectacles; they are divinely given signs set before us for the purpose of seeing God. They are exemplifications set before our still unrefined and sense-oriented minds, so that by the sensible things which they see they might be transferred to the intelligible which they cannot see, as if by signs to the signified.""
Aquinas' ideas on analogy presuppose that ""cognition of the supernatural realm cannot be attained from this world by the mere exercise of our natural cognitive powers, but only through divine revelation and faith in the content of this revelation."": 417 
Modern Popes have treated analogy as one cognitive mechanism which revelation may use:

I want only to state that reality and truth do transcend the factual and the empirical, and to vindicate the human being's capacity to know this transcendent and metaphysical dimension in a way that is true and certain, albeit imperfect and analogical. [...]Faith clearly presupposes that human language is capable of expressing divine and transcendent reality in a universal way—analogically, it is true, but no less meaningfully for that.


== Philosophical ==


=== Analogy ===

Medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas took the distinction between the univocal and equivocal terms from Aristotle's Categories and also an intermediate but distinct kind:  analogical terms where you understand something greater by the measure of something lesser. For Aquinas, ""nothing can be said in the same sense of God and creatures.""   According to theologian K. Surin ""at the heart of Aquinas' views on the nature of language about God is his thesis that all assertions about God are to be construed analogically."" This linguistic thesis then is the ground for his metaphysical theses.
Thomas Cajetan attempted to reduce all analogy to three kinds (inequality, attribution, proportionality) and state which ones, in logical use, could be used syllogistically.
In the modern version of analogia entis, while the object providing the ""measure"" can be any thing, the subject of the intimation is specifically God.
The thing being measured may not only be some created thing or positive transcendental or perfection (i.e. things having 'being' in some real or metaphysical sense) but also a negative thing or absence: seeing in some bad thing the absence of expected good provides the analogy for reckoning God as the being with no absence of good (in) then seeing (beyond) that God is infinitely more than 'good'.


=== Predication and names of God ===
Following from the Fourth Lateran Council, all ""God is ..."" statements must be interpreted analogically not absolutely. For example, all the following cases are analogies because love, fire, unity, etc are limited (at least by having finite definitions) while God is not limited.

Deuteronomy 4:24 ""For the LORD your God is a consuming fire""
Deuteronomy 6:4 ""The LORD our God, the LORD is one""
Psalms 84:11 ""For the LORD God is a sun and shield""
1 John 1:5 ""God is light; in him there is no darkness at all""
1 John 4:8 ""God is love""
Aquinas discussed this as analogia nominum (analogy of names).

Exodus 3:14 ""I am who am""
For St Thomas Aquinas, even ""being"" as in: ""I am who am"" of Exodus 3:14, is an analogy when used of God: our understanding God's ""being"" is by analogy to our being.

[...] whatever names unqualifiedly designate a perfection without defect are predicated of God and of other things: for example, goodness, wisdom, being, and the like. But when any name expresses such perfections along with a mode that is proper to a creature, it can be said of God only according to likeness and metaphor. [...] For we cannot grasp what God is, but only what He is not and how other things are related to Him[...]


=== Dialectic ===
Theologian Ivor Morris saw Analogia entis as dialecticism, ""though not of the Hegelian kind, the obvious difference being that[...]the movement of thought is poised between thesis and antithesis and never advances, as with Hegel, to the idea of a higher synthesis."" Przywara saw this unresolving 'poise' more dynamically, as a cognitive/logical trembling or oscillation between the thesis in and antithesis beyond.


=== Epistemology ===
Thomas Aquinas wrote:

Our natural knowledge begins from sense. It can therefore extend so far as it can be led by sensible things.[...]But since effects depend on their cause, sensible things can lead us to know that God exists, and to know what is bound to be attributable to him as the first cause of all things, and as transcending all his effects. In this way we know that God is related to creatures as the cause of them all; that he differs from creatures, since he is none of the things caused by him; and that creatures are separated from God because God transcends them, not because of any defect in God


=== Metaphysics ===
The metaphysical distinction between essence and existence in all beings apart from God is termed the real distinction.
In Thomistic theology, God is whose essence is his existence.


==== Ontology ====
Key proponents of analogia entis position it as theology not philosophy. John Betz summarizes Przywara's stance: ""For as of yet, from a purely philosophical perspective, nothing whatsoever can be made out about who God is or what he has revealed, or even that there is such thing as revelation.""
However it is to some extent founded on a philosophical claim about the ""ground of being"" of creatures which then allows such theology. Przywara's argument is that ""All that can be made out metaphysically with any degree of certainty apart from revelation is that creaturely being is not its own ground, that it is not being itself, that it 'is' only in the form of becoming, and that theology, that is, the science of a God of revelation, is a reasonable possibility or to put it in still more minimalist terms, a 'non-impossibility'"" 


=== Phenomenology ===
For Edith Stein the relationship between Being and Becoming is analogia entis; 'being' is anything we can think of; she distinguished finite and infinite being.
""We speak of God in the best ways that are available to us by ascribing to God in an analogous way the perfections found in creatures.""


==== Theophany ====
For Stein, the analogia entis is  a relation between two ""I am"": the human and creatural ""I am"" and the divine ""I am."" 
Stein starts with the phenomenon of individual awareness, ego cognito: ""my certitude about my own existence is the most primordial, intimate and immediate self-experience I can have"": this real, temporal, finite being that one experiences as her own is an analogue of (""faintly visible"") divine, eternal being.


=== Detractors ===
14th century philosopher-theologian John Duns Scotus and some subsequent theologians propose a Univocity of being:  that God's existence and our existence is the same concept of being, though in different modes.


== Theological ==


=== Biblical roots ===
Multiple passages in the Bible decry the human ability to directly grasp and understanding God directly or well. Isaiah 55:8 ""My ways are not your ways, and neither are my thoughts your thoughts."" Rom 11:34 ""Who has known the mind of God?""
However, Psalm 19:1 ""The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.""
""For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."" (Romans 1:20)
The Peshitta version of I Cor 12:13 translated to Aramaic then to English expresses it: ""Now we see as in a mirror, in an allegory, but then face-to-face. Now I know partially, but then I shall know as I am known."" (I Cor 12:13)


=== Catholic formulation ===
The idea was found implicitly in  Book XV of Augustine's De Trinitate.
The major formulation of the idea was given in passing—in a comment that the kind of perfection in grace that humans could attain is not the same as the perfection of God but only analogous—by the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 ""For between creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them."" (Latin: maior dissimulitudo in tanta similitudine)


=== Scholastic formulations ===


==== Aquinas ====
Thomas Aquinas provides a three-fold distinction: ""We do not know what God is but only what is he is not and what relation he maintains with everything"" Summa contra Gentiles I:30: It is this relation that is the basis of analogia entis. For Aquinas, the analogia entis is placed as a form of knowledge that is intermediate but distinct from what is known by the positive theology via causalitatis (Cataphatic theology)  and by what is known via negativa (Apophatic theology): this is called the via eminentiae. The analogia entis is not cataphatic, in the sense associated with Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, because analogy does not limit God. 
Aquinas situates this in a typical descent-ascent (exitus-reditus) movement: God's perfections (e.g. ""Good"") perpetually descend to creatures, are noticed and named by intellects; in turn, ""the intellect that assigns the names ascends from creatures to God"". Thus any psychological ascent is consequent to this providential descent (i.e. it is not autonomous revelation independent of grace, but an effect of grace.)


==== Anselm ====
Anselm of Canterbury's Proslogion first addresses God as ""you are that than which a greater cannot be conceived"" [emphasis added] (his famous Ontological argument) but then ""you are that which greater than can be conceived"" [emphasis added]: interpreted by analogia entis the former is the in step and the latter is the beyond step: a paradox perhaps but not a contradiction.
Anselm fills out the beyond step stating that ""God is before and beyond even eternal things"" and ""that he alone is what he is and who he is.""


==== Late ====
Notable 16th Century scholastic formulators of analogia entis were Thomas Cajetan and John of St. Thomas, and Francisco Suárez's Disputationes Metaphysicae. (Betz)


==== Descartes ====
According to historian William Ashworth, Descartes held that God's immutability was the ground of natural laws and the conservation of motion, but denied that the world was ""a collection of signs that demonstrated divine attributes or pointed to God."": 140   However, his philosophy has been called a kind of analogia entis argument for the inner world only in its concern for essense, existence and cognition, even though it rejects the remainder of scholastic theology.


=== Modern formulations ===
Until recently, most of the key 20th century theological writings on analogia entis were unknown and unavailable in English. Consequently, it has had a much greater influence on continental (especially German-reading Catholic) theologians than anglophone ones.


==== Erich Pryzwara ====
The modern positioning of analogia entis as being essential to (and quintessential of) Catholic theology was driven by mid-century Jesuit theologian Fr. Erich Przywara. Analogia entis explicates a key part of Jesuit spirituality: St Augustine's dynamic slogan  Latin: Deus semper major (""God is always greater"")  was the title of Przywara's theological commentary on the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola.
For example his difficult 1932 book Analogia Entis: Metaphysics: Original Structure and Universal Rhythm  provides a major formulation of the idea: this ever-greater God ""explodes the limits of every metaphysics as such.""  Theologian John Milbank has called this book ""one of the great masterworks of twentieth-century theology and philosophy.""
Przywara's thought has been summarized as ""the more we grow towards God, the more we realise how much further than we thought we need to grow"",: 678 
Pryzwara saw the analogia entis as central or essential to Catholic theology, to truth and indeed to reality: we understand by (or receive inspiration from) mediating analogies. For Przywara, the analogy entis is a communication from God that calls the believer into service (kenosis).
For Przywara, the analogia entis is nothing more than God's concurrent immanence (in the world) and transcendence (beyond the world). In Przywara's view, numerous Catholic doctrines and devotions flow from the analogia entis as a noetic form, such as the Catholic understanding of the Incarnation, synergism (the cooperation of humans and God in salvation), sacramentalism, mystical piety, religious authority and community, the example of Mary, and the nature of the church.

Far from being a rhetorical trope or a philosophical tool, analogy for Przywara is the style of thought that best corresponds to the way in which being makes itself known. Not only is analogy, for Przywara, built into every level of Catholic theology. It is the glue that holds those levels together.


==== Hans Urs von Balthasar ====
For Przywara's protégé Fr. Hans Urs von Balthasar, Christ is the ""concrete analogy of being"", being both God and man: we learn everything of God by looking at Christ as the measure.
For Przywara and many subsequent theologians, such as Hans Urs von Balthasar, analogia entis is seen as a primary tool by which a multitude of apparently disparate things (such as the Real Distinction) have a unity, and can be analyzed or weighed (and this to the extent that analogia entis has been criticised as a theological panacea.)
Von Baltasar responds to Barth's concern that analogia entis sidelines Christ for scholastic wordplay, with a theology that Christ's homostatic union (as both God and man) itself is a necessary analogy of the divine homoousios within the Trinity.: 540 
Von Balthasar invokes the analogia entis in multiple other places: 

He further says The saint is right, contrary to all those who see him from the outside, to feel that he is the worst sinner and failure (because the saint knows more than us due to their analogia entis experience of God' holiness.)
As an implication, because analogous statements are approximate, a certain Christological and theological pluralism (Catholicism) is necessarily due to these individual limitations.: 1j 
The analogia entis is a condition of good theology and a test of bad theology.


==== Joseph Ratzinger ====
Pope Benedict XVI's Regensberg address said:

The faith of the Church has always insisted that between God and us, between his eternal Creator Spirit and our created reason, there exists a real analogy, in which - as the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 stated - unlikeness remains infinitely greater than likeness, yet not to the point of abolishing analogy and its language. God does not become more divine when we push him away from us in a sheer, impenetrable voluntarism; rather, the truly divine God is the God who has revealed himself as logos and, as logos, has acted and continues to act lovingly on our behalf.
That analogy is real is the ground by which we can say that what is measured (i.e. in) and what is beyond, though so great, are not so different in kind and scale as to be meaningless, because what is in is there because of the free choice of the creator and so allows him to reveal himself.
Pope Benedict also spoke of ""the great et-et"" (both-and) of Catholicism: both faith and works, Jesus being both God and Man, etc, things which are in apparent contradiction: for proponents of analogia entis it provides a resolution without falling into paradox.


=== Orthodox treatment ===
The modern Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart uses the analogia entis in his book The Beauty of the Infinite, noting ""The analogy of being does not analogize God and creatures under the more general category of being, but is the analogization of being (itself) in the difference between God and creatures."" (p241-2) 
However Orthodox theologian John Romanides claimed that ""the very presuppositions of (Augustian) theology (whether) based on analogia entis and analogia fidei has nothing in common with the Fathers of the Roman Ecumenical Councils"" and they are ""not accepted by any Orthodox Father of the Church."" In this view, there is simply no similarity between creature and creator, no possible analogy. One criticism is that analogia entis promotes an intellective ascent rather than theoria. Another theologian's reported characterization of analogia entis goes as far as claiming ""The analogy of being refers to the fact that there is a relation between the created and the uncreated being; that God created the world from archetypes and that man’s salvation rests on the return of his soul to the uncreated world of ideas.""


=== Protestant treatments ===
Analogia entis was not an issue in Reformation theology and not considered a rival to special revelation. For Martin Luther, reason ""knows that there is a God, but it does not know who or which is the true God."" Calvinists have stressed the correct limits of ideas such as analogia entis.
According to theologian Ry Siggelkow, ""It is now widely acknowledged that the numerous debates that have ensued around the analogia entis have been remarkably confused.""
Some Protestant detractors take the analogia entis as meaning that unsaved humans can reach a saving knowledge of God outside grace, revelation, faith, etc, but merely by autonomous insight. For example, theologian Paul Brazier claims analogia entis is, or comes down to, ""the  idea  that  we  can  know  and understand God soundly, securely, primarily, through analogy in  God's  creation.""
Some Protestant commentators connect the analogia entis to ideas of the Trinitarian Vestages mentioned by St Thomas Aquinas, and Thomistic ideas that an effect resembles its cause, therefore being a form of natural theology, unacceptable to e.g. Calvinists but acceptable to other theology.
Among attempts to reconcile analoga entis with an analogia fidei are theologian K. Sura's comment that ""analogy from the perspective of God is an analogy of being, analogy from the perspective of man is an analogy of faith."": 420 


==== Karl Barth ====
Karl Barth, a 20th century German protestant dogmatic theologian who was a friend of Erich Przywara and Hans Urs von Balthasar, notoriously asserted at one stage that the analogia entis was the only thing that prevented him becoming Catholic, and the invention of the anti-Christ.
Barth's views may have altered radically over his life: Protestant theologian Ry Siggelkow puts it ""In contrast to Barth's early critique, which interpreted the doctrine as emphasizing an ontological similarity between God's being and creaturely being, the later Barth, according to Jüngel, feared that the so-called analogia entis would not do justice to the difference between God and man by overlooking the nearness of God."": 61 
The early critique: using Aquinas' teachings that grace does not destroy but supports and perfects nature (Latin: gratia non destruit se supponit et perficit naturam), and that the analogia entis means humans participate in a similarity to God ( similitudo Dei); Barth reasoned that consequently if the experience of God is always a possibility, the analogia entis circumvents the need for grace. Barth regarded it as a kind of natural theology and therefore counter to salvation by grace and scriptural revelation of the new covenant only (and particularly imprudent in Nazi Germany as potentially reinforcing their nature-worship mythologies.) God alone provides knowledge, nothing comes from a consideration of natural things.
Catholic writers tend to view Barth's early objections as, to some extent, based on a caricature  or extra baggage  Fr. Przywara stressed ""analogia entis in no way signifies a 'natural theology'"" 
Barth conditionally withdrew his objection ""as the invention of the anti-Christ"" for a version of analogia entis couched as God making himself known (as espoused by Gottlieb Söhngen student of Przywara and teacher of Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI.) Barth proposed what he called analogia relationalis then analogia fidei in response, including the idea that the only thing that God can be analogized from is Jesus and his humanity. ""If analogia entis is interpreted as analogy of relation or analogy of faith, I will no longer say nasty things (about it)""


==== Eberhard Jüngel ====
Lutheran theologian Eberhard Jüngel has claimed the common Protestant objections (following from the early Barth view) tend to ""miss the point of the so-called analogia entis entirely."": 67 
However, Jüngel ultimately rejects analogia entis as making God unapproachably distant. He developed an ""analogy of advent"" based on God approaching humans.: 71 


==== Rowan Williams ====
For Welsh theologian Rowan Williams, the analogia entis is the proposition that ""there is no system of which God and creatures are both part."": 66 


=== Islamic theology ===
According to theologian Joshua Ralston, medieval Sunni theologian Abu Hamid al-Ghazali's Al-Maqsad al-Asna (The 99 Beautiful Names of God) rejects analogia entis: ""to speak rightly about God is emphatically to speak ""after revelation""—so analogy and reason may be used, but only in light of what God has first revealed (in the Qur'an).""

Animation database,"An animation database is a database which stores fragments of animations or human movements and which can be accessed, analyzed and queried to develop and assemble new animations. Given that the manual generation of a large amount of animation can be time consuming and expensive, an animation database can assist users in building animations by using existing components, and sharing animation fragments.
Early examples of animation databases include the system MOVE which used an object oriented database. Modern animation databases can be populated via the extraction of skeletal animations from motion capture data.
Other examples include crowd simulation in which a number of people are simulated as a crowd. Given that in some applications the people need to be walking at different speeds, say on a sidewalk, the animation database can be used to retrieve and merge different animated figures. The method is mainly known as ""motion graphs"".
Animation databases can also be used for ""interactive storytelling"" in which fragments of animations are retrieved from the animation database and are recycled to combine into new stories. For instance, the animation database called Animebase is used within the system Words Anime to help generate animations using recycled components. In this approach, the user may input words which form parts of a story and queries against the database help select suitable animation fragments. This type of system may indeed use two databases: an animation database, as well as a story knowledge database. The story knowledge database may use subjects, predicates and objects to refer to story fragments. The system then assists the user in matching between story fragments and animation fragments.
Animation databases can also be used for the generation of visual scenes using humanoid models. An example application has been the development of an animated humanoid-based sign language system to help the disabled.
Another application of an animation database is in the synthesis of idle motion for human characters. Human beings move all the time and in unique ways, and the presentation of a consistent and realistic set of idle motions for each character between different animation segments has been a challenge, e.g. each person has a unique way of standing and this needs to be represented in a realistic way throughout an animation. One of the problems is that idle motion affects all joints and simply showing statistical movements at each joint results in less than realistic portrayals. One approach to solving this problem is to use an animation database with a large set of pre-recorded human movements, and obtain the suitable patterns of motion from the database through statistical analysis.

Stubble burning,"Stubble burning is the practice of intentionally setting fire to the straw stubble that remains after grains, such as rice and wheat, have been harvested. The technique is still widespread today.
Stubble burning has been associated with increasing greenhouse gases over the past few decades fueling climate change due to the particulate matter contamination it distributes into the atmosphere.


== Effects ==

The burning of stubble has both positive and negative consequences.


=== Generally helpful effects ===
Cheaper and easier than other removal methods
Helps to combat pests and weeds
Can reduce nitrogen tie-up


=== Generally harmful effects ===
Loss of nutrients.
Pollution from smoke. Including greenhouse gases and others that damage the ozone layer.
Damage to electrical and electronic equipment from floating threads of conductive waste.
Risk of fires spreading out of control.
Additionally, prolonged stubble burning kills beneficial microflora and fauna in soil which reduces organic matter and destroys the carbon-nitrogen equilibrium.


=== Health concerns related to stubble burning in India ===
A wide array of health disorders are associated with the stubble burning emission releases which have caused people to develop lung cancer and respiratory infections. The emissions also threaten the health of children who tend to have weaker organs. Not only that but the smog from the stubble burning also severely affects people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder as it worsens their health conditions. India also has the highest number of blind people in the world and if the smog gets in your eyes you are more likely to develop cataracts. Additionally, people who have been exposed to smog can develop eye irritation, eye-watering, and conjunctival hyperemia symptoms. In order to reduce pollution there needs to be severe attention to the issue involved with effective sustainable management practices enforced by the government. The Indian government has been receiving intense backlash for not reacting quickly enough to the health emergency, especially amongst the green revolution that is bringing attention to climate change concerns.


=== Alternative to stubble burning ===
The solutions to reduce the pollution from stubble burning involve mitigating crop farming, adhering to diversification of agriculture, adopting the paddy straw farming technique, and making biomass pellets.
Agriculture residues can have other uses, such as in particle board and biofuel, though these uses can still cause problems like erosion and nutrient loss.
Spraying an enzyme, which decomposes the stubble into useful fertiliser, improves the soil, avoids air pollution and prevents carbon dioxide emissions.
Several companies worldwide use leftover agricultural waste to make new products. Agricultural waste can serve as raw materials for new applications, such as paper and board, bio-based oils, leather, catering disposables, fuel and plastic. Another important way to manage the agricultural waste from stubble burning would be to detoxify the soil after it has been burned and using aerobic and anaerobic techniques that recycle organic matter.


=== Empowering farmers to use sustainable solutions ===
Another way to reduce particulate matter pollution entails the requirement of bringing severe attention to the issue in accordance with effective sustainable management practices and government support. Active stakeholder acknowledgment by the farm owners that are producing the products that are used in stubble burning will need to form agreements with the government too. Unfortunately, many of the farmers that contribute to the pollution are unaware of the implications of how harmful stubble burning is for the earth especially as to how it depletes soil of nutrients and contaminates the air. Empowering farmers and educating them about the harmful consequences that stubble burning causes to the atmosphere is also necessary for stubble burning pollution reduction.


== Attitudes toward stubble burning ==
Stubble burning has been effectively prohibited since 1993 in the United Kingdom. A perceived increase in blackgrass, and particularly herbicide resistant blackgrass, has led to a campaign by some arable farmers for its return.
In Australia stubble burning is ""not the preferred option for the majority of farmers"" but is permitted and recommended in some circumstances. Farmers are advised to rake and burn windrows, and leave a fire break of 3 metres around any burn off.
In the United States, fires are fairly common in mid-western states, but some states such as Oregon and Idaho regulate the practice.
In the European Union, the Common Agricultural Policy strongly discourages stubble burning.
In China, there is a government ban on stubble burning; however the practice remains fairly common.
In northern India, despite a ban by the Punjab Pollution Control Board, stubble burning is still practiced since the 1980s. Authorities are starting to enforce this ban more proactively, and to research alternatives.
Stubble burning is allowed by permit in some Canadian provinces, including Manitoba where 5% of farmers were estimated to do it in 2007.


=== India ===

Stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh in north India has been cited as a major cause of air pollution in Delhi since 1980. Consequently, the government is considering implementation of the 1,600 km long and 5 km wide Great Green Wall of Aravalli. The smog that arises from the burning contributes fine black and brown carbon into the atmosphere which affects light absorption. As the weather is cooler in November in India, the stubble burning generates a thick haze of fog, dust, and industrial pollution. From April to May and October to November each year, farmers mainly in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh burn an estimated 35 million tons of crop waste from their wheat and paddy fields after harvesting as a low-cost straw-disposal practice to reduce the turnaround time between harvesting and sowing for the first (summer) crop and the second (winter) crop. Smoke from this burning produces a cloud of particulates visible from space and has produced what has been described as a ""toxic cloud"" in New Delhi, resulting in declarations of an air-pollution emergency. For this, the NGT (National Green Tribunal) instituted a fine of ₹2 lakh on the Delhi Government for failing to file an action plan providing incentives and infrastructural assistance to farmers to stop them from burning crop residue to prevent air pollution.
Although harvesters such as the Indian-manufactured ""Happy Seeder"" that shred the crop residues into small pieces and uniformly spread them across the field are available as an alternative to burning stubble, and crops such as millets and maize can be grown as a sustainable alternative to rice and wheat in order to conserve water, some farmers complain that the cost of these machines is a significant financial burden, with the crops not incurred under MSP prices when compared to burning the fields and purchasing crops that are produced under MSP prices.
The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, developed an enzyme bio-decomposer solution, that can be sprayed after the harvest, to increase organic carbon in the soil and maintain overall soil health. In 2021, they began licensing its use to various companies.
In May 2022, the Government of Punjab announced they will purchase maize, bajra, sunflower and moong crops at MSP, encouraging farmers to adopt less water consuming options as a sustainable alternative to paddy and wheat in the wake of fast-depleting groundwater.


=== The pollution from stubble burning in India ===
A recent study in 2020 showed that the country created 600-700 million tonnes of crop residue and is choking cities. People in India are awaiting sustainable management to reduce the pollution. The areas that are largely contributing to the stubble burning pollutants are Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana which is spreading to the border of Uttarakhand. The unsustainable use of alternating wheat-rice cropping patterns is exhausting natural resources like water, soil, and forest areas. In one year the emissions from the crop burning can be 17 times the total annual particulate pollution and the crop residue carbon dioxide submissions are 64 times the element emissions in Delhi. The crops that are typically burned include rice, wheat, maize, millet, and sugarcane, all of which have large investment returns and also leave a residue on the field after being cut. After 1 tonne of crop residue is burnt in a field there is a release of 1,400 kg of carbon dioxide, 58 kg of cobalt, 11 kg of particulate matter, 4.9 kg of nitrogen oxides, and 1.2 kg of sulfur dioxide. Stubble burning also depletes groundwater and the lack of attention to the issue has led Indian civilians to feel hopeless for effective government interventional responses.

Cataphatic theology,"Cataphatic theology or kataphatic theology is theology that uses ""positive"" terminology to describe or refer to the divine – specifically, God – i.e. terminology that describes or refers to what the divine is believed to be, in contrast to the ""negative"" terminology used in apophatic theology to indicate what it is believed the divine is not.


== Etymology ==
""Cataphatic"" comes from the Greek word κατάφασις kataphasis meaning ""affirmation,"" coming from κατά kata (an intensifier) and φάναι phanai (""to speak"").


== Terminology ==

To speak of God or the divine cataphatically is thought by some to be by its nature a form of limiting to God or divine. This was one of the core tenets of the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, who said of God, ""Neither is there sense, nor image, nor opinion, nor reason, nor knowledge of Him."" By defining what God or the divine is we limit the unlimited. As Saint Augustine wrote, similarly, ""if you can grasp [God], it isn’t God."" A cataphatic way to express God would be that God is love. The apophatic way would be to state that God is not hate (although such description can be accused of the same dualism). Or to say that God is not love, as he transcends even our notion of love. Ultimately, one would come to remove even the notion of the Trinity, or of saying that God is one, because divine is above numberhood. That God is beyond all duality because God contains within himself all things and that God is beyond all things. Saint Dionysus taught the apophatic way, which involves stripping away any conceptual understanding of God that might become all-encompassing. This approach prevents the limited nature of human understanding from imposing itself on the absolute and divine.


== Eastern Orthodoxy ==
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, kataphatic theology can lead to some knowledge of God, but in an imperfect way. The perfect and only way which is fitting in regard of God is the apophatic way, as the kataphatic way has as its object that which exists, but God is beyond all existing.


== Roman Catholicism ==
The Life of Moses - Gregory of Nyssa
St. Augustine
Anselm of Canterbury


== Cataphatic treatment of ultimate reality in Buddhism ==
Within Mahayana Buddhism, there is a species of scripture which essays a descriptive hint of Ultimate Reality by using positive terminology when speaking of it. This manifestation of Buddhism is particularly marked in the Dzogchen and Tathagatagarbha forms of the religion. Nirvana, for example, is equated with the True Self of the Buddha (pure, uncreated and deathless) in some of the Tathagatagarbha scriptures, and in other Buddhist tantras (such as the Kunjed Gyalpo or 'All-Creating King' tantra), the Primordial Buddha, Samantabhadra, is described as 'pure and total consciousness' – the 'trunk', 'foundation' and 'root' of all that exists.


== In Gaudiya-vaishnavism ==
Gaudiya Vaishnavism speaks positively about transcendental qualities of Krishna. He has 64 transcendental qualities as Supreme Personality of Godhead, although these qualities are explained as non-material and beyond duality. The paradoxical nature of Krishna, the Absolute, being both beyond description and having qualities is discussed throughout the Gaudiya Vaishnavism literature. Among the 64 qualities of Krishna, 4 qualities are unique, which only Krishna has, these are:

He is the performer of wonderful varieties of pastimes (especially His childhood pastimes).
He is surrounded by devotees endowed with wonderful love of Godhead.
He can attract all living entities all over the universes by playing on His flute.
He has a wonderful excellence of beauty which cannot be rivaled anywhere in the creation.
There are other 60 qualities of Krishna, but Narayana also have them. Of these, 5 are special, which are not found in jiva-atmas or (according to the Vaishnava view) other Hindu deities, even Brahma or Shiva:

He has inconceivable potency.
Uncountable universes generate from His body.
He is the original source of all incarnations.
He is the giver of salvation to the enemies whom He kills.
He is the attractor of liberated souls.
Other 55 transcendental qualities are found in Brahma and Shiva, though they are common for Narayana and Krishna, but not found in jiva-atmas. And finally just 50 transcendental qualities can be found in jiva-atmas, who are not on the level of deities, but Krishna and Narayana also have these qualities. It also has to be carefully noted, that these qualities manifest in jiva-atmas only in minute qualities, and only if they become pure devotees of Krishna-Caitanya. On other hand, Krishna has these 64 qualities in full. See full list here: 64 Qualities of Lord Krishna.

Service account,"A service account or application account is a digital identity used by an application software or service to interact with other applications or the operating system. They are often used for machine to machine communication (M2M), for example for application programming interfaces (API). The service account may be a privileged identity within the context of the application.


== Updating passwords ==
Local service accounts can interact with various components of the operating system, which makes coordination of password changes difficult. In practice this causes passwords for service accounts to rarely be changed, which poses a considerable security risk for an organization.
Some types of service accounts do not have a password.


== Wide access ==
Service accounts are often used by applications for access to databases, running batch jobs or scripts, or for accessing other applications. Such privileged identities often have extensive access to an organization's underlying data stores laying in applications or databases.
Passwords for such accounts are often built and saved in plain textfiles, which is a vulnerability which may be replicated across several servers to provide fault tolerance for applications. This vulnerability poses a significant risk for an organization since the application often hosts the type of data which is interesting to advanced persistent threats.
Service accounts are non-personal digital identities and can be shared.


== Misuse ==
Google Cloud lists several possibilities for misuse of service accounts:

Privilege escalation: Someone impersonates the service account
Spoofing: Someone impersonates the service account to hide their identity
Non-repudiation: Performing actions on their behalf with a service account in cases where it is not possible to trace the actions of the abuser
Information disclosure: Unauthorized persons extract information about infrastructure, applications or processes

History of theology,"The history of theology has manifestations in many different cultures and religious traditions.


== Terminology and connotations ==

Plato used the Greek word theologia (θεολογία) with the meaning ""discourse on god"" around 380 BCE in Republic, Book ii, Ch. 18 (379a). 
The Latin author Boethius, writing in the early 6th century, used theologia to denote a subdivision of philosophy as a subject of academic study, dealing with the motionless, incorporeal reality (as opposed to physica, which deals with corporeal, moving realities). Boethius' definition influenced medieval Latin usage.
It is in this last sense - theology as an academic discipline involving the basis of rational study of Christian teaching - that the term passed into English in the fourteenth century.
From the 17th century onwards, it also became possible to use the term ""theology"" to refer to study of religious ideas and teachings that are not specifically Christian (e.g., in the term natural theology which denoted theology based on reasoning from natural facts independent of specifically Christian revelation).
""Theology"" can also now be used in a derived sense to mean ""a system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid) ideology"".


== Theological development ==


=== Indian theology ===

The earliest theological reflections in Hinduism are found in the Rg Veda, the oldest sacred text. Here, an abstract Supreme Being is acknowledged as self-originating and the source of all phenomena. Vedic gods, including Indra, Varuna, and Vishnu, share common characteristics. They are said to have created the universe, set the sun in the sky, and propped apart heaven and earth. These gods are susceptible to human praise, and their personifications vary.
Hindu theology embraces panentheism, believing that the Supreme Soul (Parmatma) both transcends and pervades the universe. This underlying principle unifies the diverse pantheon of gods and goddesses. While Hinduism appears polytheistic due to its many deities, it is essentially monotheistic, recognising the unity of the divine.
The Bhakti movement (medieval period) emphasized intense devotion to a personal deity. Bhakti theologians like Ramanuja, Madhva, and Chaitanya advocated for loving surrender to God. Devotional texts, such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana, shaped theological thought by emphasizing devotion, ethics, and the pursuit of moksha (liberation).
Shankara, the founder of Advaita Vedanta, expounded non-dualism (advaita) by asserting that the individual soul (jivatman) is identical to the Supreme Soul (Brahman). This philosophical theology influenced Hindu thought, emphasizing self-realization and the illusory nature of the material world.
In contemporary Hinduism, theologians engage with issues like social justice, environmental ethics, and interfaith dialogue. Theological reflection continues to evolve, drawing from ancient texts, philosophical traditions, and the lived experiences of practitioners.


=== Christian theology ===

Christian theology, in scholastics of the Middle Age regarded as ""the queen of sciences"".
The 16th-century Protestant reformation, in the spirit of Renaissance humanism, paid great attention to the study of biblical text, accompanied by outbursts of popular theology in personal religious fervor.
Recent Christian theological movements include Liberation theology, liberal theology, and fundamentalism.


=== Islamic theology ===

From the late 19th century onward, Islamic theology adapted to changing contexts. Scholars in Arab countries, Turkey, Iran, India, Central Asia, and Indonesia, explored diverse theological perspectives. Modern theologians grappled with issues like secularism, pluralism, and the compatibility of Islamic teachings with contemporary life.

Wood,"Wood is the main substance in trees. It is mainly formed by the xylem vessels which carry water up the plant. The two main substances in wood are cellulose and lignin. Wood is used to make buildings and furniture, and also for art. Firewood is a fuel. Paper is made from wood fibres. Wood is a renewable resource although it has become scarcer in recent centuries. Its origin is about 425 million years ago.
Wood is hard to cut, but it is also strong. A lumberjack is a person who cuts down trees. After a tree falls, the wood in it can be cut into long, straight pieces called lumber. Lumber can then be used to make posts, or put together with nails, screws, or even glue to make wooden frames for other shapes.
Wood comes in many different kinds. Oak, maple (hardwood) and pine and redwood (softwood) are widely used types of wood. Woods are usually divided into softwood (from conifers) and hardwood from flowering plants.


== Housing ==
For a long time and even today, many buildings, mostly houses, have been made of wood. To build a house with wood, lumber is put together into frames that are the shape of each wall, floor, and roof of the house. Then the frames are placed into the shape of a house. Then the frames can be covered to make solid walls. Sometimes the walls are made of more wood.
When the outside of a house or building is covered in wood, the wooden pieces are usually flat and stacked. These pieces are called shingles. Wood is also sometimes used in other parts of the house, like doors and staircases. Wood is also used to make fences.


== Carpentry ==

Carpenters make houses of mostly soft wood such as pine. For many kinds of furniture they use harder wood such as maple or oak. When someone builds something with wood, they often paint it. Paint protects and beautifies the wood. Some people like the look of wood, so they put clear paint called varnish on it. This helps to protect the wood and gives it a shiny finish.
Some people make art with wood. Sometimes sculptures are built with wood: see Grinling Gibbons.
Regular pencils are made of wood. Inside is the ""lead"", which is not actually lead. Clay or wax and graphite form the ""lead"" in a pencil.


== Paper ==
Wood is turned into paper in large factories called paper mills.  Heat, chemicals and machines separate the cellulose fibers from other parts and press the fibers into paper.

Wood stabilization,"Wood stabilization is a series of processes which use pressure and/or vacuum to impregnate wood cellular structure with certain monomers, acrylics, phenolics or other resins to improve dimensional stability, biological durability, hardness, and other material properties. When exposed to moisture through humidity absorption or direct immersion, most wood species will swell and change shape. When moisture comes into contact with wood, the water molecules penetrate the cell wall and become bound to cell wall components through hydrogen bonding. With addition of water to the cell wall, wood volume increases nearly proportionally to the volume of water added. Swelling increases until the fiber saturation point has been reached. Wood stabilization limits water absorption into the wood structure, thereby limiting the dimensional changes which arise from moisture exposure.
Wood stabilization is a subset of wood preservation processes specifically used by woodworking enthusiasts to alter the material properties of specific wood species for applications within their craft or trade.  Examples of wood items which are commonly stabilized include knife handles, pistol grips, straight razors, game calls and jewelry. One of the most commonly used stabilizing methods utilizes a heat cured polymer known as  methyl methacrylate (MMA).


== Material properties ==
Material properties of stabilized wood varies by specific species and type of stabilization process used, however in softwoods and soft hardwoods, the improvement in strength, hardness and durability can be dramatic. For example, Poplar treated with MMA increased specimen density by 2.2 to 2.6 times with gains in hardness of approximately twofold (using the Janka Hardness Test).

Register (art),"In art and archaeology, sculpture and painting, a register is a horizontal level in a work that consists of several levels arranged one above the other, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines.  Modern comic books typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, ""register"" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in cylinder seals, which often mix text and images.  Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically.  
The use of registers is common in Ancient Egyptian art, from the Narmer Palette onwards, and in medieval art in large frescos and illuminated manuscripts.  Narrative art, especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers.  
Sculpted Luwian language hieroglyphs were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row. Other examples, in the art of Mesopotamia, are Kudurru, or boundary stones, which often had registers of gods on the upper registers of the scenes.

Orbital revolution,"Orbital revolution is the movement of a planet around a star, or a moon around a planet. For example, the Earth revolves around the Sun, and the Moon revolves about the Earth.
Planets and moons revolve in elliptical orbits. One orbital revolution of a planet takes one year, while a revolution of the Moon takes a month.
Astronomers usually use different words for the orbit of a planet around a star, and for the spin of a planet about its own axis. If an item is in orbit, it is ""revolving"", while the spin of a planet is called ""rotating"". The amount of time it takes for an object to revolve around the Sun is a year, and the amount of time it takes to revolve around its axis is one day. According to the Gregorian calendar, a year on Earth is equal to 365 days, with an extra day added every four years.
The amount of time it takes for an object to move around the sun is different for every object. For example, it takes the planet Mercury about 88 days to revolve around the sun, but it takes the dwarf planet Pluto over 248 years to revolve around the sun.",0
Volcanic winter,"A volcanic winter is a climate cooling caused by an extremely large volcanic eruption. Such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities. They form aerosols of sulfuric acid. When they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected, and some is absorbed by the stratosphere. These reactions heat up the stratosphere, but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground.
The Siberian Traps, Emeishan Traps, and Deccan Traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism. They are the cause, or part of the cause, of several mass extinctions, especially the Permian–Triassic extinction event.
Nuclear winter is a theory of similar effects which might be caused by a large-scale nuclear war.


== Recent events ==

The effects of recent volcanic eruptions on winters are modest in scale but historically their effects have been significant.
Most recently, the 1991 explosion of Mount Pinatubo, a stratovolcano in the Philippines, cooled global temperatures for about 2–3 years.
In 1883, the explosion of Krakatoa (Krakatau) created volcanic winter-like conditions. The next four years after the explosion were unusually cold, and the winter of 1887 to 1888 included powerful blizzards. Record snowfalls were recorded worldwide.
The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, a stratovolcano in Indonesia, occasioned mid-summer frosts in New York State and June snowfalls in New England and Newfoundland and Labrador in what came to be known as the ""Year without a Summer"" of 1816.
A paper written by Benjamin Franklin in the 1780s blamed the unusually cool summer of 1783 on volcanic dust coming from Iceland. The eruption of Laki volcano had released enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide, resulting in the death of much of the island's livestock and a catastrophic famine which killed a quarter of the population. Temperatures in the northern hemisphere dropped by about 1 °C in the year following the Laki eruption.
In 1600, the Huaynaputina in Peru erupted. Tree ring studies show that 1601 was cold. Russia had its worst famine in 1601 to 1603. From 1600 to 1602, Switzerland, Latvia and Estonia had exceptionally cold winters. The wine harvest was late in 1601 in France, and in Peru and Germany wine production collapsed. Peach trees bloomed late in China, and Lake Suwa in Japan froze early.
In 1452 or 1453, a cataclysmic eruption of the submarine volcano named Kuwae.  It caused worldwide disruptions.
The Great Famine of 1315–1317 in Europe may have been caused by a volcanic event. That of Kaharoa, New Zealand, had lasted about five years.

Flame,"A flame (from Latin  flamma) is the visible, gaseous part of a fire. It is caused by a highly exothermic chemical reaction made in a thin zone. When flames are hot enough to have ionized gaseous components of sufficient density, they are then considered plasma.


== Mechanism ==

Color and temperature of a flame are dependent on the type of fuel involved in the combustion. For example, when a lighter is held to a candle, the applied heat causes the fuel molecules in the candle wax to vaporize. In this state they can then readily react with oxygen in the air, which gives off enough heat in the subsequent exothermic reaction to vaporize yet more fuel, thus sustaining a consistent flame. The high temperature of the flame causes the vaporized fuel molecules to decompose, forming various incomplete combustion products and free radicals, and these products then react with each other and with the oxidizer involved in the reaction of the following flame (fire).
One may investigate different parts of a candle flame with the aid of a cold metal spoon: the higher parts of the flame produce water vapor deposition, the result of combustion, the yellow parts in the middle produce soot, and the area near the candle wick produces unburned wax. Goldsmiths use higher parts of a flame with a metallic blow-pipe for melting gold and silver. Sufficient energy in the flame will excite the electrons in some of the transient reaction intermediates such as the methylidyne radical (CH) and diatomic carbon (C2), which results in the emission of visible light as these substances release their excess energy (see spectrum below for an explanation of which specific radical species produce which specific colors). As the combustion temperature of a flame increases (if the flame contains small particles of unburnt carbon or other material), so does the average energy of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the flame (see Black body).
Other oxidizers besides oxygen can be used to produce a flame. Hydrogen burning in chlorine produces a flame and in the process emits gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) as the combustion product. Another of many possible chemical combinations is hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which is hypergolic and commonly used in rocket engines. Fluoropolymers can be used to supply fluorine as an oxidizer of metallic fuels, e.g. in the magnesium/teflon/viton composition.
The chemical kinetics occurring in the flame are very complex and typically involve a large number of chemical reactions and intermediate species, most of them radicals. For instance, a well-known chemical kinetics scheme, GRI-Mech, uses 53 species and 325 elementary reactions to describe combustion of biogas.
There are different methods of distributing the required components of combustion to a flame. In a diffusion flame, oxygen and fuel diffuse into each other; the flame occurs where they meet. In a premixed flame, the oxygen and fuel are premixed beforehand, which results in a different type of flame. Candle flames (a diffusion flame) operate through evaporation of the fuel which rises in a laminar flow of hot gas which then mixes with surrounding oxygen and combusts.


== Color ==

Flame color depends on several factors, the most important typically being black-body radiation and spectral band emission, with both spectral line emission and spectral line absorption playing smaller roles. In the most common type of flame, hydrocarbon flames, the most important factor determining color is oxygen supply and the extent of fuel-oxygen pre-mixing, which determines the rate of combustion and thus the temperature and reaction paths, thereby producing different color hues.

In a laboratory under normal gravity conditions and with a closed air inlet, a Bunsen burner burns with yellow flame (also called a safety flame) with a peak temperature of about 2,000 K (3,100 °F). The yellow arises from incandescence of very fine soot particles that are produced in the flame. Also, carbon monoxide is produced, and the flame tends to take oxygen from the surfaces it touches. When the air inlet is opened, less soot and carbon monoxide are produced. When enough air is supplied, no soot or carbon monoxide is produced and the flame becomes blue. (Most of this blue had previously been obscured by the bright yellow emissions.) The spectrum of a premixed (complete combustion) butane flame on the right shows that the blue color arises specifically due to emission of excited molecular radicals in the flame, which emit most of their light well below ≈565 nanometers in the blue and green regions of the visible spectrum.
The colder part of a diffusion (incomplete combustion) flame will be red, transitioning to orange, yellow, and white as the temperature increases as evidenced by changes in the black-body radiation spectrum. For a given flame's region, the closer to white on this scale, the hotter that section of the flame is. The transitions are often apparent in fires, in which the color emitted closest to the fuel is white, with an orange section above it, and reddish flames the highest of all. A blue-colored flame only emerges when the amount of soot decreases and the blue emissions from excited molecular radicals become dominant, though the blue can often be seen near the base of candles where airborne soot is less concentrated.
Specific colors can be imparted to the flame by introduction of excitable species with bright emission spectrum lines. In analytical chemistry, this effect is used in flame tests (or flame emission spectroscopy) to determine presence of some metal ions. In pyrotechnics, the pyrotechnic colorants are used to produce brightly colored fireworks.


== Temperature ==

When looking at a flame's temperature there are many factors which can change or apply. An important one is that a flame's color does not necessarily determine a temperature comparison because black-body radiation is not the only thing that produces or determines the color seen; therefore it is only an estimation of temperature. Other factors that determine its temperature are:

In fires (particularly house fires), the cooler flames are often red and produce the most smoke. Here the red color compared to typical yellow color of the flames suggests that the temperature is lower. This is because there is a lack of oxygen in the room and therefore there is incomplete combustion and the flame temperature is low, often just 600 to 850 °C (1,112 to 1,562 °F). This means that a lot of carbon monoxide is formed (which is a flammable gas) which is when there is greatest risk of backdraft. When this occurs, combustible gases at or above the flash point of spontaneous combustion are exposed to oxygen, carbon monoxide and superheated hydrocarbons combust, and temporary temperatures of up to 2,000 °C (3,630 °F) occur.


=== Common flame temperatures ===

This is a rough guide to flame temperatures for various common substances (in 20 °C (68 °F) air at 1 atm. pressure):


=== Highest temperature ===
Dicyanoacetylene, a compound of carbon and nitrogen with chemical formula C4N2 burns in oxygen with a bright blue-white flame at a temperature of 5,260 K (4,990 °C; 9,010 °F), and at up to 6,000 K (5,730 °C; 10,340 °F) in ozone. This high flame temperature is partially due to the absence of hydrogen in the fuel (dicyanoacetylene is not a hydrocarbon) thus there is no water among the combustion products.
Cyanogen, with the formula (CN)2, produces the second-hottest-known natural flame with a temperature of over 4,525 °C (8,177 °F) when it burns in oxygen.


=== Cool flames ===

At temperatures as low as 120 °C (248 °F), fuel-air mixtures can react chemically and produce very weak flames called cool flames. The phenomenon was discovered by Humphry Davy in 1817. The process depends on a fine balance of temperature and concentration of the reacting mixture, and if conditions are right it can initiate without any external ignition source. Cyclical variations in the balance of chemicals, particularly of intermediate products in the reaction, give oscillations in the flame, with a typical temperature variation of about 100 °C (212 °F), or between ""cool"" and full ignition. Sometimes the variation can lead to an explosion.


== In microgravity ==

In the year 2000, experiments by NASA confirmed that gravity plays an indirect role in flame formation and composition. The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a flame (such as in a candle in normal gravity conditions), making it yellow. In microgravity or zero gravity environment, such as in orbit, natural convection no longer occurs and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become bluer and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is the hypothesis that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than do diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and private industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.


== Thermonuclear flames ==
Flames do not need to be driven only by chemical energy release. In stars, subsonic burning fronts driven by burning light nuclei (like carbon or helium) to heavy nuclei (up to iron group) propagate as flames. This is important in some models of Type Ia supernovae. In thermonuclear flames, thermal conduction dominates over species diffusion, so the flame speed and thickness is determined by the thermonuclear energy release and thermal conductivity (often in the form of degenerate electrons).

Off-model,"Off-model is a term used in the animation and visual arts industries to describe art that does not match the style, design, or proportions that have been previously established for a given project (i.e. any work that is not on-model). Any kind of visual art can be off-model, so long as it defies the conventions of an established design. Consequently, art can be made off-model accidentally, due to skill or time constraints that may limit an artist's ability to accurately replicate a style. However, off-model can also be an intentional choice on the part of an animator. John Kricfalusi has argued that off-model animation allows originality and can help a scene come to life, as strictly sticking to poses and expressions as dictated in model sheets can be too restricting.
Off-model art is often associated with 2D animation, such as cartoons and anime. For much of the history of 2D animation, individual frames have been hand-drawn in sequence. This task may be outsourced to multiple individuals or studios, increasing the chances for the miscommunication of character, environment, or item design. Animation studios attempt to limit this issue by distributing model sheets amongst animators, which may include poses or expressions for artist reference.
Off-model work may also be the product of artists or cartoonists intending to parody another franchise but not wishing to incur a lawsuit or commit copyright infringement by drawing someone else's trademarked characters.

Electronic money,"Electronic money is money stored electronically, and spent by using a technical device, such as a smart card.  If it is stored on a card, its use may be secured by a PIN code.  In Japan, electronic money is commonly used to pay for train tickets.  JR East’s prepaid train ticket (Suica) and JR West’s IC Operating card (ICOCA).  Suica and ICOCA are plastic cards with a built-in IC chip.  Suica was originally introduced in 2001.
In addition, many types of electronic money are used in other train stations in Japan.  For example, Kitaca is electronic money in the Hokkaido area, Sugoca is used in the Kyusyu area, etc.  Most electronic money is also used to pay for goods at convenience stores in Japan.  In 2004, NTT DoCoMo launched a mobile phone that uses smart card chip to realize electronic money capability.  Many people have used these kinds of electronic money cards in Japan.
Note:  electronic money is always backed by real money. For this reason, cryptocurrencies cannot be used as electronic money.
In the European Union, authorized and regulated electronic money institutions can issue e-money which serves as a ""digital alternative to cash"". The issuing e-money is governed by the Directive 2009/110/EC ""on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions"". The Directive also describes e-money as a ""technically neutral ... electronic surrogate for coins and banknotes"". 
In June of 2019, the Icelandic company Monerium become the first company authorized to issue e-money tokens on blockchains.

Hardstone carving,"Hardstone carving, in art history and archaeology, is the artistic carving of semi-precious stones (and sometimes gemstones), such as jade, rock crystal (clear quartz), agate, onyx, jasper, serpentinite, or carnelian, and for objects made in this way. Normally the objects are small, and the category overlaps with both jewellery and sculpture. Hardstone carving is sometimes referred to by the Italian term pietre dure; however, pietra dura (with an ""a"") is the common term used for stone inlay work, which causes some confusion.
From the Neolithic period until about the 19th century such objects were among the most highly prized in a wide variety of cultures, often attributed special powers or religious significance, but today coverage in non-specialist art history tends to be relegated to a catch-all decorative arts or ""minor arts"" category. The types of objects carved have included those with ritual or religious purposes, engraved gems as signet rings and other kinds of seal, handles, belt hooks and similar items, vessels and purely decorative objects.


== Scope of the term ==

Hardstone carving falls under the general category of glyptic art, which covers small carvings and sculpture in all categories of stone. The definition in this context of ""hardstone"" is unscientific and not very rigid, but excludes ""soft"" stones such as soapstone (steatite) and minerals such as alabaster, both widely used for carving, as well as typical stones for building and monumental sculpture, such as marble and other types of limestone, and sandstone. These are typically not capable of a fine finish in very small carvings, and would wear in prolonged use. In other contexts, such as architecture, ""hard stone"" and ""soft stone"" have different meanings, referring to actual measured hardness using the Mohs scale of mineral hardness and other measures. Some rocks used in architecture and monumental sculpture, such as granite, are at least as hard as the gemstones, and others such as malachite are relatively soft but counted as hardstones because of their rarity and fine colour.
Essentially, any stone that is often used in jewellery is likely to count as a hardstone. Hard organic minerals such as amber and jet are included, as well as the mineraloid obsidian. Hardstones normally have to be drilled rather than worked with edged tools to achieve a fine finish. Geologically speaking, most of the gemstones traditionally carved in the West are varieties of quartz, including: chalcedony, agate, amethyst, sard, onyx, carnelian, heliotrope, jasper, and quartz in its uncoloured and transparent form, known as rock crystal. The various materials called jade have been dominant in East Asian and Mesoamerican carving. Stones typically used for buildings and large sculpture are not often used for small objects such as vessels, although this does occur. For example, in the Uruk period of Sumerian culture (4th millennium BCE) heavy vases, cups and ewers of sandstone and limestone have been found, but were not for common use, as the people of Uruk had well-developed pottery.


== History ==


=== Asia and the Islamic world ===

The art is very ancient, going back to the Indus Valley civilization and beyond, and major traditions include cylinder seals and other small carvings in the Ancient Near East, which were also made in softer stones. Inlays of semi-precious stones were often used for decoration or highlights in sculptures of other materials, for example statues often had eyes inlaid with white shell and blue lapis lazuli or another stone.
Chinese jade carving begins with the carving of ritual objects, including blades for ji and dagger-axes clearly never intended for use, and the ""Six Ritual Jades"" including the bi and cong, which according to much later literature represented heaven and earth respectively. These are found from the Neolithic Liangzhu culture (3400-2250 BCE) onwards, and blades from the 2nd millennium BCE Shang dynasty on. Traditional Chinese culture attaches strong powers to jade; the jade burial suits in which aristocrats of the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) were buried were intended to preserve the body from decay.

The Chinese and other cultures often attributed specific properties for detecting and neutralizing poison to gemstones, a belief still alive in the European Renaissance, as shown by the works of Georgius Agricola, the ""father of mineralogy"". The English word ""jade"" derives (via the Spanish piedra de ijada) from the Aztec belief that the mineral cured ailments of the kidneys and sides. The Han period also saw the beginning of the tradition of fine decorative jade carving which has lasted until modern times, though the fine carving of other hardstones did not develop until the 17th century, and then appears to have been produced in different workshops and styles from those for jade. In general whiteish nephrite jade was the most highly regarded in China until about 1800, when the deeper and brighter green of the best jadeite became more highly favoured. There are related Asian traditions of Korean jade carving, in Southeast Asia and, to a much lesser extent, Japan.
Smallish Sassanian carvings are known, mostly for seals or jewellery; the central medallion of the ""Cup of Chosroes"" (gallery) is one of the largest. Egyptian carving of rock crystal into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040. In 1062 the Cairo palace of the Fatimid Caliphate was looted by his mercenaries, and the examples found in European treasuries, like the one illustrated, may have been acquired as the booty was dispersed. The rock crystal used in Egypt was apparently traded from East Africa.
Until recently it was thought that jade carving was introduced to the central Asian Islamic world in the Timurid period, but it is becoming clearer that archers' thumb rings, knife hilts, and various other objects had been carved for centuries, even millennia before, though in limited numbers. Islamic jades and other carvings reached a particular peak in the Mughal Empire, where apart from portable carvings inlaid panels of carved stones were included in buildings such as the Taj Mahal. The great wealth of the Mughal court allowed precious stones like rubies and emeralds to be inset freely in objects. The court workshops of the Ottoman Empire also produced lavish and elaborate objects, in similar styles but without reaching the artistic peaks of Mughal carving.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Western traditions ===

From the early civilizations of the near East descended the carving of vessels and small statues in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and subsequent Western art, and also Sassanian Persia; however it is not very significant in the art of ancient Egypt, outside jewellery, as alabaster was a more common material. The jade signet ring of Tutankhamun has been called a ""unique specimen"" of Egyptian jade. Among the seals of the Minoan civilization during the Aegean Bronze Age, the Pylos Combat Agate dated circa 1450 BC is considered one of the finest works of that era, depicting naturalistic details of the human body comparable to works of the much later Classical period.
Hardstone carving more often refers to vessels and figures than smaller engraved gems for seal rings or made as objéts d'art, which were the main artistic expression of hardstone carving in the Greek Classical and Hellenistic periods, and are regarded separately. From the Hellenistic period elaborate vessels in semi-precious stone begin to appear, mostly carved, some in cameo. The Cup of the Ptolemies and Farnese Cup both appear to have been made in Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt, as does a simpler fluted sardonyx cup in Washington which, like the Cup of the Ptolemies, was adapted to be a Christian chalice, and given elaborate gold and jewelled mounts by Abbot Suger for his Abbey of St Denis about 1140.  The elaborately carved Rubens Vase, now in Baltimore, is thought to date from the 4th century.
From the Late Antique plainer shapes for vessels appear, concentrating on showing the natural patterns of figured stones - survivals of these are hard to date, and mostly have survived in church treasuries with medieval mounts in goldsmith work. The best collection of Byzantine liturgical vessels is in the Treasury of San Marco, Venice, some of them booty from the Fourth Crusade. Byzantine artists maintained a tradition throughout the Middle Ages, often working in clear rock crystal. There are a few large pieces from Carolingian art, including the Lothair Crystal, and then a continuing tradition of rock crystal work, often used undecorated in reliquaries and other pieces in the same way as modern glass, for which they are often mistaken by modern viewers. By the end of the Middle Ages a wider variety of stones and objects are seen, used for both religious objects and secular ones.

The Opificio delle pietre dure (""Hardstone workshop"") founded by the Medici in Florence in 1588 soon became the leading workshop in Europe, and developed the pietra dura style of multi-coloured inlays, which use coloured marbles as well as gemstones. They also produced vessels and small sculptures from a single piece of stone, often mounted with gold, which was also a speciality of Milanese workshops. Other rulers followed their example, including Peter the Great, whose Peterhof Lapidary Works, founded in 1721, began the passion among Russian royalty and aristocrats for hardstones. Engraved gem production had already revived, centred on Venice but with artists in many countries, and gems of very high quality continued to be produced until the mid-19th century. The Mannerist court taste of the 16th century delighted in extravagant vessels for serving fruit or sweetmeats, or display as table centrepieces or on sideboards, with hardstones augmented with mounts and bases in precious metal, enamel and jewels. One collection that has remained mostly together is the ""Dauphin's Treasure"" of Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711), which passed to his son Philip V of Spain; over 120 objects are now displayed together in the Museo del Prado, many of which were already over a century old in the Dauphin's lifetime.
In contrast to the vast malachite vases that rather typify Russian carving (picture below), the last notable modern producer was Fabergé in pre-Revolutionary Russia. Before he produced the famous Imperial Easter Eggs he made his reputation with small hardstone figures of animals and people, typically only 25–75mm long or wide, and small vases with a few flowers—the vase and ""water"" in rock crystal and the flowers in various hardstones and enamel.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Pre-Columbian and other traditions ===

Beyond the Old World, hardstone carving was important in various Pre-Columbian cultures, including jade in Mesoamerica and obsidian in Mesoamerica. Because its colour had associations with water and vegetation, jade was also a symbol of life to many cultures; the Maya placed jade beads in the mouths of the dead. Lacking iron, jade was the hardest material the Pre-Columbians were able to work with, apart from emery.
A particular type of object running through the long history of Mesoamerican cultures from the Olmec to the Maya and Aztec is the face ""mask"" in semi-precious stone (they do not seem to have been for actually wearing), either carved from a single piece or of pieces inlaid on a backing of another material. Curators refer to ""Olmec-style"" face masks as despite being Olmec in style, to date no example has been recovered in a controlled archaeological Olmec context. However they have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial precinct of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), which would presumably have been about 2,000 years old when the Aztecs buried it, suggesting these were valued and collected as Roman antiquities were in Europe. The Aztecs' own masks are more typically of turquoise inlay, the Mayans' of jade inlay (see gallery).
Another supposed type of Pre-Columbian hardstone carving is the rock crystal skull; however experts are now satisfied that all known large (life-size) examples are 19th-century forgeries, though some miniature ones may be genuinely Pre-Columbian.
The Māori people of New Zealand, developed the carving of pounamu (jade) for weapons, tools and ornaments to a high standard.


== Techniques ==

Most hardstones, including jade and quartz varieties, have a crystalline structure that does not allow detailed carving by edged tools without great wastage and a poor finish. Working them has always been very time-consuming, which together with the cost of rare materials often traded from very far away, has accounted for the great expense of these objects. After sawing and perhaps chiselling to reach the approximate shape, stones were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a lathe, and by grinding-wheels. Emery has been mined for abrasive powder on Naxos since antiquity, and was known in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by cutters in antiquity. The Chinese sometimes tipped their straight drills with less-valued diamonds.
A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear how they learned this technique. Mughal carvers also used drills. Inlay sections could be sawed by bow saws. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity — since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.


== Imitations ==
As a highly prestigious artform using expensive materials, many different techniques for imitating hardstone carvings have been developed, some of which have themselves created significant artistic traditions. Celadon ware, with a jade coloured glaze, was important in China and Korea, and in early periods used for shapes typical of jade objects. Roman cameo glass was invented to imitate cameo gems, with the advantage that consistent layers were possible even in objects in the round. The small group of 11th(?)-century Hedwig glasses are inspired by Fatimid rock-crystal vessels, and from the 18th century chandeliers in cut glass drew from fantastically expensive rock crystal ones made for the court of Louis XIV. In the Italian Renaissance agate glass was perfected to imitate agate vessels with multicoloured figuration.
Ceramics have often been decorated to imitate gemstones, and wood, plaster and other materials painted to imitate stones. Scagliola developed in Italy to imitate pietra dura inlays on plaster; less elaborate forms are called marbleizing. Medieval illuminated manuscripts often imitated both inlaid stone and engraved gems, and after printing took over paper marbling continued as a manual craft for decorating end-papers and covers.

Wood carving,"Wood carving is a form of working wood by means of a cutting tool. A chisel or knife are usual tools: the chisel can be tapped with a wooden mallet. The result is a wooden figure, or the sculptural ornamentation of a wooden object. A 'wood carving' may also refer to the finished product.
The making of sculpture in wood has a long history. Wood survives much less well than the other materials such as stone and bronze. It is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. Therefore, we do not know much about wood in the art history of older cultures.   Outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed.
Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan are in wood, also most African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions. Wood is light, so it is suitable for masks and other objects meant to be carried. It can take very fine detail, and is also much easier to work than stone.
Some of the finest examples of early European wood carving are from the Middle Ages in Germany, Russia, Italy and France, where the typical themes of that era were used in Christian icons. In England many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century, when oak was often used. In general, really fine carving is done in fruitwood (wood of a fruit tree) because that is easy to work with. The famous woodcarver Grinling Gibbons used to work with lime wood. Complex pieces are often carved in separate sections which are later stuck together.

Rubberwood,"Rubberwood is a light-colored medium-density tropical hardwood obtained from the Pará rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), usually from trees grown in rubber plantations. Rubberwood is commonly advertised as an ""environmentally friendly"" wood, as it makes use of plantation trees that have already served a useful function.


== Other names ==
Rubberwood is also known as plantation hardwood, or ""Hevea"" for the genus that the tree belongs to. In 2002, the Malaysian Ministry of Primary Industries marketed it under the name ""Malaysian Oak"".


== History ==
Although it had been used on a small scale before, its use for furniture making has become much more common in the late 20th and early 21st century with the development of chemical treatments to protect the wood against fungal and insect attacks. There are extensive rubber plantations with mature trees, especially in southeast Asia; the earlier practice was to burn the tree at the end of its latex-producing cycle.
Currently, rubber plantation trees are generally harvested for wood after they complete the latex producing cycle, when they are 25 to 30 years old. When the latex yields become extremely low, the trees are then felled, and new trees are usually planted. This makes rubberwood 'eco-friendly' in a way that the wood is harvested from a renewable source. The wood from the trees is light in color and straight-grained making it easy to stain and match in woodworking. Part of the industry adoption of rubberwood was an international campaign to avoid use of a previously used light straight-grained wood which was harvested from South East Asia's endangered wetland ramin (Gonystylus).


== Chemical treatment ==
Rubberwood is susceptible to fungal and insect attack that limited its use in the past. However, in the 1980s, the development of chemical treatment processes allowed the wood to be more widely used for furniture making and frames. Rubberwood is generally treated soon after sawing by pressurized immersion in boron preservative solution to diffuse the chemicals. Then, the treated timber is kiln-dried to reduce its moisture content.


== Uses ==
Rubberwood has a dense grain that is easily controlled in the kiln drying process. Rubberwood has very little shrinkage, making it one of the more stable construction materials available for furniture, toys, and kitchen accessories. It is easily worked, and takes on stains uniformly. As with all hardwoods, rubberwood comes in varying degrees of quality.
It is not suitable for outdoor use, as rain can leach the protective chemicals from the wood, exposing it to fungus and insect attacks. Excessive moisture will also cause the wood to warp and rot.
Among the items that use rubberwood are the French teething toy, Sophie the Giraffe, which has been manufactured in France since 1961 and of which more than 816,000 were sold in 2010 alone.

Water cycle,"The water cycle (or hydrological cycle) is the cycle that water goes through on Earth.
Water is essential for life as we know it. It is present throughout the Solar System, and was part of the Earth from its formation. The source of the water was the same as the source of the Earth's rock: the cloud particles which condensed in the origin of the Solar System.


== Processes ==
This is the process that water starts and ends in the water cycle.

The cycle starts when water on the surface of the Earth evaporates. Evaporation means the sun heats the water which turns into a gas.
Then, water collects as water vapour in the sky.  This makes clouds.
Next, the water in the clouds gets cold. This makes it become liquid again. This process is called condensation.
Then, the water falls from the sky as rain, snow, sleet or hail. This is called precipitation.
The water sinks into the surface and also collects into lakes, oceans, or aquifers. It evaporates again and continues the cycle.
This whole process in which water evaporate and falls on the land and later flows back in river and pond is known as water cycle.

Installation (computer programs),"Installation means to put a program on a computer so that the computer can run it.
Most programs are stored in special ways to make them smaller, or to gather all the different pieces of a program up into one big piece. Before it can be used, though, the program needs to have these changes undone. Some programs also need to know extra information about the computer it is going to run on, so while it is installing, it will figure out what it needs to know and write it down for later.",0

Apgar score,"The Apgar score is used in medicine. It is a quick way of measuring how healthy a newborn baby is.
Virginia Apgar invented the Apgar score in 1952. She was an anesthesiologist, and created the score to measure how babies were affected by anesthesia given to their mothers during childbirth.
Today, the Apgar score is very commonly used by doctors, nurses, midwives, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and other medical professionals. One of the reasons it is so popular is that doing an Apgar test is very quick. It usually takes less than a minute, sometimes just seconds.
When an Apgar test is done, five simple things about the newborn baby are checked. The newborn gets a score of 0, 1, or 2 on each of these give things. The scores are added up, and the total is the newborn's Apgar score.
""Apgar"" is the name of the woman who invented the Apgar scale. But ""APGAR"" is also a backronym that stands for the things the Apgar scale checks. These are Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration.


== The Apgar score ==


== What the scores mean ==
The Apgar test is usually done one minute after birth, and again five minutes after birth. It may be repeated later if the score is low and stays low.
The main goal of the Apgar score is to see whether the newborn needs medical help. Usually:

Scores of 7 or more are normal, and the newborn only needs basic care.
Scores of 4, 5, and 6 are low. The newborn may need some medical help, like being warmed up or being given oxygen.
Scores of 3 or below are dangerously low. The newborn may need immediate medical help, like CPR or help breathing.


=== Low scores ===
If a newborn has a low Apgar score one minute after birth, this does not mean the baby is going to have long-term health problems. This is especially true if the Apgar score is better five minutes after birth.
But an Apgar score that stays below 3 at later times—like 10, 15, or 30 minutes after birth—may show that the newborn has brain damage. These newborns are a little more likely to have cerebral palsy. However, the Apgar test cannot predict (say for sure) whether a baby will have long-term health problems.

Stirling engine,"A Stirling engine is a kind of heat engine that converts heat into useful mechanical energy by the movement of a piston inside a cylinder within the engine. Unlike other commonly found heat engines such as the internal combustion engine used in cars and the steam engine used on railways, it re-uses the same gas for each stroke of the piston so there is no noisy exhaust. The same gas is repeatedly heated and cooled within the engine’s cylinder.
To run it needs a supply of heat to heat its hot parts. This can come from a fire, but also from the sun’s rays, from hot rocks near a volcano or from nuclear energy. It also has cold parts which cool the gas inside it and these are kept cold by a stream of air or water flowing over them.
It was invented by a Scottish minister, Reverend Dr. Robert Stirling in 1816.",0
Child pyromaniac,"A child pyromaniac is a child with an impulse-control disorder that is primarily distinguished by a compulsion to set fires in order to relieve built-up tension. Child pyromania is the rarest form of fire-setting.
Most young children are not diagnosed with pyromania, but rather with conduct disorders. A key feature of pyromania is repeated association with fire without a real motive.  Pyromania is not a commonly diagnosed disorder, and only occurs in about one percent of the population. It can occur in children as young as three years old.
About ninety percent of the people officially diagnosed with pyromania are male. Pyromaniacs and people with other mental illnesses are responsible for about 14% of fires.


== Symptoms ==
Many clinical studies have found that fire-setting rarely occurs by itself, but usually occurs in addition to other socially unacceptable behavior. The motives that have earned the most attention are pleasure, a cry for help, retaliation against adults, and a desire to reunite the family.
Fire-setting among children and teens can be recurring or periodic. Some children and teens may set fires often to release tension. Others may only seek to set fires during times of great stress. Some of the symptoms of pyromania are depression, conflicts in relationships, and trouble coping with stress and anxiety.


== Diagnosis ==
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, also known as the DSM, gives six standards that must be met for a child to be officially diagnosed with pyromania:

The child has to have set more than one fire deliberately.
Before setting the fire, the child must have felt some feelings of tension or arousal.
The child must show that he or she is attracted to fire and anything related to fire.
The child must feel a sense of relief or satisfaction from setting the fire and witnessing it.
The child does not have other motives like revenge, financial gain, delusions, or brain damage for setting the fire.
The fire-setting problem cannot be attributed to other disorders like anti-social personality disorder or conduct disorders.
Even though fire-setting and pyromania are prevalent in children, these standards are hard to apply to their age group. There is not a lot of experience in diagnosing pyromania, mainly because of the little experience that health care professionals have with fire-setting.


=== Comparison to child fire-setters. ===
There are many important distinctions between a child pyromaniac and a child fire-setter. In general, a fire-setter is any individual who feels the impulse to set a fire for unusual reasons.
While a child fire-setter is usually curious about fire and has the desire to learn more about it, a child pyromaniac has an unusually bizarre impulse or desire to set intentional fires.
Pyromania, also known as pathological fire-setting, is when the desire to set fires is repetitive and destructive to people or property. The most important difference between pyromania and fire-setting is that pyromania is a mental disorder, but fire-setting is simply a behavior and can be more easily fixed.
Minor or non-severe fire-setting is defined as ""accidental or occasional fire-starting behavior"" by unsupervised children. Usually these fires are started when a curious child plays with matches, lighters, or small fires. Juveniles in this minor group average at most 2.5 accidental fires in their lifetime.
Most children in this group are between five and ten years of age and do not realize the dangers of playing with fire. Pathological fire-setting manifests when the action is ""a deliberate, planned, and persistent behavior"". Juveniles in this severe group set about 5.3 fires.
Most young children are not diagnosed as having pyromania but conduct disorders.

There are two basic types of children that start fires. The first type is the curiosity fire-setter who starts the fire just to find out what will happen. The second type is the problem fire-setter who usually sets fires based on changes in their environment or due to a conduct disorder.


== Causes ==
Fire-setting is made up of five subcategories: the curious fire-setter, the sexually motivated fire-setter, the ""cry for help"" fire-setter, the ""severely disturbed"" group, and the rare form of pyromania. Pyromania usually surfaces in childhood, but there is no conclusive data about the average age of onset.
Child pyromaniacs are usually filled with an uncontrollable urge to set fires to relieve tension. Not much is known about what genetically causes pyromania but there have been many studies that have explored the topic.
The causes of fire setting among young children and youths can be attributed to many factors, which are divided into individual and environmental factors:

Individual factors
Antisocial behaviors and attitudes: Children that set fires usually do not only set fires but also commit other crimes or offenses including vandalism, violence, anger, etc.
Sensation seeking: Some children are attracted to fire-setting because they are bored and are looking for something to do.
Attention seeking: Lighting a fire becomes a way to ""get back"" at adults and, in turn, produce a response from the adults.
Lack of social skills: Some children simply have not been taught enough social skills. Many children and adolescents who have been discovered setting fires consider themselves to be ""loners"".
Lack of fire-safety skills and ignorance of danger: This is what drives most children who do not display signs of pyromania- just natural curiosity and ignorance of the fire's destructive power.
Learning difficulties.
Parental conflicts like separation, neglect, and abuse.
Sexual abuse.
Maltreatment.
Environmental factors
Poor supervision by parents or guardians.
Seeing adults use fire inappropriately at an early age.
Parental neglect.
Parents abusing drugs or acting violently- this factor has been studied and the conclusions show that fire-setters are more likely in homes where the parents abuse them.
Peer pressure.
Stressful life events: Fire-setting becomes a way to cope with crises.


== Treatment ==
If a child is diagnosed with pyromania, there are treatment options despite the lack of scientific research on the genetic cause. Studies have shown that children with repeat cases of setting fires tend to respond better to a case-management approach rather than a medical approach.
The first crucial step for treatment should be parents sitting down with their child and having a one-on-one interview. The interview itself should try to determine which stresses on the family, methods of discipline, or other factors contribute to the child's uncontrollable desire to set fires. Some examples of treatment methods are problem-solving skills, anger management, communication skills, aggression replacement training, and cognitive restructuring.
The chances that a child will recover from pyromania are very slim according to recent studies, but there are ways to channel the child's desire to set fires to relieve tension—for example, alternate activities such as playing a sport or an instrument. 
Another method of treatment is fire-safety education. At times, the best method of treatment is child counseling or a residential treatment center.
However, since cases of child pyromania are so rare, there has not been enough research done on the success of these treatment methods. The most common and effective treatment of pyromania in children is behavioral modification. The results usually range from fair to poor. Behavioral modification seems to work on children with pyromaniac tendencies about 95% of the time.


== History ==
Early studies into the causes of pyromania come from Freudian psychoanalysis. Around 1850, there were many arguments about the causes of pyromania.
The two biggest sides of the argument were whether pyromania comes from a mental or genetic disorder or moral deficiency. Freud reasoned that fire-setting was an archaic desire to gain power over nature.
The first study done on fire-setting behavior in children was in 1940 and was credited to Helen Yarnall, who compared fire-setting to fears of castration in male children and said that by setting a fire, some young males feel that they have gained power over adults. This 1940 study also introduced the idea that a good predictor of violent behavior in adult life is fire-setting and cruelty towards animals as a child.

Stepped profile,"A stepped profile describes the edge of something that has a series of defined steps. It has applications in architecture, construction, engineering, and geology.


== Applications ==


=== Architecture and construction ===
In building design a stepped profile is used to reduce the visual impact of, or airborne noise around a building. A stepped profile is also used to calculate seismic and wind loads in multi-story building design.
The spillway from a dam can have a stepped profile, which dissipates energy from the released water.


=== Engineering ===
In engineering, a stepped profile may be used on a bearing surface to reduce friction between the moving parts.


=== Geology ===
A mountain with a stepped profile has a number of denudation terraces caused by erosion.
A river with a stepped profile has a step-like variation in its gradient along its length. This may be caused by changes in the height of the underlying bedrock.

Some car fires are arson.",0
Terminal tourism,"Terminal tourism refers to non-passengers accessing businesses and facilities within airport terminals. Individuals without tickets who access businesses and facilities in airport terminals are referred to as terminal tourists. Reasons for engaging in terminal tourism, include access to shopping and restaurants, aircraft spotting, and accompanying traveling family members. Traditionally, the general public had unrestricted access to businesses and facilities within airport terminals, however after the September 11 attacks in the United States, access in some airports was restricted to either higher security or limiting access only to ticketed passengers and employees.


== In the United States ==
In the United States, the concept was first accepted at Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) in 2017. Since then, similar programs have also been created in Tampa International Airport (TPA), Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA), Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), and Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (MSY). 


=== Security ===
Terminal tourists are subject to the same security measures as passengers. Some airports limit the times and number of non-travelers who are granted access, while others require a reservation. Everybody must pass through airport security.  Background checks are also occasionally a requirement, and prospective terminal tourists in the United States are screened against the No Fly List.

Chosen people,"Many people have considered themselves to be the chosen people. Usually, a deity chose them to fulfill a specific role, or purpose. In monotheistic religions, this is used to construct ""God's chosen people"". One of the common cases was that the Israelites. Sometimes the claim is constructed because even though the people are not related to the Israelites, the ideas are similar.",0
Mammon,"Mammon (Aramaic: מָמוֹנָא, māmōnā) in the New Testament is commonly thought to mean money, material wealth, or any entity that promises wealth, and is associated with the greedy pursuit of gain. The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke both quote Jesus using the word in a phrase often rendered in English as ""You cannot serve both God and mammon.""
In the Middle Ages, it was often personified and sometimes included in the seven princes of Hell.
Mammon in Hebrew (ממון) means 'money'. The word was adopted to modern Hebrew to mean wealth.


== Etymology ==
The word Mammon comes into English from post-classical Latin mammona 'wealth', used most importantly in the Vulgate Bible (along with Tertullian's mammonas and pseudo-Jerome's mammon). This was in turn borrowed from Hellenistic Greek μαμωνᾶς, which appears in the New Testament, borrowed from Aramaic מָמוֹנָא  māmōnā, an emphatic form of the word māmōn 'wealth, profit', perhaps specifically from the Syriac dialect. The spelling μαμμωνᾷ refers to ""a Syrian deity, god of riches; Hence riches, wealth""; μαμωνᾶς is transliterated from Aramaic [ממון] and also means ""wealth"". However, it is not clear what the earlier history of the Aramaic form was. The word may have been present throughout the Canaanite languages: the word is unknown in Old Testament Hebrew, but has been found in the Qumran documents; post-biblical Hebrew attests to māmōn; and, according to Augustine of Hippo, Punic included the word mammon 'profit'. It has been suggested that the Aramaic word māmōn was a loanword from Mishnaic Hebrew ממון (mamôn) meaning money, wealth, or possessions; although it may also have meant ""that in which one trusts"". 
According to the Textus Receptus of the New Testament, the Greek word translated ""Mammon"" is spelt μαμμωνᾷ in the Sermon on the Mount at Matthew 6:24, and μαμωνᾶ (from μαμωνᾶς) in the Parable of the Unjust Steward at Luke 16:9,11,13. The 27th edition of the popular Critical Text of the New Testament has μαμωνᾶ in all four places with no indication of any textual variances, thereby ignoring the Textus Receptus reading at Matthew 6:24. The Liddell and Scott Lexicon has a listing for each spelling, indicating that each occurs only in the New Testament, nowhere else in ancient and Hellenistic Greek literature. The spelling μαμμωνᾷ refers to ""a Syrian deity, god of riches; Hence riches, wealth""; μαμωνᾶς is transliterated from Aramaic [ממון] and also means ""wealth"". The Authorised Version uses ""Mammon"" for both Greek spellings; John Wycliffe uses richessis.
The Revised Standard Version of the Bible says it is ""a Semitic word for money or riches"". The International Children's Bible (ICB) uses the wording ""You cannot serve God and money at the same time"".
Christians began to use ""mammon"" as a term that was used to describe gluttony, excessive materialism, greed, and unjust worldly gain.

Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Early mentions of Mammon allude to the Gospels, e.g., Didascalia, ""De solo Mammona cogitant, quorum Deus est sacculus"" (lit. They think only of Mammon, whose God is the purse); and Saint Augustine, ""Lucrum Punice Mammon dicitur"" (lit. ""Riches is called Mammon by the Phoenicians""  (Sermon on the Mount, ii).


== Personifications ==
Gregory of Nyssa also asserted that Mammon was another name for Beelzebub.
In the 4th century Cyprian and Jerome relate Mammon to greed and greed as an evil master that enslaves, and John Chrysostom even personifies Mammon as greed.
During the Middle Ages, Mammon was commonly personified as the demon of wealth and greed. Thus Peter Lombard (II, dist. 6) says, ""Riches are called by the name of a devil, namely Mammon, for Mammon is the name of a devil, by which name riches are called according to the Syrian tongue."" Piers Plowman also regards Mammon as a deity. Nicholas de Lyra, commenting on the passage in Luke, says: ""Mammon est nomen daemonis"" (Mammon is the name of a demon).
Albert Barnes in his Notes on the New Testament states that Mammon was a Syriac word for an idol worshipped as the god of riches, similar to Plutus among the Greeks, but he cited no authority for the statement.
No trace, however, of any Syriac god of such a name exists, and the common literary identification of the name with a god of covetousness or avarice likely stems from Spenser's The Faerie Queene, where Mammon oversees a cave of worldly wealth. Milton's Paradise Lost describes a fallen angel who values earthly treasure over all other things.  Later occultist writings such as Jacques Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal describe Mammon as Hell's ambassador to England. For Thomas Carlyle in Past and Present (1843), the ""Gospel of Mammonism"" became simply a metaphoric personification for the materialist spirit of the 19th century.
Mammon is somewhat similar to the Greek god Plutus, and the Roman Dis Pater, in his description, and it is likely that he was at some point based on them; especially since Plutus appears in The Divine Comedy as a wolf-like demon of wealth, wolves having been associated with greed in the Middle Ages. Thomas Aquinas metaphorically described the sin of Avarice as ""Mammon being carried up from Hell by a wolf, coming to inflame the human heart with Greed"".
Under the influence of the Social Gospel movement, American populists, progressives and ""muck-rakers"" during the generation of 1880–1925 used ""Mammon"" with specific reference to the consolidated wealth and power of the banking and corporate institutions headquartered on Wall Street and their predatory activities nationwide.


== In various countries ==
""Mamona"" (sometimes ""Mamuna"") is a synonym for mammon among Slavs.  In the 21st century, the word ""mamona"" is used figuratively and derogatorily in Polish as a synonym of money. In Slovak the word mamonár is sometimes used to refer to a greedy person.
The word ""mammona"" is quite often used in the Finnish and Estonian languages as a synonym of material wealth.
In German, the word ""Mammon"" is a colloquial and contemptuous term for ""money"". Usually as a phrase in combination with the adjective ""schnöde"" (""der schnöde Mammon"" = the contemptible mammon).


== In literature ==
The 1409 Lollard manuscript titled Lanterne of Light associated Mammon with the deadly sin of the greed.
In Past and Present (1843), Thomas Carlyle describes Victorian England's worship of money as the ""Gospel of Mammonism"".


== In popular culture ==

Numerous characters and demons are named Mammon in books, film, television, and games.

Tally stick,"A tally stick (or simply a tally) was an ancient memory aid used to record and document numbers, quantities, and messages. Tally sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches during the Upper Palaeolithic; a notable example is the Ishango Bone. Historical reference is made by Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79) about the best wood to use for tallies, and by Marco Polo (1254–1324) who mentions the use of the tally in China. Tallies have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling, and especially in financial and legal transactions, to the point of being currency.


== Kinds of tallies ==

There are two principal forms of tally sticks: the single tally and the split tally. A comparable example of this primitive counting device can be found in various types of prayer beads.


=== Possible palaeolithic tally sticks ===
A number of anthropological artefacts have been conjectured to be tally sticks:

The Lebombo bone, dated between 44,200 and 43,000 years old, is a baboon's fibula with 29 distinct notches, discovered within the Border Cave in the Lebombo Mountains of Eswatini.
The so-called Wolf bone (cs) is a prehistoric artefact discovered in 1937 in Czechoslovakia during excavations at Dolní Věstonice, Moravia, led by Karl Absolon. Dated to the Aurignacian, approximately 30,000 years ago, the bone is marked with 55 marks which some believe to be tally marks. The head of an ivory Venus figurine was excavated close to the bone.
The Ishango bone is a bone tool, dated to the Upper Palaeolithic era, around 18,000 to 20,000 BC. It is a dark brown length of bone. It has a series of possible tally marks carved in three columns running the length of the tool. It was found in 1950 in Ishango (east Belgian Congo).


=== Single tally ===
The single tally stick was an elongated piece of bone, ivory, wood, or stone which is marked with a system of notches (see: Tally marks). The single tally stick serves predominantly mnemonic purposes. Related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks (used by, e.g., Inuit tribes), the knotted cords, khipus or quipus, as used by the Inca. Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484 – c. 425 BC) reported  the use of a knotted cord by Darius I of Persia (r. 522 – 486 BC).


=== Split tally ===
The split tally became a prevalent technique in medieval Europe, a time characterised by a scarcity of coinage and widespread illiteracy, to document bilateral exchanges and debts. Typically fashioned from squared hazelwood, the stick was inscribed with a series of notches before being split lengthwise. Each party in the transaction retained one half of the marked stick, both pieces bearing identical records. Over the years, this method was refined to the point of becoming virtually impervious to tampering. One such refinement was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called stock and was given to the stock holder, which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called foil and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the Napoleonic Code (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333.  Along the Danube and in Switzerland the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.
The most prominent and best recorded use of the split tally stick or ""nick-stick"" being used as a form of currency was when Henry I introduced the tally stick system in medieval England in around 1100. The tally sticks recorded a payment of taxes, but soon began to circulate in a secondary discount market, being accepted as payment for goods and services at a discount since they could be later presented to the treasury as proof of taxes paid. Then tally sticks began to be issued in advance, in order to finance war and other royal spending, and circulated as ""wooden money"". 
The system of tally marks of the Exchequer is described in The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer as follows:

The manner of cutting is as follows. At the top of the tally a cut is made, the thickness of the palm of the hand, to represent a thousand pounds; then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadth of a thumb; twenty pounds, the breadth of the little finger; a single pound, the width of a swollen barleycorn; a shilling rather narrower; then a penny is marked by a single cut without removing any wood.
The cuts were made the full width of the stick so that, after splitting, the portion kept by the issuer (the stock) exactly matched the piece (the foil) given as a receipt. Each stick had to have the details of the transaction written on it, in ink, to make it a valid record.

Royal tallies (debt of the Crown) also played a role in the formation of the Bank of England at the end of the 17th century. In 1697, the bank issued £1 million worth of stock in exchange for £800,000 worth of tallies at par and £200,000 in bank notes. This new stock was said to be ""engrafted"". The government promised not only to pay the Bank interest on the tallies subscribed but to redeem them over a period of years. The ""engrafted"" stock was then cancelled simultaneously with the redemption.
The split tally of the Exchequer remained in continuous use in England until 1826, when the conditions required for activation of the Receipt of the Exchequer Act 1783 (23 Geo. 3. c. 82), the death of the last Exchequer Chamberlain, came about. In 1834, following the passing of 4 Will. 4. c .15, tally sticks representing six centuries' worth of financial records were ordered to be burned in two furnaces in the Houses of Parliament. The resulting fire set the chimney ablaze and then spread until most of the building was destroyed. This event was described by Charles Dickens in an 1855 article on administrative reform.
Tally sticks feature in the design of the entrance gates to The National Archives at Kew.

Regius Professor of Astronomy (Edinburgh),"The Regius Chair of Astronomy is one of eight  Regius Professorships at the  University of Edinburgh, and was founded in 1785. Regius Professorships are those that have in the past been established by the  British Crown, and are still formally appointed by the current monarch, although they are advertised and recruited by the relevant university following the normal processes for appointing a professorship.


== Relationship with the Astronomer Royal for Scotland ==
The Regius Chair of Astronomy in Edinburgh is unusual because of its relationship with the position of the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, and the  Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE). Between 1834 and 1990, the Regius Professor at the University, the Astronomer Royal, and the Director of the Royal Observatory were all the same person. This is no longer true however, as explained  under ""New Structure"" below.


== Early history ==
Astronomy was originally taught in Edinburgh by the Chairs of Mathematics and of Natural Philosophy. 
A Chair of Practical Astronomy was established in 1785 by a Royal Warrant signed by George III. The first holder was  Robert Blair, who held the position until his death in 1828. However, he was never provided with an observatory or any instruments, and refused to do any teaching, seeing the position as a sinecure.
At that time, the Royal Commission was reviewing Scottish Universities and recommended that the chair should not be filled 'until a suitable observatory... could be established' 
Meanwhile, outside the University, the  Edinburgh Astronomical Institution, a club of private individuals, had succeeded in building an observatory on Calton Hill in a new building designed by  William Playfair. In 1822 the Institution presented a loyal address to George IV, resulting in the observatory being granted the title of Royal Observatory. After considerable delay and negotiation, in 1834  Thomas Henderson was appointed as both the first Astronomer Royal for Scotland and the second Regius Professor. He remained in both positions until he died in 1844. Thomas Henderson's main claim to fame is being, along with  Friedrich Bessel, the first astronomer to measure the  parallax of a star, and hence a reliable stellar distance. He made his measurements at the  Cape of Good Hope and reduced the data after taking up his position in Edinburgh.
In 1846  Charles Piazzi Smyth became Regius Professor and Astronomer Royal, and held both positions until he retired in 1888. He was the first Regius Professor to actually provide lectures in Astronomy, sixty five years after the founding of the chair.
Piazzi Smyth had a long and full career, including the establishment of a public time service via the Time Ball and the One O'Clock Gun, the exploration of the idea of mountain top astronomy, the investigation of the spectra of the Sun, the Zodiac and the Aurora, and innovative developments in photography.
Later in his life he became obsessed with mystical interpretations of the Pyramids.


== The new observatory ==
Following the retirement of Piazzi Smyth, both the future of the Royal Observatory and the Regius Professorship were once again thrown into uncertainty by a Royal Commission on Scottish Universities, until the generous gift of Lord Lindsay led to the creation of a new Royal Observatory building on Blackford Hill (see  for extensive detail), and  Ralph Copeland  was appointed as fourth Regius Professor and third Astronomer Royal. Copeland was well known for spectroscopic observations of planets, comets, and nebulae, and was the first person to observe Helium outside the Sun. He also carried out extensive travel, both to observe transits of Venus, and to continue Piazzi Smyth's researches into mountain top astronomy.
Copeland died in 1905 and was replaced both as Regius Professor and as Astronomer Royal by  Frank Dyson. He was the first Regius Professor whose title was simply ""Chair of Astronomy"" rather than ""Chair of Practical Astronomy"". He investigated the spectrum of the solar corona and chromosphere. In 1910 he left to become Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory and (English) Astronomer Royal - the only astronomer to have held both Astronomer Royal positions. He later became famous for organising eclipse expeditions which helped to proved Einstein's General Relativity Theory, and for instigating the transmission of the ""pips"" from the Greenwich Observatory to the BBC.
In 1910 Dyson was replaced by  Ralph Sampson. Before coming to Edinburgh Sampson was well known for pioneering work on the colour temperature of stars, and a theory of the motions of the Galilean satellites. After his appointment, his work took a very practical turn, aiming at producing a more accurate time service, improving the optical performance of telescopes, and developing a recording microphotometer and techniques for performing spectrophotometry of stars. He also led the construction of 36inch telescope which still sits in the East Tower of the ROE. Sampson retired in 1937, to be replaced by  W.M.H. Greaves in 1938. Greaves kept the national time service going the war, and led extensive work on determining the temperatures of stars, and the physical properties of their atmospheres, using spectrophotometry, as well as studies of the effect of sunspots in terrestrial magnetism. He died suddenly in 1955, and was replaced as both Regius Professor and Astronomer Royal by  Hermann Bruck.


== Modern developments ==
During the 1960s and 1970s, the ROE underwent considerable expansion, so that technical and scientific contributions are properly seen as due to a whole community. Nonetheless, it is possible to discern clear themes in the leadership of successive astronomers.
Hermann Bruck was the most important historical figure for Edinburgh astronomy, at least in leadership terms. When he arrived in 1957 the observatory had six scientific staff. By the time he retired in 1975, there over a hundred, and the observatory was established as a major international centre. There were three main themes to his leadership. The first, together with his wife Mary Bruck (nee Conway) was the creation of the first full Astrophysics degree, and the expansion of first year astronomy teaching to large classes of students from many disciplines. The second theme was automation - both computerised data reduction, and the creation of automated measuring machines, which led to a sequence of machines which scanned and digitised photographic plates - GALAXY, COSMOS, and SuperCOSMOS. The third theme was the development of mountaintop overseas observatories, fulfilling the dreams of Piazzi-Smyth. This work began with the creation of a station at Monte Porzio in Italy, followed by the design of a Northern Hemisphere Observatory in La Palma (which was then implemented by the Royal Greenwich Observatory), the building and operation of the UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia, and finally the building and operation of the infra-red specialised UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) in Hawaii. Bruck retired in 1975.
The next holder of both the Regius Professorship and the Astronomer Royal position was Vincent Reddish, who had been at ROE since the 1960s, and in fact was to a large extent responsible for many of the advances in the Bruck era - automation, systematic sky surveys, and the creation of the  UK Schmidt Telescope and UKIRT. He resigned in 1978 and concentrated on his controversial private researches into dowsing.
Malcolm Longair was appointed to the joint position in 1980, and continued the trends started by Bruck and Reddish of making the Royal Observatory Edinburgh a centre of astronomical technology and sky survey work. Under Longair's leadership the ROE created a radical new facility, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and built a series of ground breaking instruments for both ground-based and space-based instruments. University leadership in Astronomy was however largely delegated to Mary Bruck and Peter Brand, under whom the Department of Astronomy merged with the Department of Physics, and was re-named the Institute for Astronomy. Longair resigned in 1990, during a difficult period of political discussion over the structure of British Astronomy, and moved to the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge.

Transcendental theology,"Transcendental theology is a term invented by Immanuel Kant to describe a method of discerning theological concepts. Kant divided transcendental theology into ""ontotheology"" and cosmotheology, both of which he also invented, ""in order to distinguish between two competing types of 'transcendental theology'"".
Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: 

""Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology.""

A critique of transcendental theology as developed by Kant is that it is argued that human reason is not capable of proving God's existence. Kant solves this problem by appealing to moral symbolism. Thus, Kant describes God as a moral trinity: holy lawgiver, good governor, and just judge.

Conflagration,"A conflagration is a large fire. Conflagrations often damage human life, animal life, health, and/or property. A conflagration can begin accidentally or be intentionally created (arson). A very large fire can produce a firestorm, in which the central column of rising heated air induces strong inward winds, which supply oxygen to the fire. Conflagrations can cause casualties including deaths or injuries from burns, trauma due to collapse of structures and attempts to escape, and smoke inhalation.
Firefighting is the practice of extinguishing a conflagration, protecting life and property and minimizing damage and injury. One of the goals of fire prevention is to avoid conflagrations. When a conflagration is extinguished, there is often a fire investigation to determine the cause of the fire.


== Causes and types ==
During a conflagration a significant movement of air and combustion products occurs. Hot gaseous products of combustion move upward, causing the influx of more dense cold air to the combustion zone. Sometimes, the influx is so intense that the fire grows into a firestorm.
Inside a building, the intensity of gas exchange depends on the size and location of openings in walls and floors, the ceiling height, and the amount and characteristics of the combustible materials.

Industrial conflagrations include fires at oil refineries, such as the 2009 Cataño oil refinery fire.
Wildfires are fires in forests or other undeveloped areas, and may grow into a conflagration.
An urban conflagration is defined as a ""large, destructive fire that spreads beyond natural or artificial barriers; it can be expected to result in large monetary loss and may or may not include fatalities. An urban conflagration moves beyond a block and destroys whole sections of a city."" Notable examples includes the Great Fire of London in 1666, the Great Fire of Tartu in 1775, the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, and the Great Fire of Hamburg in 1842, and the Camp Fire in Paradise, California in 2018, which burned 18,000 structures and killed 85 people.
On board ships, a large uncontained fire may quickly lead to a ship conflagration.
The conflagration of a building is known as a structure fire.

Site-specific art,"Site-specific art is artwork created to exist in a certain place. Typically, the artist takes the location into account while planning and creating the artwork. Site-specific art is produced both by commercial artists, and independently, and can include some instances of work such as sculpture, stencil graffiti, rock balancing, and other art forms. Installations can be in urban areas, remote natural settings, or underwater.


== History ==

The term ""site-specific art"" was promoted and refined by Californian artist Robert Irwin but it was actually first used in the mid-1970s by young sculptors, such as Patricia Johanson, Dennis Oppenheim, and Athena Tacha, who had started executing public commissions for large urban sites. For Two Jumps for Dead Dog Creek (1970), Oppenheim attempted a series of standing jumps at a selected site in Idaho, where ""the width of the creek became a specific goal to which I geared a bodily activity,"" with his two successful jumps being ""dictated by a land form."" Site specific environmental art was first described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic Lucy Lippard. Emerging out of minimalism, site-specific art opposed the Modernist program of subtracting from the artwork all cues that interfere with the fact that it is ""art"",
Modernist art objects were transportable,  nomadic, could only exist in the museum space and were the objects of the market and commodification. Since 1960 the artists were trying to find a way out of this situation, and thus drew attention to the site and the context around this site. The work of art was created in the site and could only exist and in such circumstances - it can not be moved or changed. The notion of ""site"" precisely references the current location, which comprises a unique combination of physical elements: depth, length, weight, height, shape, walls, temperature. Works of art began to emerge from the walls of the museum and galleries (Daniel Buren, Within and Beyond the Frame, John Weber Gallery, New York, 1973), were created specifically for the museum and galleries (Michael Asher, untitled installation at Claire Copley Gallery, Los Angeles, 1974, Hans Haacke, Condensation Cube, 1963–65, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Hartford Wash: Washing Tracks, Maintenance Outside, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, 1973), thus criticizing the museum as an institution that sets the rules for artists and viewers.
Jean-Max Albert, created Sculptures Bachelard in Parc de la Villette related to the site, or Carlotta’s Smile, a trellis construction related to Ar. Co,’s architecture Lisbon, and to a choreography in collaboration with Michala Marcus and Carlos Zingaro, 1979.
When the public debate over Tilted Arc (1981) resulted in its removal in 1989, its author Richard Serra reacted with what can be considered a definition of site-specific art: ""To move the work is to destroy the work.""


== Examples ==
Outdoor site-specific artworks often include landscaping combined with permanently sited sculptural elements; it is sometimes linked with environmental art. Outdoor site-specific artworks can also include dance performances created especially for the site. More broadly, the term is sometimes used for any work that is more or less permanently attached to a particular location. In this sense, a building with interesting architecture could also be considered a piece of site-specific art.

In Geneva, Switzerland, the Contemporary Art Funds are looking for original ways to integrate art into architecture and the public space since 1980. The Neon Parallax project, initiated in 2004, is conceived specifically for the Plaine de Plainpalais, a public square of 95'000 square meters, in the heart of the city. The concept consists of commissioning luminous artistic works for the rooftops of the buildings bordering the plaza, in the same way, advertisements are installed on the city's glamorous lakefront. The 14 artists invited had to respect the same legal sizes of luminous advertisements in Geneva. The project thus creates a parallax both between locations, and messages, but also by the way one interprets neon signs in the public realm.
Site-specific performance art, site-specific visual art and interventions are commissioned for the annual Infecting the City Festival in Cape Town, South Africa. The site-specific nature of the work allows artists to interrogate the contemporary and historic reality of the Central Business District and create work that allows the city's users to engage and interact with public spaces in new and memorable ways.

Play money,"Play money, toy money, faux paper money or formally ludic money is money that functions as a toy or a token in a game or when playing.: 24 
The first such toy money was printed in 1880 by the Milton Bradley Toys company, and was actually a teaching tool, distributed to schools so that children could play at commercial transactions and learn skills for reckoning change, recognizing coins, and budgeting purchases.
The rules of play money usually follow the same lines as they do for real money: counterfeiting is considered cheating at a game. Play money is a common type of game resource that can be earned, spent and lost.: 25-26 
Although poker chips are used in game play, the distinction between them and play money is threefold: play money is not intended to be used in gambling, play money (except for its value as a collectable item of board game parphenalia) is not exchangeable for real currency, and play money (especially when used for teaching) tends to have some physical resemblance to actual currency.
The owners of Selchow & Righter, which sold Milton Bradley branded games, had religious objections to gambling, and went so far as to object to any gaming use of play money, rejecting any game ideas that required it, to the extent that Harriet Righter passed over the chance to acquire the rights to Monopoly.
As a form of escapism, to a fantasy world where people were not poor, games with play money were popular during the Great Depression, but their popularity waned afterwards over the decades.
A further decline in popularity has occurred because inflation has placed most coins of actual currencies within the spending abilities of children, obviating the need for play money as a cheap substitute.
At its most basic level, play money refers to faux paper money, but some games can include coins, or more abstract tokens representing more generic resources (such as energy).: 25-26  Play money also encompasses virtual currencies in the complex in-game economies of MMORPGs, but again unlike older physical play money, in-game virtual currencies are exchangeable, to greater or lesser degree, with real currency.
This has led to a whole economic system that has no analogue with physical game money, with virtual trading indexes, and currency exchange mechanisms for countries that do not accept real currencies like the United States dollar.
Whereas Monopoly money is tangible and physical and only exists within an economic system controlled by a single game board, virtual currencies are intangible and exist within an economic system that spans multiple on-line games and extends to the currency of the real world.

Ephemeral art,"Ephemeral art is the name given to all artistic expression conceived under a concept of transience in time, of non-permanence as a material and conservable work of art. Because of its perishable and transitory nature, ephemeral art (or temporary art) does not leave a lasting work, or if it does – as would be the case with fashion – it is no longer representative of the moment in which it was created. In these expressions, the criterion of social taste is decisive, which is what sets the trends, for which the work of the media is essential, as well as that of art criticism.

Regardless of the fact that any artistic expression may or may not be enduring in time, and that many works conceived under the criteria of durability may disappear in a short period of time for any undetermined circumstance, ephemeral art has in its genesis a component of transience, of fleeting object or expression in time. It is a passing, momentary art, conceived for instantaneous consumption. Based on this assumption, the ephemeral arts are those whose nature is not to last in time, or those that are constantly changing and fluctuating. Within this genre, expressions such as fashion, hairdressing, perfumery, gastronomy and pyrotechnics can be considered ephemeral arts, as well as various manifestations of body art such as tattooing and piercing. The concept of ephemeral art would also include the various forms of so-called action art, such as happening, performance, environment and installation, or conceptual art, such as body art and land art, as well as other expressions of popular culture, such as graffiti. Finally, within architecture there is also a typology of constructions that are usually expressed as ephemeral architecture, since they are conceived as transitory buildings that fulfil a function restricted to a period of time.
Temporary art is usually displayed outdoors at public landmarks or in unexpected places. Temporary art is often promoted by cities, or featured in conjunction with events or festivals.


== Fundamentals of ephemeral art ==

The ephemeral nature of certain artistic expressions is above all a subjective concept subject to the very definition of art, a controversial term open to multiple meanings, which have oscillated and evolved over time and geographic space, since the term ""art"" has not been understood in the same way in all times and places. Art is a component of culture, reflecting in its conception the economic and social substrates, and the transmission of ideas and values, inherent in any human culture across space and time. However, the definition of art is open, subjective, debatable; there is no unanimous agreement among historians, Philosophers or Artists. In classical Greco-Roman antiquity, one of the main cradles of Western civilisation and the first culture to reflect on art, art was considered to be a human ability in any productive field, practically a synonym for ""skill"". In the 2nd century Galen divided art into liberal arts and vulgar arts, according to whether they had an intellectual or manual origin. The liberal arts included grammar, rhetoric and dialectics – which formed the trivium – and arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music – which formed the quadrivium; the vulgar arts included architecture, sculpture and painting, but also other activities that are nowadays considered Crafts. In the 16th century, architecture, painting and sculpture began to be seen as activities that required not only craft and skill, but also a kind of intellectual conception that made them superior to other kinds of crafts. Thus was born the modern concept of art, which during the Renaissance acquired the name of arti del disegno (arts of design), since it was understood that this activity – designing – was the main activity in the genesis of works of art. Later, expressions such as music, poetry and dance were considered artistic activities, and in 1746 Charles Batteux established in The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle the current conception of Fine arts, a term that has become successful and has survived to the present day. However, attempts to establish some basic criteria as to which expressions can be considered art and which cannot have been somewhat unsuccessful, producing in a way the opposite effect and accentuating even more the lack of definition of art, which today is an open and interpretable concept, where many formulas and conceptions fit, although a minimum common denominator based on aesthetic and expressive qualities, as well as a component of creativity, is generally accepted. Currently, to the traditional classification of the arts, certain critics and historians have added expressions such as photography, cinematography, comics, theatre, television, fashion, advertising, animation, Video games, etc., and there is still some disagreement about other types of expressive activities.
An essential aspect in the genesis of art is its social component, the interrelationship between artist and spectator, between the work and its consumer. A work of art responds to social and cultural criteria, of space and time, outside of which, even if it endures as a physical object, it loses its conceptual significance, the reason for which it was created. Even so, Human beings have always been eager to collect and keep these objects for their unique and unrepeatable qualities, as documents of eras that endure in the memory, and which represent genuine expressions of the peoples and cultures that have succeeded one another over time. Precisely, the collectible nature of certain objects, as opposed to others that are more quickly consumed, represented a first barrier between the classification of certain expressions as art and not others, often pejoratively referred to as ""fashion"", ""ornament"", ""entertainment"" and similar terms. Museums and art academies, responsible for the conservation and dissemination of art, were also in charge of sponsoring and giving priority to some artistic expressions over others, and while paintings and sculptures entered these institutions without any problem, other objects or creations of various kinds were relegated to oblivion after having fulfilled their momentary function, or at most remained in the memory through written testimonies or documents attesting to their existence.
There has long been speculation about the artisticity of ephemeral expressions, about whether the ephemeral character of art and beauty can devalue these concepts. The devaluation of the ephemeral begins with Plato, for whom beautiful things were not enduring, since the only eternal thing is the ""idea of the beautiful"". Similarly, Christianity – from which all medieval aesthetics emanated – rejected physical beauty as transient, since the only immutable beauty was that of God. From the 19th century, however, a change of attitude towards ephemeral beauty began to take place, and it began to be valued for its intrinsic qualities. The Romantics valued 'what will never be seen twice', and Goethe went so far as to assert that only the ephemeral is beautiful: 'Why am I ephemeral, O Zeus? says Beauty / I do not make beautiful, says Zeus, any more than the ephemeral' (The Seasons).

Although various manifestations that can be considered as ephemeral art have existed since the beginnings of human artistic expressivity – it could even be considered as something inherent to a certain conception of art – it was in the 20th century when these forms of expression acquired a great boom. Contemporary aesthetics has presented a great diversity of trends, in parallel with the atomisation of styles produced in 20th century art. Both aesthetics and art today reflect cultural and philosophical ideas that were emerging at the turn of the 19th–20th century, in many cases contradictory: the overcoming of the rationalist ideas of the Enlightenment and the move towards more subjective and individual concepts, starting with the Romantic movement and crystallising in the work of authors such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, represent a break with tradition and a rejection of classical beauty. The concept of reality was questioned by the new scientific theories: the subjectivity of time (Bergson), Einstein's relativity, quantum mechanics, Freud's theory of psychoanalysis, etc. On the other hand, the new technologies changed the function of art, since photography and cinema were already in charge of capturing reality. All these factors produced the genesis of the new trends in contemporary art: abstract art, action and conceptual art, ephemeral art, where the artist no longer tries to reflect reality, but his inner world, to express his feelings.
In the 20th century, movements such as futurism exalted the ephemeral nature of art, with Marinetti writing that ""nothing seems to me more base and petty than to think of immortality in creating a work of art"" (Futurism, 1911). Even the visionary architect Antonio Sant'Elia advocated building houses that ""would last less than the architects"" (Manifesto of Futurist Architecture, 1914). A new sensibility thus emerged whereby works of art acquired an autonomy of their own, evolving and transforming over time in parallel with the viewer's perception of them. In this context, the artist is merely an artificer who sets the conditions for the work to follow its own destiny.
Contemporary art is intimately linked to society, to the evolution of social concepts, such as mechanicism and the devaluation of time and beauty. It is an art that stands out for its instantaneousness, it needs little time for perception. Today's art has continuous oscillations of taste, it changes simultaneously: just as classical art was based on a metaphysics of immutable ideas, today's art, with its Kantian roots, finds taste in the social awareness of pleasure (mass culture). In a more materialistic, more consumerist society, art addresses itself to the senses, not the intellect. Thus the concept of fashion, a combination of the speed of communication and the consumerist aspect of today's civilisation, became particularly relevant. The speed of consumption wears down the work of art, causing taste to oscillate, which loses its universality and personal tastes predominate. Thus, the latest artistic trends have even lost interest in the artistic object: traditional art was an art of the object, today's art is an art of the concept. There is a revaluation of active art, of action, of spontaneous, ephemeral, non-commercial art.
Finally, it is worth remembering that the perception of the ephemeral is not appreciated in the same way in Western art as in other fields and other cultures, in the same way that not all civilisations have the same concept of art. One of the countries where the fleeting and momentary character of life and its cultural representations is most highly valued is Japan: art in Japanese culture has a great sense of introspection and of the interrelation between human beings and nature, represented equally in the objects that surround them, from the most ornate and emphatic to the most simple and everyday. This is evident in the value given to imperfection, to the ephemeral nature of things, to the emotional sense that the Japanese establish with their surroundings. Thus, for example, in the tea ceremony, the Japanese value the calm and tranquillity of this state of contemplation that they achieve with a simple ritual, based on simple elements and a harmony that comes from an asymmetrical and unfinished space. For the Japanese, peace and harmony are associated with warmth and comfort, qualities which in turn reflect their concept of beauty. Even when it comes to eating, it is not the quantity of food or its presentation that matters, but the sensory perception of the food and the aesthetic sense they attach to any act.


== Public awareness ==
Temporary art has been a way to introduce the public to art. The installation of temporary art is also used in conjunction with events or festivals. Occasionally temporary art can be used to raise public awareness or it can be used to create fleeting beauty. Occasionally it is displayed in unexpected places.
Occasionally events or festivals will invite temporary art. The 2022 International Nature and Environment Festival is coupled with a Trash Art International Festival in Gödöllő Hungary. It is an example of a film festival which invites temporary art with an environmental theme.


== Southern Hemisphere ==
The mid to late 1970s saw a flurry of ephemeral (temporary art)  conceptual art, intervention art, performance art and environmental art in New Zealand mainly centered in Wellington but also in Auckland and Christchurch largely the work of students emerging from University art schools, the National art Gallery of New Zealand and the Artists co-op.


== Notable temporary art ==

1990 Damien Hirst created a work of art or installation which could be considered temporary: It was entitled A Thousand Years, and it was a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding on a rotting cow's head.
2000's Brazilian sculptor Néle Azevedo places small human figures made of ice at landmarks. Some think the artist is making a statement about global warming. He has also used the melting figures to commemorate World War 1.
2011 sculptor Urs Fischer created an untitled wax sculpture. Over the course of five months the sculpture melted.
2015 Hungarian artist Ervin Hervé-Lóránth constructs temporary giant human figures out of polystyrene (see popped up) and calls them works of ""public surprise"".
Banksy is an example of an artist who creates temporary art. Much of it takes the form of Graffiti which is seen by many people before being removed by municipalities or ruined by other graffiti. Sometimes his works are removed by others in order to sell. A famous piece of temporary art by Banksy was a framed piece which was auctioned by Sotheby's and was shredded shortly after purchase.

Maya calendar,"The Maya calendar is a system of calendars and almanacs used in the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and in some modern Maya communities in highland Guatemala.
It is similar to calendars employed by other earlier Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Zapotec and Olmec, and contemporary or later ones such as the Mixtec and Aztec calendars. Although the Mesoamerican calendar did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements of it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood.


== Types ==
There are three main Maya calendars: the 260 day ritual calendar called Tzolk'in, the 365 day Haab', and the Long Count. Approximately 52 years pass before the Haab and Tzolkin calendars converge and are back in the same alignment. This is called the Calendar round. The Tzolk'in is still in use today by the Ixil, Kek'chi and Quiche peoples of the Guatemalan highlands.
Here is an example of a Maya calendar date: 12.18.16.2.6, 3 Cimi 4 Zotz. The “12.18.16.2.6” is the Long Count. Going from right to left, the units are: kin (1 day), uinal (20 kin = 20 days), tun (18 uinal = 360 days), katun (20 tun = approximately 20 years), baktun (20 katun  =394 years). The Long Count was used to track periods of time longer than the 52 years of the Calendar Round. The mythical starting date of the current creation was August 11, 3114 BCE (Gregorian). “3 Cimi” is the Tzolkin date. The Tzolkin date is a combination of thirteen days numbered one-thirteen and twenty day-names. “4 Zotz” is the Haab' date. The Haab' year contains 18 months (each named) with 20 days each. The number before the word is the day of that month. The Maya then added five days to the calendar after the last month, Cumku, ends, in order to make the year 365 days long. Those five days, called ""Uayeb,"" were considered to be unlucky.


== December 21, 2012 ==
A common conspiracy theory myth about the Maya calendar was that it predicted that the world would end on December 21, 2012. This belief was mistaken. According to the Maya, there were three previous worlds. The first began with “the creation of the Earth, and it had upon it vegetation and living beings. Unfortunately, because they lacked speech, the birds and animals were unable to pay homage to the gods and were destroyed. In the second and third Ages the gods created humans of mud and then wood, but these also failed to please and were wiped out. The ""zero date"" 13.0.0.0.0 on the Long Count was when, according to the Maya, the third world ended and the fourth one, the current world, began. Another 13.0.0.0.0 would occur on December 21, 2012. There is no evidence that the Long Count would end on 13.0.0.0.0 or that the Maya believed that this would be the date of the apocalypse. Still, a variety of popular books and movies have contributed to the publicity surrounding the Maya calendar's supposed prediction of the end of the world in 2012. Some believers have taken advantage of this publicity to sell guides to surviving the apocalypse.

The reason for using UBA, according to Johna Till Johnson from Nemertes Research, is that ""security systems provide so much information that it is tough to uncover information that truly indicates a potential for a real attack. Analytics tools help make sense of the vast amount of data that SIEM, IDS/IPS, system logs, and other tools gather. UBA tools use a specialized type of security analytics that focuses on the behavior of systems and the people using them. UBA technology first evolved in the field of marketing, to help companies understand and predict consumer-buying patterns. But as it turns out, UBA can be extraordinarily useful in the security context too.""


== Distinction between UBA and UEBA ==
The E in UEBA extends the analysis to include entity activities that take place but that are not necessarily directly linked or tied to a user's specific actions but that can still correlate to a vulnerability, reconnaissance, intrusion breach or exploit occurrence.
The term ""UEBA"" was coined by Gartner in 2015. UEBA tracks the activity of devices, applications, servers and data. UEBA systems produce more data and provide more complex reporting options than UBA systems.


== Difference with EDR ==
UEBA tools differ from endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities in that UEBA is an analytic focus on the user behavior whereas EDR has an analytic focus on the endpoint. Cybersecurity solutions, like EDR and XDR, typically prioritize detection and response to external threats once an incident has occurred. EUBA and IRM solutions are looking for prevent potential risks internally by analyzing employee behavior.

Pixel art,"Pixel art is a form of digital art where images are built using pixels as the only building block. It is often used in video games, but it can also be used to create other types of art, such as illustrations, animations, and even sculptures.
Pixel art is created using a variety of software programs, but some of the most popular ones include:

Aseprite
Piskel
Lospec
Pixilart
GraphicsGale
Pixel art can be created in different styles, but some of the most common ones include:

Isometric pixel art: This type of pixel art uses a 3D perspective to create images that look like they are popping out of the screen.
Animated pixel art: This type of pixel art uses multiple images to create animations.
Sprite pixel art: This type of pixel art is used to create characters and objects for video games.
Tile pixel art: This type of pixel art is used to create backgrounds and other repeating elements for video games.
Pixel art can be used to create a wide variety of images. It is a popular choice for video games because it is simple to create and can be scaled up or down without losing quality. 
Video games: Pixel art is often used in video games to create characters, objects, and backgrounds. Some classic video games that use pixel art include Mario, Pac-Man, and Sonic the Hedgehog. Newer video games that use pixel art include Minecraft and Undertale.
Illustrations:  Pixel art illustrations can be simple or complex, and they can be used to create a variety of different styles of art.
Animations: Pixel art animations can be simple or complex, and they can be used to create a variety of different types of animation, such as cartoons, GIFs, and even full-length films.
Sculptures: . Pixel art sculptures are created by stacking individual pixels together to create a three-dimensional object.",0
Local color (visual art),"In painting, local color is the color of an object when seen under flat white light with no adjustment for form shadow or colors of light or secondary light sources. An example would be the assumption that an apple is ""red"" when it is actually dependent on the color of the light hitting it, color of objects around it, glossiness, and variations within the colors on the surface of the apple itself. Local color is learned in childhood to help simplify and make sense of the world. ""The sky is blue"", ""grass is green"", etc. when there are actually myriad variations in hue, chroma, within these areas. In order to represent objects realistically, painters must look beyond the simplifications of local color. Demonstrations of color constancy show how flawed local color assumptions can be when the light source has a color shift.
In contemporary sculpture local color is the original color of the raw material that remains unpainted in the completed work.

Arson,"Arson is the act of willfully and deliberately setting fire to or charring property. Although the act of arson typically involves buildings, the term can also refer to the intentional burning of other things, such as motor vehicles, watercraft, or forests. The crime is typically classified as a felony, with instances involving risk to human life or property carrying a stricter penalty. Arson that results in death can be further prosecuted as manslaughter or murder. A common motive for arson is to commit insurance fraud. In such cases, a person destroys their own property by burning it and then lies about the cause in order to collect against their insurance policy.
A person who commits arson is referred to as an arsonist, or a serial arsonist if the person has committed arson several times. Arsonists normally use an accelerant (such as gasoline or kerosene) to ignite, propel, and direct fires, and the detection and identification of ignitable liquid residues is an important part of fire investigations. Pyromania is an impulse control disorder characterized by the pathological setting of fires. Most acts of arson are not committed by pyromaniacs.


== Etymology ==
The term derives from Law French arsoun (late 13th century), from Old French arsion, from Late Latin ārsiōnem ""a burning,"" (acc.) from the verb ardēre, ""to burn."" ""Malicious burning of property,"" 1670s, from Anglo-French arsoun (late 13c.), Old French arsion, from Late Latin arsionem (nominative arsio) ""a burning,"" noun of action from past-participle stem of Latin ardere ""to burn"" (from PIE root *as- ""to burn, glow"").
The Old English term was bærnet, lit. ""burning""; and Edward Coke has indictment of burning (1640). Arsonist is from 1864.


== English common law ==
English Common Law defines arson as ""the malicious burning of the dwelling of another.""
This definition has four elements:

Malicious
For purposes of common law arson, ""malicious"" refers to intention of starting the fire. Fires can be started on purpose or by accident. In either case, there is legal precedent charge the guilty person with arson whether their intention was to start a fire or not. ""Malicious"" in this case is describing the intention of the arsonist as ill-intentioned and intending to cause harm or death.
Burning
According to common law charring to any part of dwelling was sufficient to satisfy this element. No significant amount of damage to the dwelling was required. Any injury or damage to the structure caused by exposure to heat or flame is sufficient.
Of the dwelling
'Dwelling' refers to a place of residence. The destruction of an unoccupied building was not considered arson: ""... since arson protected habitation, the burning of an unoccupied house did not constitute arson.""  At common law a structure did not become a residence until the first occupants had moved in, and ceased to be a dwelling if the occupants abandoned the premises with no intention of resuming their residency. Dwelling includes structures and outbuildings within the curtilage. Dwellings were not limited to houses. A barn could be the subject of arson if occupied as a dwelling.
Of another
Burning one's own dwelling does not constitute common law arson, even if the purpose was to collect insurance, because ""it was generally assumed in early England that one had the legal right to destroy his own property in any manner he chose"".  Moreover, for purposes of common law arson, possession or occupancy rather than title determines whose dwelling the structure is. Thus a tenant who sets fire to his rented house would not be guilty of common law arson, while the landlord who set fire to a rented dwelling house would be guilty.


== Degrees ==
Many U.S. state legal systems and the legal systems of several other countries divide arson into degrees, depending sometimes on the value of the property but more commonly on its use and whether the crime was committed in the day or night.

First-degree arson – Burning an occupied structure such as a school or a place where people are normally present
Second-degree arson – Burning  an unoccupied building such as an empty barn or an unoccupied house or other structure in order to claim insurance on such property
Third-degree arson – Burning  an abandoned building or an abandoned area, such as a field, forest or woods.
Many statutes vary the degree of the crime according to the criminal intent of the accused. Some US states use other degrees of arson, such as ""fourth"" and ""fifth"" degree, while some states do not categorize arson by any degree. For example, in the state of Tennessee, arson is categorized as ""arson"" and ""aggravated arson.""


== Insurance fraud ==
A common motive for arson is to commit insurance fraud. In such cases, a person destroys their own property by burning it and then lies about the cause in order to collect against their insurance policy.
An example of insurance fraud being the motivating factor for an act of arson is the case for Operation Firebird. A married couple and 4 co-conspirators were arrested and convicted with arson and insurance fraud after a string of home, business, and warehouse fires which took place between 2014 and 2018 were exposed as acts of arson. Using chicken left in boiling frying oil, the convicted criminals would make fire seem like a cooking accident. Then, the group committed insurance fraud by filing insurance claims for the cost of the building, as well as, smoke-damaged goods to claim fire damages for insurance payouts. The group's scheme claimed a reported $4 million and ended when authorities were tipped off as to where the location of the next planned incident would take place. Police then performed an investigation dubbed Operation Firebird with the San Jose Fire Department. According to a 2019 Press Release from the California Department of Insurance, Tyler and Kim Chen, Ha Nguyen, Sandy Ngo, Duyen Pham, and Trang Huynh were all convicted with various degrees of arson and insurance fraud.
Tyler Chen was convicted with five separate counts of arson and two separate counts of insurance fraud in Santa Clara County in 2018. Tyler Chen's wife, Kim Chen, was convicted with two counts of insurance fraud in Santa Clara county.


== By region ==


=== United States ===

In the United States, the common law elements of arson are often varied in different jurisdictions. For example, the element of ""dwelling"" is no longer required in most states, and arson occurs by the burning of any real property without consent or with unlawful intent. Arson is prosecuted with attention to degree of severity in the alleged offense. First degree arson generally occurs when people are harmed or killed in the course of the fire, while second degree arson occurs when significant destruction of property occurs. While usually a felony, arson may also be prosecuted as a misdemeanor, ""criminal mischief"", or ""destruction of property."" Burglary also occurs, if the arson involved a ""breaking and entering"". A person may be sentenced to death if arson occurred as a method of homicide, as was the case in California of Raymond Lee Oyler and in Texas of Cameron Todd Willingham.

After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, the United States started a National Fire Prevention Week in order to educate the people on ways to prevent fires, minimize their damages, and hopefully drastically decrease casualties. Fire Prevention Week campaigns includes various information on safe cooking practices pertaining to grilling, microwaving, and cooking on a stove.
During World War II arson was a much higher concern in the United States. There was a severe lack of firefighters due to the fact most of the men were overseas to fight the war. There were few men left behind to help combat forest fires. For example, during WW II in Eldora, Iowa a fire chief reported that his regular membership shrank from 21 to 9 men and their fire fighting force recruited retired members and new members to fill the missing positions during the war. Although there were few attempts to burn U.S. forests, it continued to be a big concern due to the potential detrimental effects. This concern for arson attempts led to the rise of Smokey Bear who was the face of fire prevention and fire safety measures. Although the intention of Smokey Bear's persona is to encourage fire safety, Smokey shares a message of fire prevention which includes accidental fires that can sometimes be legally charged as arson.
In New York, arson is charged in five degrees. Arson in the first degree is a Class A-1 felony and requires the intent to burn the building with a person inside using an explosive incendiary device. In New York, the criminal charge of arson includes a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.
In California, a conviction for arson of property that is not one's own is a felony punishable by up to three years in state prison. Aggravated arson, which carries the most severe punishment for arson, is punishable by 10 years to life in state prison. A well-known example of arson which took place in California is the Esperanza Fire. Raymond Lee Oyler was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to death for a 2006 fire in southern California that led to the deaths of five U.S. Forest Service firefighters; he was the first U.S. citizen to receive such a conviction and penalty for wildfire arson.
Some states, such as California, prosecute the lesser offense of ""reckless burning"" when the fire is set recklessly as opposed to willfully and maliciously. The study of the causes is the subject of fire investigation. A recent example of a reckless burning offense is the El Dorado fire which took place in 2020 in California. This fire was caused by a gender reveal party which utilized a smoke bomb which is categorized as unsafe pyrotechnics. The El Dorado fire burned over a 71-day period, destroyed 20 structures and resulted in one firefighter fatality, for which the couple hosting the party were charged with involuntary manslaughter. The Esperanza Fire ultimately resulted in the death of firefighter Charles ""Charlie"" Morton, who became trapped while attempting to fight the fire. The DA of California considered arson charges for the family members as they were deemed negligent with regard to fire safety.


=== England ===

In English law, arson was a common law offence (except for the offence of arson in royal dockyards) dealing with the criminal destruction of buildings by fire. The common law offence was abolished by s.11(1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. The 1971 Act makes no distinction as to mode of destruction except that s.1(3) requires that if the destruction is by fire, the offence is charged as arson; s.4 of the Act provides a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for conviction under s.1 whether or not the offence is charged as arson. In Hong Kong, the common law offence was abolished by s 67 of the Crimes Ordinance 1971 (Part VIII of which, as amended by Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance 1972, mirrored the English Criminal Damage Act 1971). Like the English counterparts, 63 of the 1972 Ordinance provides a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and s 60(3) of the Ordinance requires that if the damage is by fire the offence should be charged as arson.


=== Myanmar ===
In the Burmese legal system, arson is considered ""mischief by fire"" under sections 435 and 436 of the Myanmar Penal Code and punishable by fine and imprisonment. The statutes were last amended on 1 July 2016, and made arson on houses and buildings punishable with up to 20 years in prison.
The Burmese military has long used arson as a weapon of war against civilians. From the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état to August 2022, military forces committed arson on 28,434 houses in the country.


=== Scotland ===

While the Scottish legal system has no offence known as arson statutorily defined, there are many offences that are used to charge those with acts that would normally constitute arson in other nations. Events constituting arson in English and Welsh law might be dealt with as one or more of a variety of offences such as wilful fire-raising, culpable and reckless conduct, vandalism or other offences depending on the circumstances of the event. The more serious offences (in particular wilful fire-raising and culpable and reckless conduct) can incur a sentence of life imprisonment.


=== Ireland ===
Ireland differentiates how it charges arson not by degree but rather by what is being destroyed and if anyone was harmed. For example, while the sentence for setting fire to a building can be life imprisonment, the sentence for setting fire to goods in a building can only be up to fourteen years.[1]
A notable historical act of arson in Ireland is the burning of Wildgoose Lodge, which resulted in the arrest, sentencing, and execution of 18 men, many of whom were innocent. More recently, the 2023 Dublin riot involved instances of arson, with many such acts targeting vehicles.


== Notable arsonists ==

Herostratus, accused of setting fire to the Temple of Artemis in 356 BCE.
Zayd ibn Musa al-Kazim, was characterized a pogrom against the supporters of the Abbasids in 815 and 816, which earned him the nickname Zayd al-Nar ('Zayd of the Fire') due to the large numbers of houses belonging to Abbasid family members or their followers that he torched.
Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, Irish nobleman and soldier, known as Murchadh na dTóiteán (""Murrough the Burner"") for his role in the Sack of Cashel and other similar atrocities during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.
Margaret Clark set a home on fire in London in 1680.
David Berkowitz, American serial killer who was also implicated in many unsolved arsons in the New York City in the 1970s.
Peter Dinsdale, confessed to a total of 11 acts of arson, pleading guilty to 26 counts of manslaughter. The fires were set from 1972 to 1979.
John Leonard Orr, as arson investigator for the Glendale, CA fire department who set over 2,000 Los Angeles fires from 1984 to 1991.
Julio González, the perpetrator behind the Happy Land Fire killed 87 in 1990, likely as revenge against his ex-girlfriend.
Paul Kenneth Keller, convicted of setting over 107 fires in 1992 and 1993.
John Magno and several others were responsible for the Woodbine Building Supply fire in 2001.
Thomas Sweatt, set over 350 fires in and around Washington, D.C., most of which occurred in 2003 and 2004.
Raymond Lee Oyler, set the Esparanza Fire which burned over 41,000 acres of land, in 2006.
Benjamin Christensen, volunteer firefighter from Pennsylvania responsible for setting seven fires from 2007 to 2008.
Francisco Ignacio Mondaca and Francisco Pinto were responsible for starting the 2024 Chile wildfires that killed 137 people.

Automated teller machine,"An automated teller machine (ATM) is a machine that lets people take or deposit money that they have. It can also be used by someone to see how much money they have, or see and do other things with their bank account. In the United Kingdom, ATMs are often called cash machines, cashpoints or the hole in the wall.
ATMs may be found in stores and shopping malls. They can also be found in other places. Sometimes, they can be found in bars or restaurants. Other times, at special events, people may set one up so the guests can use the machine, like at a fundraiser.
People need a debit card or credit card in order to use an ATM. They also need a personal identification number (PIN). A PIN is a code that lets them get into their account.
There are many scams with ATMs. In one scam, con artists look over the victim's shoulder and find their PIN. This is known as shoulder surfing. In another, they may put a video camera near the ATM to look at people using their PIN number. They then make cards using the PIN number and account number to be able to use that person's account.
In Germany, where people still use real money more than electronic money, there have been a lot of robberies from cash machines. 496 cash machines were blown up in 2022, with about €100,000 stolen each time.  Most of the thieves are Dutch men, say the German police.
In Japan old people are targeted by people who pretend to be members of their family in trouble.  In 2023 the National Police Agency were thinking about stopping people over 65 who had not used a machine for more than a year from using them.

Certified wood,"Certified wood and paper products come from responsibly managed forests – as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent standards setting organization (SSO) develops standards for good forest management, and independent auditing companies issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.


== Requirements ==
Forest certification programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:
Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:

Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation).
Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies.
Publicly available certification audit summaries.
Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards setting development process.
Complaints and appeals process.


== Programs ==
ISO members rejected a proposal for a forestry management system as requirements standard, with a consensus that a management system for certification would not be effective. Instead ISO members voted for a chain of custody of wood and wood-based products with ISO 38200 published in 2018. Without a single international standard for forestry management certification, there are a proliferation of private standards, with more than 50 scheme owners offering certification programs worldwide  addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). The Forest Stewardship Council's Policy on Conversion states that land areas converted from natural forests to round wood production after November 1994 are ineligible for Forest Stewardship Council certification.
The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing. In 2021, PEFC issued a position statement defending their use of private standards in response to the Destruction: Certified report from Greenpeace.
Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between environmental NGOs, forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including Jared Diamond, have suggested that many competing private standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.
There are two varieties of forest certification:

forest management certification, which determines if forests are maintained in accordance with a set of criteria;
chain of custody certification, which ensures that certified material is identified or kept separate from non-certified or non-controlled material throughout the manufacturing process and is traceable from the forest to the ultimate customer.


=== United States and Canada ===
In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the American Tree Farm System (ATFS), the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Standard and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. SFI is the world's largest single forest certification standard by area. The FSC, program is applied throughout North America. 
The National Association of State Foresters in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports all of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: ""... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs."".
The Canadian Council of Forest Ministers issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: ""In Canada, each jurisdiction's forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an over-arching framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada's forest management laws, and to document the country's world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and SFI are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.""


== Chain-of-custody certification ==
Chain of custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.
The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates). There are over 600 organizations certified to the SFI Chain-of-Custody Standard, and SFI-certified products are sold in more than 120 countries around the world. 


== Future expansion ==
Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world's forest under at least one certification program. Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.
Third-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.
The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:

Paper, publishing, printing and packaging – commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc. has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification.
Green public procurement – governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK's Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest).
Green building – standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products.
Illegal logging – new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns.
The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.

Antivirus software,"Antivirus software helps protect a computer system from computer malware. Viruses, worms or trojan horses can be used by criminals or hackers. They can steal information or damage system files. If no antivirus software is installed, hackers will be able to access the information in the computer.


== Types ==
There are many different types of antivirus software. Many antivirus programs can be downloaded for free. These free antiviruses usually have some features missing. The missing features are only available to people who buy the full version. Many free antiviruses have great virus scanning capabilities and can give people suitable internet security protections without the need to buying additional protections.


== Features ==
Antivirus software protects computers in many different ways. Most antiviruses offer more than just ""virus"" protection. They protect computers from all different kinds of malware, like spyware, rootkits, phishing, and ransomware. Antiviruses are often referred to as ""anti-malware"" programs. There are  several ways that antiviruses protect against malware. The most used way is through a regular scan of all the data and files on a computer's hard disk. In an antivirus scan, the software will look through every file on a computer It compares each computer file's genetic makeup with the genetic makeup of already-known viruses. If a file has the same genetic makeup as a known piece of malware, it will be flagged as a problem. This is known as signature-based detection. It is only effective when a malware file has been previously identified and shared with the community of malware researchers who maintain the malware database. Another typical kind of malware detection is through behavior analysis. This is when the antivirus software identifies an abnormal behavior in a computer file or program. It makes the antivirus to flag that issue and assess whether or not the abnormality has been caused by malware or by something else.


== Problems with antivirus software ==
Most tests and experts claim that while antivirus software is extremely useful in preventing some cyber attacks, it is unable to stop all attacks. That is because once a piece of malware has been identified, hackers know that this malware will be added to the list of already-known viruses, and it will no longer be able to pass through most signature-based detection systems. Also, antivirus software is not completely perfect, and there are more new and emerging threats that mostly sneak by a computer's defenses.
Installing more than one antivirus is never a good idea. The two different antivirus software may interfere with each other and causes damage.
Sometimes antivirus software sees viruses in files that do not actually have viruses. This is called a false positive.  The antivirus software will may remove files from the computer that do not have to be removed. This may cause other programs to not work correctly.

Radio astronomy,"Radio astronomy is astronomy which studies celestial objects at radio frequencies. 
The first detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was made in the 1930s. Karl Jansky found radiation coming from the Milky Way. Later, other sources of radio emission were found. These include stars and galaxies, as well as entirely new classes of objects, such as radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars,  and masers. 
The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, evidence for the Big Bang theory, was made through radio astronomy.
Radio astronomy is done using large radio antennas. These are called radio telescopes. They are used alone, or with multiple linked telescopes. The use of interferometry allows radio astronomy to achieve high angular resolution. The resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components, not the size of its components.

Huihui Lifa,"The Huihui Lifa (Traditional Chinese: 回回歷法; Simplified Chinese: 回回历法; pinyin: Huíhuí Lìfǎ) was a set of astronomical tables published throughout China from the time of the Ming Dynasty in the late 14th century through the early 18th century. The tables were based on a translation into Chinese of the Zij (Islamic astronomical tables), the title Huihui Lifa literally meaning ""Muslim System of Calendar Astronomy"".


== History ==
Around 1384, during the Ming Dynasty, Hongwu Emperor ordered the Chinese translation and compilation of Islamic astronomical tables, a task that was carried out by the scholars Mashayihei (مشایخی), a Muslim astronomer, and Wu Bozong, a Chinese scholar-official.
These tables came to be known as the Huihui Lifa (Muslim System of Calendrical Astronomy), and were published in China a number of times until the early 18th century, despite the fact the Qing Dynasty had officially abandoned the tradition of Chinese-Islamic astronomy in 1659.


== Study of the Huihui Lifa in Korea ==

In the early Joseon period, the Islamic calendar served as a basis for calendar reform owing to its superior accuracy over the existing Chinese-based calendars. A Korean translation of the Huihui Lifa was studied in Korea under the Joseon Dynasty during the time of Sejong in the 15th century. The tradition of Chinese-Islamic astronomy survived in Korea until the early 19th century.

Diffusion flame,"In combustion, a diffusion flame is a flame in which the oxidizer and fuel are separated before burning. Contrary to its name, a diffusion flame involves both diffusion and convection processes. The name diffusion flame was first suggested by S.P. Burke and T.E.W. Schumann in 1928, to differentiate from premixed flame where fuel and oxidizer are premixed prior to burning. The diffusion flame is also referred to as nonpremixed flame. The burning rate is however still limited by the rate of diffusion. Diffusion flames tend to burn slower and to produce more soot than premixed flames because there may not be sufficient oxidizer for the reaction to go to completion, although there are some exceptions to the rule. The soot typically produced in a diffusion flame becomes incandescent from the heat of the flame and lends the flame its readily identifiable orange-yellow color. Diffusion flames tend to have a less-localized flame front than premixed flames.
The contexts for diffusion may vary somewhat. For instance, a candle uses the heat of the flame itself to vaporize its wax fuel and the oxidizer (oxygen) diffuses into the flame from the surrounding air, while a gaslight flame (or the safety flame of a Bunsen burner) uses fuel already in the form of a vapor.
Diffusion flames are often studied in counter flow (also called opposed jet) burners. Their interest is due to possible application in the flamelet model for turbulent combustion. Furthermore they provide a convenient way to examine strained flames and flames with holes. These are also known under the name of ""edge flames"", characterized by a local extinction on their axis because of the high strain rates in the vicinity of the stagnation point.
Diffusion flames have an entirely different appearance in a microgravity environment.  There is no convection to carry the hot combustion products away from the fuel source, which results in a spherical flame front, such as in the candle seen here. This is a rare example of a diffusion flame which does not produce much soot and does not therefore have a typical yellow flame.

Scheitholz,"Scheitholz is a German term for any log sections that have been split lengthways with an axe or log splitter and that are primarily used for firewood or the manufacture of wood shingles. The individual pieces of timber are called Holzscheite (obs.: Holzscheiter), derived from the Old High German word scît = ""piece"". Scheitholz boilers are used to burn quantities of Scheithölzer. The expression ""auf Scheitholz knien"" (""to kneel on scheitholz) was a disciplinary measure used in times when corporal punishment in schools was still permitted.
Very thinly split timber is also called Spanholz or Span, roughly the same as long-fibred wood chips or wood shavings, which may also be a waste by-product of the processes of planning or hewing wood. Span may also refer, however, to long-fibred slips or slices of wood especially of poplar and other softwoods, which are used to make wooden punnets and fruit or vegetable crates.

Software versioning,"Software versioning is a way to name different versions of computer software. A computer software has different states in its life-cycle process from development through deployment into production and sustainment. Each state in the process is given a unique version and version number. Versions are most often a sequence of one to four numbers (for example, 12.2.3) to represent Major.Minor.Maintenance actions, but they can also use names, dates, or other sequencing mechanisms.  In some practices, the numbers are used with variations like the 3rd digit being replaced by a letter (for example, 4.1a).  The changes are all revisions in that something is being changed and the version number tells people how complex the change is to the software.
Many times, after a program has been made, things called patches can be downloaded from the program's website. The patches usually make small updates or fixes to the main program, such as fixing bugs or updating information or program functions. When a patch is used, the program is advanced to the next version, advancing the version number by the appropriate level.",0

Unified Modeling Language,"The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering. UML is used to provide a standard way to show what the design of a system looks like.
UML was originally developed to standardize the different notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and James Rumbaugh at Rational Software in 1994–95, with further development led by them through 1996.
In 1997, UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 the Unified Modeling Language was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard.
There are different types of diagrams, which serve different purposes:

That way, business analysts can agree on the design of a system, for example by showing use-case diagrams
Software developers can show activity diagrams, to expalin what the software does at a given moment, or how a certain operatio is structured.
System engineers can rol out the software, and describe their work in a deployment diagram.
UML is mostly about diagrams, and finding a common language to describe these diagrams.",0
Wood drying,"Wood drying (also seasoning lumber or wood seasoning) reduces the moisture content of wood before its use. When the drying is done in a kiln, the product is known as kiln-dried timber or lumber, whereas air drying is the more traditional method.
There are two main reasons for drying wood:

Woodworking
When wood is used as a construction material, whether as a structural support in a building or in woodworking objects, it will absorb or expel moisture until it is in equilibrium with its surroundings. Equilibration (usually drying) causes unequal shrinkage in the wood, and can cause damage to the wood if equilibration occurs too rapidly. The equilibration must be controlled to prevent damage to the wood.
Wood burning
When wood is burned (firewood), it is usually best to dry it first. Damage from shrinkage is not a problem here, as it may be in the case of drying for woodworking purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons going up the chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100 °C exhaust temperature, about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning wet wood is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.

For some purposes, wood is not dried at all, and is used green. Often, wood must be in equilibrium with the air outside, as for construction wood, or the air indoors, as for wooden furniture.
Wood is air-dried or dried in a purpose built oven (kiln). Usually the wood is sawn before drying, but sometimes the log is dried whole.

Case hardening describes lumber or timber that has been dried too rapidly. Wood initially dries from the shell (surface), shrinking the shell and putting the core under compression. When this shell is at a low moisture content it will 'set' and resist shrinkage. The core of the wood is still at a higher moisture content. This core will then begin to dry and shrink. However, any shrinkage is resisted by the already 'set' shell. This leads to reversed stresses; compression stresses on the shell and tension stresses in the core. This results in unrelieved stress called case hardening. Case-hardened [wood] may warp considerably and dangerously when the stress is released by sawing.


== Types of wood ==
Wood is divided, according to its botanical origin, into two kinds: softwoods, from coniferous trees, and hardwoods, from broad-leaved trees. Softwoods are lighter and generally simple in structure, whereas hardwoods are harder and more complex. However, in Australia, softwood generally describes rain forest trees, and hardwood describes Sclerophyll species (Eucalyptus spp).
Softwoods such as pine are typically much lighter and easier to process than hardwoods such as fruit tree wood. The density of softwoods ranges from 350 kg/m3 to 700 kg/m3, while hardwoods are 450 kg/m3 to 1250 kg/m3. Once dried, both consist of approximately 12% of moisture (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996). Because of hardwood's denser and more complex structure, its permeability is much less than that of softwood, making it more difficult to dry. Although there are about a hundred times more species of hardwood trees than softwood trees, the ability to be dried and processed faster and more easily makes softwood the main supply of commercial wood nowadays.


== Wood–water relationships ==

The timber of living trees and fresh logs contains a large amount of water which often constitutes over 50% of the wood's weight. Water has a significant influence on wood. Wood continually exchanges moisture or water with its surroundings, although the rate of exchange is strongly affected by the degree to which wood is sealed.
Wood contains water in three forms:

Free water
The bulk of water contained in the cell lumina is only held by capillary forces. It is not bound chemically and is called free water. Free water is not in the same thermodynamic state as liquid water: energy is required to overcome the capillary forces. Furthermore, free water may contain chemicals, altering the drying characteristics of wood.
Bound or hygroscopic water
Bound water is bound to the wood via hydrogen bonds. The attraction of wood for water arises from the presence of free hydroxyl (OH) groups in the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin molecules in the cell wall. The hydroxyl groups are negatively charged. Because water is a polar liquid, the free hydroxyl groups in cellulose attract and hold water by hydrogen bonding.
Vapor
Water in cell lumina in the form of water vapour is normally negligible at normal temperature and humidity.


=== Moisture content ===
The moisture content of wood is calculated as the mass change as a proportion of the dry mass, by the formula (Siau, 1984):

  
    
      
        
          moisture content
        
        =

 is its oven dry mass (the attainment of constant mass generally after drying in an oven set at 103±2 °C (218±4 °F) for 24 hours as mentioned by Walker et al., 1993). The equation can also be expressed as a fraction of the mass of the water and the mass of the oven dry wood rather than a percentage. For example, 0.59 kg/kg (oven dry basis) expresses the same moisture content as 59% (oven dry basis).


=== Fibre saturation point ===

When green wood dries, free water from the cell lumina, held by the capillary forces only, is the first to go. Physical properties, such as strength and shrinkage, are generally not affected by the removal of free water. The fibre saturation point (FSP) is defined as the moisture content at which free water should be completely gone, while the cell walls are saturated with bound water. In most types of woods, the fibre saturation point is at 25 to 30% moisture content. Siau (1984) reported that the fibre saturation point

            fsp

    {\displaystyle X_{\text{fsp}}=0.30-(T-20C)/1000K\;}
  
 (1.2)
Keey et al. (2000) use a different definition of the fibre saturation point (equilibrium moisture content of wood in an environment of 99% relative humidity).
Many properties of wood show considerable change as the wood is dried below the fibre saturation point, including:

volume (ideally no shrinkage occurs until some bound water is lost, that is, until wood is dried below FSP);
strength (strengths generally increase consistently as the wood is dried below the FSP (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996), except for impact-bending strength and, in some cases, toughness);
electrical resistivity, which increases very rapidly with the loss of bound water when the wood dries below the FSP.


=== Equilibrium moisture content ===

Wood is a hygroscopic substance. It has the ability to take in or give off moisture in the form of vapour. Water contained in wood exerts vapour pressure of its own, which is determined by the maximum size of the capillaries filled with water at any time. If water vapour pressure in the ambient space is lower than vapour pressure within wood, desorption takes place. The largest-sized capillaries, which are full of water at the time, empty first. Vapour pressure within the wood falls as water is successively contained in smaller capillaries. A stage is eventually reached when vapour pressure within the wood equals vapour pressure in the ambient space above the wood, and further desorption ceases. The amount of moisture that remains in the wood at this stage is in equilibrium with water vapour pressure in the ambient space, and is termed the equilibrium moisture content or EMC (Siau, 1984). Because of its hygroscopicity, wood tends to reach a moisture content that is in equilibrium with the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding air.

The EMC of wood varies with the ambient relative humidity (a function of temperature) significantly, to a lesser degree with the temperature. Siau (1984) reported that the EMC also varies very slightly with species, mechanical stress, drying history of wood, density, extractives content and the direction of sorption in which the moisture change takes place (i.e. adsorption or desorption).


=== Moisture content of wood in service ===
Wood retains its hygroscopic characteristics after it is put into use. It is then subjected to fluctuating humidity, the dominant factor in determining its EMC. These fluctuations may be more or less cyclical, such as diurnal changes or annual seasonal changes.
To minimize the changes in wood moisture content or the movement of wooden objects in service, wood is usually dried to a moisture content that is close to the average EMC conditions to which it will be exposed. These conditions vary for interior uses compared with exterior uses in a given geographic location. For example, according to the Australian Standard for Timber Drying Quality (AS/NZS 4787, 2001), the EMC is recommended to be 10–12% for the majority of Australian states, although extreme cases are up to 15 to 18% for some places in Queensland, Northern Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania. However, the EMC is as low as 6 to 7% in dry centrally heated houses and offices or in permanently air-conditioned buildings.


=== Shrinkage and swelling ===
Shrinkage and swelling may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume change is not equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the tangential direction and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker et al., 1993).
Differential transverse shrinkage of wood is related to:

the alternation of late wood and early wood increments within the annual ring;
the influence of wood rays on the radial direction (Kollmann and Cote, 1968);
the features of the cell wall structure such as microfibril angle modifications and pits;
the chemical composition of the middle lamella.

Wood drying may be described as the art of ensuring that gross dimensional changes through shrinkage are confined to the drying process. Ideally, wood is dried to that equilibrium moisture content as will later (in service) be attained by the wood. Thus, further dimensional change will be kept to a minimum.
It is probably impossible to completely eliminate dimensional change in wood, but elimination of change in size may be approximated by chemical modification. For example, wood can be treated with chemicals to replace the hydroxyl groups with other hydrophobic functional groups of modifying agents (Stamm, 1964). Among all the existing processes, wood modification with acetic anhydride has been noted for the high anti-shrink or anti-swell efficiency (ASE) attainable without damage to wood. However, acetylation of wood has been slow to be commercialised due to the cost, corrosion and the entrapment of the acetic acid in wood. There is an extensive volume of literature relating to the chemical modification of wood (Rowell, 1983, 1991; Kumar, 1994; Haque, 1997).
Drying timber is one method of adding value to sawn products from the primary wood processing industries. According to the Australian Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation (FWPRDC), green sawn hardwood, which is sold at about $350 per cubic metre or less, increases in value to $2,000 per cubic metre or more with drying and processing. However, currently used conventional drying processes often result in significant quality problems from cracks, both externally and internally, reducing the value of the product. For example, in Queensland (Anon, 1997), on the assumption that 10% of the dried softwood is devalued by $200 per cubic metre because of drying defects, saw millers are losing about $5 million a year. In Australia, the loss could be $40 million a year for softwood and an equal or higher amount for hardwood. Thus, proper drying under controlled conditions prior to use is of great importance in timber use, in countries where climatic conditions vary considerably at different times of the year. 
Drying, if carried out promptly after felling of trees, also protects timber against primary decay, fungal stain and attack by certain kinds of insects. Organisms, which cause decay and stain, generally cannot thrive in timber with a moisture content below 20%. Several, though not all, insect pests can live only in green timber.
In addition to the above advantages of drying timber, the following points are also significant (Walker et al., 1993; Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996):

Dried timber is lighter, and the transportation and handling costs are reduced.
Dried timber is stronger than green timber in most strength properties.
Timbers for impregnation with preservatives have to be properly dried if proper penetration is to be accomplished, particularly in the case of oil-type preservatives.
In the field of chemical modification of wood and wood products, the material should be dried to a certain moisture content for the appropriate reactions to occur.
Dry wood generally works, machines, finishes and glues better than green timber (although there are exceptions; for instance, green wood is often easier to turn than dry wood). Paints and finishes last longer on dry timber.
The electrical and thermal insulation properties of wood are improved by drying.
Prompt drying of wood immediately after felling therefore significantly upgrades and adds value to raw timber. Drying enables substantial long-term economy by rationalizing the use of timber resources. The drying of wood is thus an area for research and development, which concern many researchers and timber companies around the world.


=== Mechanisms of moisture movement ===
Water in wood normally moves from zones of higher to zones of lower moisture content (Walker et al., 1993). Drying starts from the exterior of the wood and moves towards the centre, and drying at the outside is also necessary to expel moisture from the inner zones of the wood. Wood subsequently attains equilibrium with the surrounding air in moisture content.


==== Moisture passageways ====
The driving force of moisture movement is chemical potential. However, it is not always easy to relate chemical potential in wood to commonly observable variables, such as temperature and moisture content (Keey et al., 2000). Moisture in wood moves within the wood as liquid or vapour through several types of passageways, based on the nature of the driving force, (e.g. pressure or moisture gradient), and variations in wood structure (Langrish and Walker, 1993), as explained in the next section on driving forces for moisture movement. These pathways consist of cavities of the vessels, fibres, ray cells, pit chambers and their pit membrane openings, intercellular spaces and transitory cell wall passageways.
Movement of water takes place in these passageways in any direction, longitudinally in the cells, as well as laterally from cell to cell until it reaches the lateral drying surfaces of the wood. The higher longitudinal permeability of sapwood of hardwood is generally caused by the presence of vessels. The lateral permeability and transverse flow is often very low in hardwoods. The vessels in hardwoods are sometimes blocked by the presence of tyloses and/or by secreting gums and resins in some other species, as mentioned earlier. The presence of gum veins, the formation of which is often a result of natural protective response of trees to injury, is commonly observed on the surface of sawn boards of most eucalypts. Despite the generally higher volume fraction of rays in hardwoods (typically 15% of wood volume), the rays are not particularly effective in radial flow, nor are the pits on the radial surfaces of fibres effective in tangential flow (Langrish and Walker, 1993).


==== Moisture movement space ====
The available space for air and moisture in wood depends on the density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity is reported to be 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability is a measure of the ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.


=== Driving forces for moisture movement ===
Three main driving forces used in different version of diffusion models are moisture content, the partial pressure of water vapour, and the chemical potential of water (Skaar, 1988; Keey et al., 2000). These are discussed here, including capillary action, which is a mechanism for free water transport in permeable softwoods. Total pressure difference is the driving force during wood vacuum drying.


==== Capillary action ====
Capillary forces determine the movements (or absence of movement) of free water. It is due to both adhesion and cohesion. Adhesion is the attraction between water to other substances and cohesion is the attraction of the molecules in water to each other.
As wood dries, evaporation of water from the surface sets up capillary forces that exert a pull on the free water in the zones of wood beneath the surfaces. When there is no longer any free water in the wood capillary forces are no longer of importance.


==== Moisture content differences ====
The chemical potential is explained here since it is the true driving force for the transport of water in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the chemical potential of that substance (Skaar, 1933). The chemical potential of water in unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium will occur at the equilibrium moisture content (as defined earlier) of wood when the chemical potential of water in the wood becomes equal to that in the surrounding air. The chemical potential of sorbed water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of water activity, is accompanied by a gradient of chemical potential under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until its chemical potential is uniform throughout, resulting in a zero potential gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in its chemical potential, and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey et al., 2000).
The gradient in chemical potential is related to the moisture content gradient as explained in above equations (Keey et al., 2000). The diffusion model using the moisture content gradient as a driving force was applied successfully by Wu (1989) and Doe et al. (1994). Though the agreement between the moisture-content profiles predicted by the diffusion model based on moisture-content gradients is better at lower moisture contents than at higher ones, there is no evidence to suggest that there are significantly different moisture-transport mechanisms operating at higher moisture contents for this timber. Their observations are consistent with a transport process that is driven by the total concentration of water. The diffusion model is used here based on this empirical evidence that the moisture-content gradient is a driving force for drying this type of impermeable timber.
Differences in moisture content between the surface and the centre (gradient, the chemical potential difference between interface and bulk) move the bound water through the small passageways in the cell wall by diffusion. In comparison with capillary movement, diffusion is a slow process. Diffusion is the generally suggested mechanism for the drying of impermeable hardwoods (Keey et al., 2000). Furthermore, moisture migrates slowly due to the fact that extractives plug the small cell wall openings in the heartwood. This is why sapwood generally dries faster than heartwood under the same drying conditions.


==== Moisture movement directions for diffusion ====
It is reported that the ratio of the longitudinal to the transverse (radial and tangential) diffusion rates for wood ranges from about 100 at a moisture content of 5%, to 2–4 at a moisture content of 25% (Langrish and Walker, 1993). Radial diffusion is somewhat faster than tangential diffusion. Although longitudinal diffusion is most rapid, it is of practical importance only when short pieces are dried. Generally the timber boards are much longer than in width or thickness. For example, a typical size of a green board used for this research was 6 m long, 250 mm in width and 43 mm in thickness. If the boards are quartersawn, then the width will be in the radial direction whereas the thickness will be in tangential direction, and vice versa for plain-sawn boards. Most of the moisture is removed from wood by lateral movement during drying.


=== Reasons for splits and cracks during timber drying and their control ===
The chief difficulty experienced in the drying of timber is the tendency of its outer layers to dry out more rapidly than the interior ones. If these layers are allowed to dry much below the fibre saturation point while the interior is still saturated, stresses (called drying stresses) are set up because the shrinkage of the outer layers is restricted by the wet interior (Keey et al., 2000). Rupture in the wood tissues occurs, and consequently splits and cracks occur if these stresses across the grain exceed the strength across the grain (fibre to fibre bonding).
The successful control of drying defects in a drying process consists in maintaining a balance between the rate of evaporation of moisture from the surface and the rate of outward movement of moisture from the interior of the wood. The way in which drying can be controlled will now be explained. One of the most successful ways of wood drying or seasoning would be kiln drying, where the wood is placed into a kiln compartment in stacks and dried by steaming, and releasing the steam slowly.


=== Influence of temperature, relative humidity and rate of air circulation ===
The external drying conditions (temperature, relative humidity and air velocity) control the external boundary conditions for drying, and hence the drying rate, as well as affecting the rate of internal moisture movement. The drying rate is affected by external drying conditions (Walker et al., 1993; Keey et al., 2000), as will now be described.

Temperature
If the relative humidity is kept constant, the higher the temperature, the higher the drying rate. Temperature influences the drying rate by increasing the moisture holding capacity of the air, as well as by accelerating the diffusion rate of moisture through the wood. The actual temperature in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), which is the temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) is defined as the temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2 m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100 °C and wet-bulb temperature 60 °C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.
Relative humidity
The relative humidity of air is defined as the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated vapour pressure at the same temperature and total pressure (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased moisture gradient in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the relative humidity of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the absolute humidity, which is the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air). However, its influenced by the amount of water in the heated air.
Air circulation rate
Drying time and timber quality depend on the air velocity and its uniform circulation. At a constant temperature and relative humidity, the highest possible drying rate is obtained by rapid circulation of air across the surface of wood, giving rapid removal of moisture evaporating from the wood. However, a higher drying rate is not always desirable, particularly for impermeable hardwoods, because higher drying rates develop greater stresses that may cause the timber to crack or distort. At very low fan speeds, less than 1 m/s, the air flow through the stack is often laminar flow, and the heat transfer between the timber surface and the moving air stream is not particularly effective (Walker et al., 1993). The low effectiveness (externally) of heat transfer is not necessarily a problem if internal moisture movement is the key limitation to the movement of moisture, as it is for most hardwoods (Pordage and Langrish, 1999).


=== Classification of timbers for drying ===
The timbers are classified as follows according to their ease of drying and their proneness to drying degrade:

Highly refractory woods
These woods are slow and difficult to dry if the final product is to be free from defects, particularly cracks and splits. Examples are heavy structural timbers with high density such as ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata), blackbutt (E. pillularis), southern blue gum (E. globulus) and brush box (Lophostemon cofertus). They require considerable protection and care against rapid drying conditions for the best results (Bootle, 1994).
Moderately refractory woods
These timbers show a moderate tendency to crack and split during seasoning. They can be seasoned free from defects with moderately rapid drying conditions (i.e. a maximum dry-bulb temperature of 85 °C can be used). Examples are Sydney blue gum (E. saligna) and other timbers of medium density (Bootle, 1994), which are potentially suitable for furniture.
Non-refractory woods
These woods can be rapidly seasoned to be free from defects even by applying high temperatures (dry-bulb temperatures of more than 100 °C) in industrial kilns. If not dried rapidly, they may develop discolouration (blue stain) and mould on the surface. Examples are softwoods and low density timbers such as Pinus radiata.


=== Model ===
The rate at which wood dries depends upon a number of factors, the most important of which are the temperature, the dimensions of the wood, and the relative humidity. Simpson and Tschernitz have developed a simple model of wood drying as a function of these three variables. Although the analysis was done for red oak, the procedure may be applied to any species of wood by adjusting the constant parameters of the model.
Simply put, the model assumes that the rate of change of the moisture content M with respect to time t is proportional to how far the wood sample is from its equilibrium moisture content

Sarcophagus,"A sarcophagus (pl.: sarcophagi or sarcophaguses) is a coffin, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word sarcophagus comes from the Greek σάρξ sarx meaning ""flesh"", and φαγεῖν phagein meaning ""to eat""; hence sarcophagus means ""flesh-eating"", from the phrase lithos sarkophagos (λίθος σαρκοφάγος), ""flesh-eating stone"". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to rapidly facilitate the decomposition of the flesh of corpses contained within it due to the chemical properties of the limestone itself.


== History of the sarcophagus ==
Sarcophagi were most often designed to remain above ground. The earliest stone sarcophagi were used by Egyptian pharaohs of the 3rd dynasty, which reigned from about 2686 to 2613 BC.
The Hagia Triada sarcophagus is a stone sarcophagus elaborately painted in fresco; one style of later Ancient Greek sarcophagus in painted pottery is seen in Klazomenian sarcophagi, produced around the Ionian Greek city of Klazomenai, where most examples were found, between 550 BC (Late Archaic) and 470 BC. They are made of coarse clay in shades of brown to pink. Added to the basin-like main sarcophagus is a broad, rectangular frame, often covered with a white slip and then painted. The huge Lycian Tomb of Payava, now in the British Museum, is a royal tomb monument of about 360 BC designed for an open-air placing, a grand example of a common Lycian style.

Ancient Roman sarcophagi—sometimes metal or plaster as well as limestone—were popular from about the reign of Trajan, and often elaborately carved, until the early Christian burial preference for interment underground, often in a limestone sepulchre, led to their falling out of favor. However, there are many important Early Christian sarcophagi from the 3rd to 4th centuries. Most Roman examples were designed to be placed against a wall and are decorated on three sides only. Sarcophagi continued to be used in Christian Europe for important figures, especially rulers and leading church figures, and by the High Middle Ages often had a recumbent tomb effigy lying on the lid. More plain sarcophagi were placed in crypts. The most famous examples include the Habsburg Imperial Crypt in Vienna, Austria. The term tends to be less often used to describe Medieval, Renaissance, and later examples.
In the early modern period, lack of space tended to make sarcophagi impractical in churches, but chest tombs or false sarcophagi, empty and usually bottomless cases placed over an underground burial, became popular in outside locations such as cemeteries and churchyards, especially in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, where memorials were mostly not highly decorated and the extra cost of a false sarcophagus over a headstone acted as an indication of social status.


== United States ==

Sarcophagi, usually ""false"", made a return to the cemeteries of America during the last quarter of the 19th century, at which time, according to a New York company which built sarcophagi, ""it was decidedly the most prevalent of all memorials in our cemeteries"". They continued to be popular into the 1950s, at which time the popularity of flat memorials (making for easier grounds maintenance) made them obsolete. Nonetheless, a 1952 catalog from the memorial industry still included eight pages of them, broken down into Georgian and Classical detail, a Gothic and Renaissance adaptation, and a Modern variant. The image shows sarcophagi from the late 19th century located in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The one in the back, the Warner Monument created by Alexander Milne Calder (1879), features the spirit or soul of the deceased being released.


== Asia ==
In the Mekong Delta in southwestern Vietnam, it is common for families to inter their members in sarcophagi near their homes, thus allowing ready access for visits as a part of the indigenous tradition of ancestor worship.
In Sulawesi, Indonesia, waruga are a traditional form of sarcophagus.


== India ==
Nearly 140 years after British archaeologist Alexander Rea unearthed a sarcophagus from the hillocks of Pallavaram in Tamil Nadu, an identical artifact dating back by more than 2,000 years has been discovered in the same locality.


== Spain ==
Phoenician and Paleochristian sarcophagi have been found in the Iberian Peninsula.

Studio glass,"Studio glass is the modern use of glass as an artistic medium to produce sculptures or three-dimensional artworks in the fine arts.  The glass objects created are intended to make a sculptural or decorative statement, and typically serve no useful function. Though usage varies, the term is properly restricted to glass made as art in small workshops, typically with the personal involvement of the artist who designed the piece.  This is in contrast to art glass, made by craftsmen in factories, and glass art, covering the whole range of glass with artistic interest made throughout history.   Both art glass and studio glass originate in the 19th century, and the terms compare with studio pottery and art pottery, but in glass the term ""studio glass"" is mostly used for work made in the period beginning in the 1960s with a major revival in interest in artistic glassmaking.
Pieces are often unique, or made in a small limited edition. Their prices may range from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of dollars (US).  For the largest installations, the prices are in the millions.
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating glass artworks, including:

Glassblowing,
Flameworking,
Glass casting,
Coldworking,
Glass fusing,
Pâte de verre,
Stained glass.


== History ==

From the 19th century, various types of fancy glass started to become significant branches of the decorative arts. Cameo glass was revived for the first time since the Romans, initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style. The Art Nouveau movement in particular made great use of glass, with René Lalique, Émile Gallé, and Daum of Nancy important names in the first French wave of the movement, producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using lustre techniques. Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in secular stained glass, mostly of plant subjects, both in panels and his famous lamps. From the 20th century, some glass artists began to class themselves as sculptors working in glass and as part of the fine arts.
In the early 20th century, most glass production happened in factories. Even individual glassblowers making their own personalized designs would do their work in those large shared buildings. The idea of ""art glass"" grew – small decorative works in small production runs, often with designs or objects inside.

By the 1970s, there were good designs for smaller furnaces, and in the United States this gave rise to the ""studio glass"" movement of glassblowers, who worked outside of factories, often in their own buildings or studios. This coincided with a move towards smaller production runs of particular styles. This movement spread to other parts of the world as well.


=== Techniques used in modern studios ===
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating their pieces. The ancient technique of blown glass, where a glassblower works at a furnace full of molten glass using metal rods and hand tools to blow and shape almost any form of glass, is one of the more popular ways to work. Most large hollow pieces are made this way, and it allows the artist to be improvisational as they create their work.

Another type is flame-worked glass, which uses torches and kilns in its production. The artist generally works at a bench using rods and tubes of glass, shaping with hand tools to create their work. Many forms can be achieved this way with little investment into money and space. Though the artist is somewhat limited in the size of the work that can be created, a great level of detail can be achieved with this technique. The paperweights by Paul Stankard are good examples of what can be achieved with flame-working techniques. In the 21st century, flame-worked glass became commonly used as adornments on functional items. The glass conductor's baton, commissioned by Chandler Bridges for Dr. Andre Thomas, is a clear example of flame-working being used to transform a traditional item into an artistic statement.
Cast glass can be done at the furnace, at the torch or in a kiln. Generally the artist makes a mold out of refractory, sand, or plaster and silica which can be filled with either clear glass or colored or patterned glass, depending on the techniques and effects desired. Large scale sculpture is usually created this way.  Slumped glass and fused glass is similar to cast glass, but it is not done at as high of a temperature. Usually the glass is only heated enough to impress a shape or a texture onto the piece, or to stick several pieces of glass together without a glue.
The traditional technique of stained glass is still employed for the creation of studio glass. The artist cuts the glass into shapes and sets the pieces into lead cames which are soldered together.  They artist can also use hot techniques in a kiln to create texture, patterns, or change the overall shape of the glass.
Etched glass is created by dipping glass that has an acid resistant pattern applied to its surface into an acid solution. Also an artist can engrave it by hand using wheels. Sandblasting can create a similar effect.
Cold glass is any glass worked without the use of heat. Glass may be cut, chiseled, sandblasted, and glued or bonded to form art objects ranging from small pieces to monumental sculpture.
(more details below)


== The studio glass movement ==
The international studio glass movement originated in America, spreading to Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia. The emphasis of this movement was on the artist as the designer and maker of one-of-a-kind objects, in a small studio environment.  This movement enabled the sharing of technical knowledge and ideas among artists and designers that, in industry, would not be possible.
With the dominance of Modernism in the arts, there was a broadening of artistic media throughout the 20th century. Indeed, glass was part of the curriculum at art schools such as the Bauhaus. Frank Lloyd Wright produced glass windows considered by some as masterpieces not only of design, but of painterly composition as well.  During the 1950s, studio ceramics and other craft media in the U.S. began to gain in popularity and importance, and American artists interested in glass looked for new paths outside industry. Harvey Littleton, often referred to as the ""Father of the Studio Glass Movement"", was inspired to develop studio glassblowing in America by the great glass being designed and made in Italy, Sweden and many other places, and by the pioneering work in ceramics of the California potter Peter Voulkos. Harvey Littleton and Dominick Labino held the now-famous glass workshop at the Toledo Museum of Art in 1962.  The goal was to melt glass in a small furnace so individual artists could use glass as an art medium in a non-industrial setting.  This was the workshop that would stimulate the studio glass movement that spread around the world.  Instead of the large, industrial settings of the past, a glass artist could now work with a small glass furnace in an individual setting and produce art from glass.


== Modern regional glass art ==


=== Australia ===
The early glass movement (studio glass) in Australia was spurred on by a visit to Australia by American artist Bill Boysen, who toured the country in the early seventies with a mobile studio. Boysen traveled to Australia in 1974, where he promoted glass artistry by presenting a ""revolutionary demonstration of glass blowing"" to a gathering of around 250 attendees. Boysen's mobile studio ""successfully toured eight eastern states’ venues in ’74, thus greatly enhancing the credibility of hand crafted glass."" Boysen's visit is credited with helping ""inspire a generation of [Australian] artists to work with glass and eventually led to the creation of the national glass art collection"" in Wagga Wagga, Australia. This important collection includes over 450 works of art and is ""the most comprehensive public collection of Australian studio glass anywhere."" Since that time Australian glass has gained worldwide recognition with Adelaide in South Australia, hosting the International Glass Art Society Conference in 2005 on only its third occasion outside of the U.S. The Ranamok Glass Prize, presented every year from 1994 to 2014, promotes contemporary glass artists living in Australia and New Zealand.


=== Belgium ===
Daniël Theys en Chris Miseur from the glass factory Theys & Miseur in Kortrijk-Dutsel, Belgium, which represent Belgian artistic glass work concerning the entire world. In 2015, John Moran (winner of Blown Away Season 3) co-founded Gent Glas, a public glass studio focused on introducing glass as an artistic medium to the general public. The studio has gone on to invite over 40 visiting artists from 13 different countries.


=== China ===
Although China has a very long tradion of glass art, studio glass was arguably first made by Loretta H. Yang and Chang Yi in 1987 at the first contemporary Chinese liuli art studio Liuligongfang.  In 1997, Yang and Chang released their technique and procedure to the public.  The Liuligongfang technique has since become a key cornerstone upon which contemporary Chinese liuli is built with Yang and Chang widely recognized as the pioneers and founders of contemporary Chinese liuli.


=== Italy ===

Glass blowing began in the Roman Empire, and Italy has refined the techniques of glass blowing ever since. Until the very recent explosion of glass shops in Seattle (US), there were more on the Island of Murano (Italy) than anywhere else in world. The majority of the refined artistic techniques of glassblowing (e.g., incalmo, reticello, zanfirico, latticino) were developed there. Moreover, generations of blowers passed on their techniques to family members. Boys would begin working at the fornace (actually ""furnace""—called ""the factory"" in English).


=== Japan ===
Japanese glass art which was inspired by the studio glass movement of the 1960s has a short history. The first independent glass studios of this period were built by Saburo Funakoshi and Makoto Ito, and Shinzo Kotani in separate places. Yoshihiko Takahashi and Hiroshi Yamano show their works at galleries throughout the world and are arguably Japan's glass artists of note. Yoichi Ohira has worked with great success in Murano with Italian gaffers. The small Pacific island Niijima, administered by Tokyo, has a renowned glass art center, built and run by Osamu and Yumiko Noda, graduates of Illinois State University, where they studied with Joel Philip Myers. Every autumn, the Niijima International Glass Art Festival takes place inviting top international glass artists for demonstrations and seminars. Emerging glass artists, such as Yukako Kojima and Tomoe Shizumu, were featured at the 2007 Glass Art Society exhibition space at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Toshichi Iwata and Kyohei Fujita were noteworthy Japanese studio glass artists who worked before and after the studio glass movement of the 1960s. Both were active studio glass artists by the late 1940s. Fujita got his start working in the production part of Toshichi Iwata's studio which was founded in 1947.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico was the first country in Latin America to have a glass factory in the early sixteenth century brought by the Spanish conquerors. Although traditional glass in Mexico has prevailed over modern glass art, since the 1970s there have been a List of glass artists#Mexico  that have given a place to that country in international glass art.


=== The Netherlands ===
Glass art in the Netherlands is mainly stimulated by the glass designing and glass blowing factory Royal Leerdam Crystal. Such notable designers as H.P. Berlage, Andries Copier and Sybren Valkema, Willem Heesen (Master Glassblower as well) had a major influence on Dutch glass art. Later the studio glass movement, inspired by the American Harvey Littleton and the new Workgroup Glass founded by Sybren Valkema at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam led to a new generation of glass artists.


=== United Kingdom ===

Notable centres of glass production in the UK have been St. Helens in Merseyside (the home of Pilkington Glass and the site on which lead crystal glass was first produced by George Ravenscroft), Stourbridge in the Midlands and Sunderland in the North East. Sunderland is now home to the National Glass Centre which houses a specialist glass art course. St. Helens boasts a similar establishment but without the educational body attached. Perthshire in Scotland was known internationally for its glass paperweights. It has always hosted the best glass artists working on small scales, but closed its factory in Crieff, Scotland in January 2002.
Glass artists in the UK have a variety of exhibitions. The Scottish Glass Society hosts a yearly exhibition for members, the Guild of Glass Engravers exhibit every two years and the British Glass Biennale, begun in 2004 is now opening its third show.
British Glass Art owes much to the long history of craft. The majority of its glass blowers who operate small studio furnaces produce aesthetically beautiful though primarily functional objects. Technical skill as a blower is given as much importance as the artistic intent.
The Glasshouse, one of the first artist run UK studios, was established in 1967. Artists such as Jane Bruce, Steven Newell, Catherine Hough, Annette Meech, Christopher Williams and Simon Moore spent time working there until it closed its doors in the late 1990's.
There are now a growing number of glass studios in the UK. Many specialize in production glassware while others concentrate on one off or limited edition pieces. An Arts Council funded, non-profit making organisation, the Contemporary Glass Society, founded in 1976 as British Artists in Glass, exists to promote and support the work of glass artists in the UK.
Other glass organisations in the UK are The Guild of Glass Engravers, the Scottish Glass Society and Cohesion. Cohesion is a different sort of entity to the other organisations in that it was specifically founded to promote and develop glass art as a commercial concern. It organises trade events in and around the UK and at the international level. Originally it focused only on artists based the north east of England but has since expanded its remit to cover the whole of the UK.
An internationally renown center for glass, NorthLands Creative Glass, was established in late 1990s in the far north of Scotland by Dan Klein, Ian & Bunty Gunn and Robert McClennan as a center of excellence for the exploration of glass. It offered residencies and masterclasses to arts students and established artists both within and outside of the glass field. Sadly, after 27 years, in 2023, NorthLands Creative Glass permanently closed its doors.
In November 2007 the glass sculpture Model for a Hotel was unveiled as an exhibit on the fourth plinth of Trafalgar Square, London.


=== United States ===
The United States has had two phases of development in glass.  The first, in the early and mid-1900s, started in the cities of Toledo, Ohio, and Corning, New York, where factories such as Fenton and Steuben were making both functional and artistic glass pieces. Toledo's rich history in glass goes back to the turn of the century when Libbey Glass, Owens-Illinois and Johns Manville led the world in the manufacturing of glass products. Their reputations earned Toledo the title of the ""Glass Capital of the World."" These industry leaders, along with the Toledo Museum of Art, sponsored the first glass workshop in 1961.  This workshop would lead to a new movement in American studio glass.


==== The American Studio Glass Movement ====
The second, and most prominent, phase in American glass began in 1962, when then-ceramics professor Harvey Littleton and chemist Dominick Labino began the contemporary glassblowing movement.  The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art.  Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. Harvey Littleton extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching and training, including many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including Marvin Lipofsky, Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and Dale Chihuly.
In 1964, Tom McGlauchlin started one of the first accredited glass programs at the University of Iowa, and Marvin Lipofsky founded the university-level glass program at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1964, Dr. Robert C. Fritz founded a university-level glass program at San Jose State University in San Jose, California.  As a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under Harvey Littleton, Bill H. Boysen built the first glass studio at Penland School of Crafts, in Penland, North Carolina, in 1965.  After graduating in 1966, he started the graduate glass program at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Illinois. Dale Chihuly initiated the glass program at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1969. Tom McGlauchlin joined the Toledo Museum of Art as Professor and Director of Glass in conjunction with the University of Toledo's Art program in 1971.


==== American Glass Schools and Studios ====

The growth of studio glass led to the formation of glass schools and art studios located across the country.  The largest concentrations of glass artists are located in Seattle, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County and Corning, New York also have sizable concentrations of artists working in glass.
The Pilchuck Glass School near Seattle has become a mecca for glass artists from all over the world. Those who attend Pilchuck, either college students or established artists, have the opportunity to attend master classes and exchange skills and information in an environment dedicated solely to glass based arts.
Pittsburgh Glass Center in Pittsburgh has residency programs for artists working in glass, as well as a facility for artists to make use of for their works. Pittsburgh Glass Center offers classes to the public on glassblowing and many other forms of glass art. Philadelphia hosts a small array of glass studios for artists that use glass. Home to the National Liberty Museum (featuring all exhibits by international glass artists), Philadelphia hosts the non-profit P.I.P.E. program, with residencies for artists that use glass as well as metal, electroforming on glass, and bronze casting. The state of Pennsylvania has a long tradition of the production of industrial glass and its influence has quickly been absorbed by artists working in glass.
The Studio of The Corning Museum of Glass, established in 1996, is an internationally renowned teaching facility in Corning, NY.  Classes and workshops are held for new and experienced glassworkers and artists.  The Studio's residency program brings artists from around the world to Corning for a month to work in The Studio facilities, where they can explore and develop new glassblowing techniques or expand on their current bodies of work; recipients of the Specialty Glass Residency include Beth Lipman, Mark Peiser, Karen LaMonte, and Anna Mlasowsky. Artists working in The Studio have access to the collections of The Corning Museum of Glass, and benefit from the resources of the Rakow Research Library, whose holdings cover the art and history of glass and glassmaking.
Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center, located in the historic glass industry capital of Millville, New Jersey, is a nonprofit art and history education center that is home to the Museum of American Glass, which houses the largest collection of American glass objects in the world. The collection includes historical glass as well as contemporary work from some of the glass world's biggest names. In addition to the museum, WheatonArts operates a world-class glass studio under the creative direction of Hank Murta Adams. The Creative Glass Center of America, which is funded by WheatonArts and crucial to its mission of continuing Millville's legacy in the glass world, hosts a fellowship program exclusively for up-and-coming and mid-career artists working in glass. Well-known alumnae of the CGCA fellowship include Steve Tobin (1983) Kait Rhoads (1997 and 2008), Lino Tagliapietra (1989), Beth Lipman  (2001), Gregory Nangle (2006), Deborah Czeresko (2006 and 2010), Angus Powers (2003), and Stephen Paul Day (1992, 1997, 2004, and 2009).
San Jose State University glass program was started by Dr. Robert Fritz in 1964 and is the oldest educational studio glass program in California.  Dr. Fritz died suddenly in 1986 and Mary B. White ran the program from 1986 to 2005.


== Techniques and processes ==


=== Stained glass ===

Stained glass, such as the windows that are seen in churches, are windows that contain an element of painting in them. The window is designed. After the glass has been cut to shape, paint that contains ground glass is applied, so that, when it is fired in a kiln, the paint fuses onto the glass surface. Following this process, the sections of glass are placed together and held in place with lead came that is then soldered at the joints.
Leadlights and stained glass are manufactured in the same way, but leadlights do not contain any sections of glass that have been painted.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Blown glass ===
Glassblowing is one of the most used technique for creating ""art glass"" and is still favoured by most of today's studio glass artists. This is because of the artist's intimacy with the material, and an almost infinite opportunity for creativity and variation at almost every stage of the process.  Glassblowing can be used to create a multitude of shapes and can incorporate color through a wide range of techniques.  Coloured glass can be gathered out of a crucible, clear glass can be rolled in powdered colored glass to coat the outside of a bubble, it can be rolled in chips of glass, it can be stretched into rods and incorporated through caneworking, or it can be layered, cut and fused into tiles, and incorporated into a bubble of glass for intricate patterns through murrine.  ""Blown glass"" refers only to individually hand-made items but can include the use of moulds for shaping, ribbing, and spiking to produce decorative bubbles. Glass blown articles must be made of compatible glass or the stress in the piece will cause a failure.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Lampworking ===
Similar to glassblowing, Lampworking (also called flameworking or torchworking) is a style in which the artist manipulates glass with the use of a torch – rather than a blowpipe or blow tube – on a smaller scale. Once in a molten state, the glass is formed by blowing and shaping with tools and hand movements. Though typical lampworking art takes the form of beads, figurines, marbles, small vessels, Christmas tree ornaments, and other such things, it is also used to create scientific instruments as well as glass models of animals and botanical subjects.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Kiln-formed glass ===

Kiln formed glass is usually referred to as warm glass, and can be either made up from a single piece of glass that is slumped into or over a mould or different colours and sheets of glass fused together. The process of hot glass is highly scientific in that the types of glass and temperatures that they must be fired at is quite complicated operation to undertake correctly. Art glass that is kiln formed usually take the form of dishes, plates or tiles. Glass that is fused in a kiln must be of the same co-efficient of expansion (CoE). If glass that does not have the same CoE is used for fusing, the differing rates of contraction will cause minute stress fractures to form and, over time, these fractures will cause a piece to crack. The use of polarizing filters to inspect the work will determine if stress fractures are present.


=== Cold glass ===
Cold glass is worked by any method that does not use heat. Processes include sandblasting, cutting, sawing, chiseling, bonding and gluing.


==== Sandblasting ====
Glass can be decorated by sandblasting the surface of a piece in order to remove a layer of glass, thereby making a design stand out. Items that are sandblasted are usually thick slabs of glass into which a design has been carved by means of high pressure sandblasting. This technique provides a three-dimensional effect but is not suitable for toughened glass as the process could shatter it.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Copperfoil technique ===
The technique of using copperfoil is mainly used in the construction of smaller pieces such as Tiffany style lamps, and it was, in fact, frequently used by Louis Comfort Tiffany.  It consists of wrapping cut sections of glass in a self-adhesive tape that is made out of thin copper foil. This technique requires a great deal of dexterity and is also very time-consuming. After the sections have been foiled, they are soldered together in order to form the item.

Gravitational memory effect,"Gravitational memory effects, also known as gravitational-wave memory effects are predicted persistent changes in the relative position of pairs of masses in space due to the passing of a gravitational wave. Detection of gravitational memory effects has been suggested as a way of validating general relativity.
In 2014 Andrew Strominger and Alexander Zhiboedov showed that the formula related to the memory effect is the Fourier transform in time of Weinberg's soft graviton theorem.


== Linear and non linear effect ==
There are two kinds of predicted gravitational memory effect: one based on a linear approximation of Einstein's equations, first proposed in 1974 by the Soviet scientists Yakov Zel'dovich and A. G. Polnarev, developed also by Vladimir Braginsky and L. P. Grishchuk, and a non-linear phenomenon known as the non-linear memory effect, which was first proposed in the 1990s by Demetrios Christodoulou.
The non-linear memory effect could be exploited to determine the inclination, with respect to us observers, of the plane on which the two objects that merged and generated the gravitational waves were moving, making the calculation of their distance more precise, since the amplitude of the received wave (what is experimentally measured) depends on the distance of the source and the aforementioned inclination with respect to us.


== Gravitational spin memory ==
In 2016, a new type of memory effect, induced by gravitational waves incident on rays of light moving along circular trajectories perpendicular to the waves, was proposed by Sabrina Gonzalez Pasterski, Strominger and Zhiboedov. This is caused by the angular momentum of the waves themselves and therefore termed gravitational spin memory. As in the previous case, this memory also turns out to be a Fourier transform in time, but, in this case, of the graviton theorem expanded to the subleading term.


== Detection ==
The effect should, in theory, be detectable by recording changes in the distance between pairs of free-falling objects in spacetime before and after the passage of gravitational waves. The proposed LISA detector is expected to detect the memory effect easily. In contrast, detection with the existing LIGO is complicated by two factors. First, LIGO detection targets a higher frequency range than is desirable for detection of memory effects. Secondly, LIGO is not in free-fall, and its parts will drift back to their equilibrium position following the passage of the gravitational waves. However, as thousands of events from LIGO and similar earth-based detectors are recorded and statistically analyzed over the course of several years, the cumulative data may be sufficient to confirm the existence of the gravitational memory effect.

Conservation and restoration of wooden artifacts,"The conservation and restoration of wooden artifacts refers to the preservation of art and artifacts made of wood. Conservation and restoration in regards to cultural heritage is completed by a conservator-restorer. 

See also Conservation and restoration of wooden furniture


== Nature of the material ==
Wood is a vascular material that comes from the trunk, roots, or stems of over 3,000 varieties of plants. It is a cellular tissue and therefore can be understood by looking into the biological structure.


=== Cell structure ===
Wood is porous and its growth is directional. This is due to the cellular structure of the material. Cellular structure determines factors such as grain, texture, and color. Identification of wood types is undertaken by a conservation scientist.


==== Grain ====
Wood grain is created by the variations in number and arrangement of cells. It specifically refers to the longitudinal alignment of cells, or the direction in which the fibers are going. The six types of grain are: straight, irregular, diagonal, spiral, interlocked, and wavy. The directional of the grain directly corresponds with the strength of the wood.


==== Texture ====
Texture is dependent on the dimensions of the vessels that make up the wood. Large vessels result in coarse wood, while small vessels result in a fine texture.


==== Color ====
Color is determined by the infiltrates in the cell walls of the wood. Infiltrates can be affected by light, air, and heat which cause chemical reactions within the cell wall. These chemical reactions are what give the wood its color or what led to a change in the wood's color.


== Structure of wooden artifacts ==


=== Joinery ===
Joinery refers to any way that two separate components are put together. Joinery in regards to wood can take the form of any of the following:

Widening joints
Angle joints
Framing joints – join two pieces of wood at a right angle
Dovetailing
Mortise and tenon
Edge Joints – join two pieces of wood along the long edges of the board
Glue
Tongue and Groove
Spline Joints-Lengthen wooden boards
Mitre and dowel joint
Hardware
See Woodworking joints
The success of joinery depends on the join chosen, the grain direction of joined parts, the amount of stresses imposed, wood movement in regards to moisture, and the surface quality of joins. If any one of these factors is compromised then the join is not as strong as it could be.


=== Surfaces ===
Wooden objects are often coated a surface protection or ornamentation. The following are common examples of surface treatments for wooden artifacts:

Inlay
Paint
Varnish
Gilding
Lacquer


== Agents of deterioration ==


=== Humidity ===
Humidity influences the deterioration of wooden artifacts through due to too much moisture in the air, too little moisture in the air, or rapid fluctuations in moisture. Because of the composition of wood, careful control of humidity is a factor in preventive conservation. If the relative humidity is too low the wood will release some of its moisture into the air and dry out.  Conversely, if the relative humidity is too high, the wood absorbs water from the air and expands. Rapid fluctuations in humidity can lead to warping, loosening of joints, and splitting. High levels of moisture in the air also create an environment that encourages biological deterioration.


=== Weathering ===
Weathering related to the damage of objects caused by the exposure to wind, rain, sunshine, snow, or any other natural occurrence. These natural phenomenon erode away at the surface of the wood, causing damage to surfaces and structure.


=== Chemical agents ===
Chemical deterioration is caused by any agent that creates a chemical reaction within the cellular structure of the wood. The five common chemical agents that damage wood are:

Light – Creates a chemical reaction within the cell walls of wood, leading to a change in color or texture
Acids – Cause wood to become brittle.
Alkalies – Cause the fibers of the wood to separate and break down.
Salts – Similar to alkalies, salts break down the fibers of wood.
Fire – Wood is a flammable material that burns easily in most cases when exposed to fire.


=== Biological agents ===
Biological deterioration in regards to wooden artifacts is caused by mainly by Insects and Fungi eating away at the surface of the material, which can lead to further problems if left untreated.


==== Insects ====
Insects damage wooden artifacts by feeding on the organic material, leaving waste behind, or tunneling into the wood. Insect damage can be controlled by understanding their life cycle and needs. Because they rely on environment to regulate their body temperatures, insects will slow down activity the colder the temperature is and will not breed or develop if temperatures are under 50 degrees Fahrenheit, or 10 degrees Celsius. Aside from requiring high temperatures, insects also thrive on environments with high levels of relative humidity. Wooden artifacts can provide just the right environment for insects to feed, tunnel, breed, and reproduce, leading to a variety of damages to the wood, including, boring holes, waste material, chew marks, and exit holes.


==== Fungi ====
Fungi cause damage to wooden artifacts by eating away at the wood and causing it to rot. Growth occurs on wooden artifacts when the environment is damp due to high levels of humidity and poor ventilation.


==== Other pests ====
Birds – Mainly, woodpeckers, will cause damage to wooden objects left outdoors
 Marine Organisms – Can be problematic for artifacts that have recently been recovered from a maritime environment.
Rodents – Will gnaw at the surface of wooden objects to obtain food. This is mainly a problem for objects that were once storage vessels.


== Preventive conservation ==
Preventive conservation is a form of collections care that acts to prevent damage to artifacts. This type of conservation can be undertaken by any person who is trained as a collection manager, registrar, art handler, or conservator.


=== Environmental control ===
One of the most basic forms of preventive conservation is through environmental control, which includes the regulation of temperature, humidity, and light. Through environmental control, most forms of deterioration to wooden artifacts can be prevented relatively easily.


==== Temperature ====
Temperature affects wooden objects through its correlation with humidity. Generally lower temperatures increase the amount of moisture in the air, while higher temperatures decrease the amount of moisture in the air. As such, recommended temperature for storage and display of wooden artifacts is 70 °F (21 °C) during the winter months and 70–75 °F (21–24 °C) during the summer months.


==== Humidity ====
Recommended relative humidity for storage and display of wooden artifacts during the winter months is 35–45% and 55–65% during the summer months. Any percentage above 70 can lead to fungi or insect infestations. Careful control of relative humidity can reduce the risk of damage caused by loss or absorption of water. Equipment that can help in the regulation of humidity is air conditioning, a humidifier or dehumidifier depending on needs, or by implementing RH buffers.


==== Light ====
Light can cause cumulative damage to wooden artifacts, leading to discoloration of the surface. Long exposure to light can result in darkening of light woods and bleaching of dark woods. Infra red radiation and heat from light can also damage any finishes to the object, causing cracking of paint or varnish, brittleness, or softening of the surface.
To reduce the damage inflicted by light, it is recommended that the three following steps be taken:

Eliminate UV radiation – This can be done simply by keeping objects out of direct sunlight and displaying them behind UV filtering plexiglas.
Reduce the amount of time the object is exposed to light – Most cultural institutions limit the amount of time a light sensitive object is on display by rotating it in and out of the galleries. Light exposure can also be controlled by having motion activated lights with timers, so objects are only illuminated when visitors are present and then only for a short amount of time.
Keep light at minimal light levels comfortable for viewing-When an object is illuminated for viewers, it should be lit at the minimum level for comfortable viewing.


=== Cleaning ===
With wooden artifacts exposed to open air, it is important to remove particulates from the object's surface on a regular basis. The buildup of particulates can result in biological deterioration, encourage the growth of micro-organisms, and impair the qualities of an object's surface. Regular cleaning can reduce the long-term damage caused by the build-up of particulates. The most basic and effective method for regular cleaning of wooden artifacts is to dust off the surface with a dry cotton cloth. 


=== Storage ===
Wooden artifacts should be kept out of direct sunlight and in a space where they will not get bumped or jostled around.


=== Pest eradication ===
Treatment for ridding wooden artifacts of insects usually involves a combination of the following techniques:

Insecticidal treatment – Insecticides can be placed directly on areas of an object, or be used to treat large areas within the space where the objects are housed
Temperature-based treatment – Since insects need specific temperatures to thrive, placing objects in a freezer that is -25 to -30 degrees Celsius for three days will kill off any remaining insects. Alternatively, placing objects in a space that is heated to 50 degrees Celius for an hour will also kill all stages of insect growth.
Low oxygen atmostpheres-Keeping wooden artifacts in an air-tight space filled with nitrogen or argon for a 21-day period will end the insect life cycle and can be used as an alternative to pesticides.


== Object treatment ==


=== Surface cleaning ===
Surface cleaning refers to the removal of particulates from the surface of an object. To clean the surface of wooden artifacts, conservators generally use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush. If wet surface cleaning is necessary, a dilute detergent can be applied with the use of a cotton swab or soft cotton cloth.


=== Drying ===
If a wooden artifact has sustained water damage, then the object must be dried slowly so as not to cause splitting of the wood as it dries. Similar to relative humidity, a rapid fluctuation in moisture from water damage can cause further damage to wooden objects. Slow controlled drying can be achieved by lower the relative humidity and creating a tent for the artifact so that it does not lose moisture too quickly.


=== Consolidation ===
If a wooden object has been damaged by insects or fungi, one treatment method is to consolidate the damaged fibers using a liquid resin or solvent to strengthen the material. This method can lead to visual changes in the object and is not always reversible.
Consolidation can also refer to the treatment of painted wood surfaces. Because of the complicated nature of wood as a material, consolidation of paint on a wooden artifact must be carefully undertaken. As wood expands and contracts with fluctuations in temperature and humidity, damages can occur to paint on the wood's surface.


=== Structural repair ===
Structural repair to wooden artifacts, as with the conservation of any artifact, should be as unobtrusive as possible. One method for mending separated pieces of wooden artifacts is the use of hot or liquid hide glue. To reverse warping of wooden artifacts, conservators often treat artifacts using pressure. Treatment methods can be broken down into three categories: Direct Woodworking, Indirect Woodworking, and Moisture-Related Methods.

Integrity Engineering encompasses the concept of:

Organize, review, analyze, improve and control cycle  
Consistency of actions, values, methods, measures, principles, expectations, and outcomes
An undivided or unbroken completeness or totality with nothing wanting
Knowledge of many interfaces of technology
Balancing and countering the materials degradation process during the in-service life cycle of equipment
Ensuring the recommended risk mitigation actions derived from the RBI study are implemented
Ensuring inspection intervals are not exceeded
Ensuring resources are available for RBI Assessments
This may be applied to management, machines, devices, systems, materials, and processes that safely realize improvements to the lives of assets.
The Integrity Engineer (IE) may also be involved with other asset life-cycle issues, such as the basis of design (Process design basis) through to recycling. The Front End Engineering Design stage (FEED) aids in the selection of vessels, piping, pipelines, and other equipment. At this FEED stage, the optimum material requirements, mitigation, and maintenance requirements for the intended period of operation become the basis for detailed engineering. It is the role of the IE to develop/validate the integrity management plan and implement the monitoring and management procedure for the intended period of operation. It may also be the responsibility of the integrity engineer to incorporate and manage any variation identified (metal loss, material degradation, cracking mechanisms, mitigation issues, i.e. Cathodic protection potentials, coating failures, etc.) during the monitoring regime.
It may be a generalist in nature and/or applied with specific prior knowledge denoted using a pre-nominal of Mechanical, Inspection, Asset, Well or Wellhead, Technical, Pipeline, Signal, Fabrication, or Commissioning depending upon the equipment or system under scrutiny.
Integrity Engineers construct and implement Integrity Management plans that detail the requirements of the item or asset under scrutiny and study any adverse effects from internal or external sources that damage / impair that item or system. These are used to build suitable inspection and condition monitoring forward strategies. The monitoring may include physical (pipes/vessels) and nonphysical systems (Management legal obligations). This diversity will depend upon the requirements of the task at hand.
Integrity Engineers also oversee or carry out Integrity Engineering Audit(s) to ensure legal compliance with company, national and international standards and ensure quality assurance within the process that meets good engineering standards.

Reanimated collaboration,"A reanimated collaboration (often shortened to reanimated collab or reanimate) is a type of collaborative fan-made animation project wherein each animator recreates one shot of an existing film in their own style. The individual works are then stitched into the original order and published on the internet as a completed collaboration, creating a collaborative tribute to the original film. This differs from a shot-for-shot recreation, as the goal of a reanimate is to display each of the independent animators' unique stylings rather than to produce a unified or identical result. Multiple collaborations focus on media made a decade or more prior that receives renewed interest due to internet memes, nostalgia, or the death of a voice actor. As they are often non-profit tributes to an existing work, animators expect to receive little or no profit.


== Notable examples ==
Moon Animate Make-Up! (2014) — Over 250 animators collaborated to reanimate the 38th episode of the DiC English dub of Sailor Moon, ""Fractious Friends"" (1995). This project is considered to be the first major reanimated internet-collaboration, and eventually led to this style of video increasing in popularity during the late 2010s. As of 2022, the collaboration has over 2.75 million views. A sequel, Moon Animate Make-Up! 2 (2016) reanimated the original Japanese version of the 68th episode, ""Protect Chibiusa! Clash of the 10 Warriors"" (1993).
Mama Luigi Project (2017) — 227 animators reanimated the 11-minute Super Mario World episode ""Mama Luigi"" (1991). Each of the 255 total scenes featured a different animation style. It was dedicated to the memories of Canadian actor Tony Rosato, who voiced Luigi, and Canadian actor Harvey Atkin, who voiced King Koopa. This project ultimately generated a resurgence of popularity in reanimated collaborations. The video has 6 million views as of 2022.
Steamed Hams but There's a Different Animator Every 13 Seconds (2018) — Andrew Kepple of Albino Blacksheep hosted the project, which reanimated ""Steamed Hams,"" a memorable sequence from the 1996 The Simpsons episode ""22 Short Films about Springfield,"" that had a surge in popularity in the mid-2010s due to internet memes. As of 2024, the video has over 12 million views.
Shrek Retold (2018) — A reanimated collab fan film in which over 200 animators, songwriters, and voice actors recreated Shrek (2001). 3GI is best known for organizing the Shrek-themed festival ""Shrekfest"" in Milwaukee, WI, held annually from 2014 to 2024. The reanimated collab contains mediums including 2D animation, 3D animation, live action, and stop-motion. Collaborators included David Liebe Hart, Michael Cusack, Ratboy Genius, Anthony Fantano, and SiIvaGunner.
Kirby Reanimated Collab (2019) — Featuring over 300 artists, the project recreated the English dub of Kirby Right Back at Ya! episode 49, ""Cartoon Buffoon"". The project was directed by Roya Shahidi, and it has received over 3 million views as of 2022. The project was taken down due to DMCA copyright claims multiple times, despite Nintendo claiming it was not behind the takedowns. The video is dedicated to animator Michael ""Mikey"" McBride (credited as AngelXMikey), who passed away from cystic fibrosis the day it was released.
The Zelda CDi Reanimated Collab! (2020) — PatchToons hosted and released a 21-minute collaboration that recreated the cutscenes of The Legend of Zelda CDi games (1993), which were popularized in the mid-2000s and 2010s with YouTube poop parodies. Over 200 animators collaborated on the project. Nintendo Wire reported, ""The ever-shifting mediums and the contrasting animation styles, ranging from professional and sophisticated to intentionally goofy and exaggerated, lend themselves incredibly well to cutscenes that were already chaotic and bizarre to begin with."" It was also uploaded to animation website Newgrounds.
Team Fabulous 2 Reanimated (2020) - A collaboration fan short film featuring the work of over 100 animators remaking the late Kitty0706's short film Team Fabulous 2, based on the Valve MMOFPS Team Fortress 2. Most of the scenes were reanimated in 2D, and scenes that were already 2D in the original video were reanimated in 3D with Source Filmmaker 2. The short film was released by TFConnect on 6th July 2020, and as of January 2024, it has amassed 4.8 million views. The short also paid tribute to the late voice actor Rick May, who voiced the Soldier in the game and died from COVID in April 2020. The team also hosted reanimation collabs for the promotional short Meet the Soldier, featuring 2D, 3D, and live-action scenes (the latter of which was unfinished). 
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie: Rehydrated! (2022) — A collaboration fan film between over 300 artists that recreated The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004) as a tribute to late SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died of ALS in 2018. Similarly to Shrek Retold, the audio was re-dubbed and re-instrumented specifically to bypass YouTube's copyright restrictions. Despite this, the video was taken down due to a copyright claim from Paramount within an hour of the video's premiere. This takedown outraged fans and participants of the project, leading to the Twitter hashtag, #JusticeForSpongebob. The video has since been restored to YouTube and has over 2 million views as of 2022.
Shrek 2 Retold (2024) — A collaboration fan film that was originally announced in an April Fools' Day video titled Shrek 2 Retold, in which the project director discussed the creation of Shrek Retold. Trailers for the project were released during Shrekfest 2019 and on the twentieth anniversary of the original film. The movie premiered at the tenth Shrekfest via an in-person screening at the Oriental Theatre MKE on September 3, 2023. It was then followed up by a panel discussion featuring Quinton Reviews, who contributed to the second remake. The film was announced to be released on YouTube on September 28, 2024. On September 20, 2024, it was announced that the film was delayed indefinitely, and would be released when finished.

Fire challenge,"The fire challenge is an internet challenge which involves applying flammable liquids to one's body and then setting the liquids aflame, while being video recorded; the footage is then posted to social media sites. Firefighters, police officers and media sources have criticized and spoken out against the activity, hoping to dissuade individuals from trying it due to its harmful nature. 
The first known fire challenge video was uploaded in 2012. The activity gained mainstream media attention in 2014.


== Effect ==
Immediate first through second degree burns are the direct results of undergoing the activity. One teenager from Kentucky who participated in the challenge described the subsequent pain as ""unbearable.""
In addition to the obvious dangers, many participants run away in panic without dousing the flames first, allowing the oxygen to cause the flames to spread more easily. Another immediate danger is the participants inhaling superheated air, which can then damage the lungs.


== Reactions ==
Writing for The Huffington Post, in response to viewing a video of a youth attempting the challenge, Andres Jauregui stated on the behalf of his coworkers:  
""We're basically speechless. We hang out with guys who eat lightbulbs, and we're still shocked. Granted, those guys are trained professional performers, where as [sic] this appears to be a misguided youth. The scariest part is that he's not the only person who is doing this.""

Writing for the Washington Post, Caitlin Dewey noted ""YouTube has known its fair share of dangerous, destructive and ill-advised trends, but even by those standards, the 'fire challenge' hits new lows.""
Multiple local and state fire departments have spoken out against the fire challenge, often citing the significant harm and the unpredictability of fire for their reasoning.

Bail,"Bail is money given to the court to guarantee that someone will go to their trial. If the person does not show up for their trial, the government gets to keep the money.
If the arrested person cannot afford the full bail amount, they can use a bail bond. This is a system where part of the bail amount is paid to a company, and they do the bail paperwork. Unlike placing the full bail to the court, the bail bond payment is not returned.
If someone uses a bail bond company, and they do not show up for their court appearance (these people are known as ""bail jumpers"") a bounty hunter can be hired to track them down and bring them back.",0

Fire sale,"A fire sale is the sale of goods at extremely discounted prices. The term originated in reference to the sale of goods at a heavy discount due to fire damage. It may or may not be defined as a closeout, the final sale of goods to zero inventory. They are said to occur in the financial markets when bidders who value assets highly are prevented from bidding on them, depressing the average selling price below what it otherwise would be. This lowering of the price can cause even further issues because it may be inaccurately perceived as signalling negative information.


== History ==
The term is adapted from reference to the sale of fire-damaged goods at reduced prices.  In Proceedings of the Fitchburg [Mass.] Historical Society and Papers Relating to the History of the Town Read by Some of the Members the following entry is found:

In December, 1856, the account of an extensive fire in the American House mentions the following occupants: E. B. Gee, clothing; T. B. Choate, drugs; J. C. Tenney, boots and shoes; Maraton Upton, dry goods; and M. W. Hayward, groceries. Maraton Upton removed his stock to No. 9 Rollstone block, and advertised ""Extraordinary fire sale; customers are invited to call and examine goods which are still warm.""
The term also has a counterpart in ""railroad salvage"", the discount sale of goods damaged in derailment or other accidents.
According to Plutarch, Crassus would show up to a burning building with a fire brigade and offer to put out the fire, or sometimes to buy the property at an outrageous discount.  If the owner agreed, he would put out the fire.  If they refused, he would stand by and let it burn.


== Sports ==
In professional sports, a fire sale occurs when a team trades many of its veteran players, especially expensive star players, to other teams for less expensive and usually younger players.  Teams usually have a fire sale for financial reasons. The term is generally thought of as different from merely ""rebuilding"" a team, because during a rebuilding process, teams often obtain players who are already in the major leagues or who are close to being major-league-ready, while retaining at least some of their key veterans (such as a franchise player) while also getting players from their minor league system; most rebuilding teams have few veterans remaining to jettison in the first place. On the other hand, trades in a fire sale often bring a team draft picks and prospects who have little to no major-league experience in their sport, in exchange for proven, experienced veterans. The term comes from the perception that the team is trying to get rid of all its players.


=== Baseball ===
In sports, the term fire sale is especially used in Major League Baseball, where the most infamous fire sale occurred in 1997. Weeks after winning the 1997 World Series, the Florida Marlins began trading away several of their high salary players and key cogs in the championship run, with Moisés Alou and Al Leiter among the first of many to go throughout the off-season and well into the 1998 season. This ended any realistic chance of the Marlins' defending their title. They plummeted to a 54–108 record in 1998, the worst ever by a defending World Series champion.
Owner and manager Connie Mack put the Philadelphia Athletics through a fire sale twice.  In 1914, the Athletics lost the 1914 World Series to the ""Miracle Braves"" in a four-game sweep. Mack traded, sold or released most of the team's star players soon after, in what could be considered as the first fire sale in organized sports.
The second and more consequential fire sale came after the 1933 season. On December 12, Mack traded Mickey Cochrane to the Detroit Tigers for Johnny Pasek and $100,000 and then traded Pasek and former 20-game winner George Earnshaw to the Chicago White Sox for Charlie Berry and $20,000. On the same day he traded another future Hall of Famer, sending Lefty Grove, Max Bishop and Rube Walberg to the Boston Red Sox for Rabbit Warstler, Bob Kline and $125,000. Between 1933 and 1935 the Athletics also traded or sold Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, Doc Cramer, and Jimmie Dykes. The Athletics would never come close to having the success they had before the fire sale and the team eventually moved to Kansas City in 1955.
The Athletics went through another major fire sale in anticipation of a move to Las Vegas. In April 2023, the Athletics ceased negotiations with the city of Oakland, California, where the team had played since 1968, in favor of constructing a stadium on a plot of land near Interstate 15. This was eventually changed to the plot of land where the Tropicana hotel and casino sits due to problems with the land that was originally chosen. The fire sale was seen by many as a way to provide a reason for this move. In response, Athletics fans hung several banners deriding team ownership and calling for the team to remain in Oakland at the Coliseum, which were controversially cropped out on the MLB.tv broadcast. The fire sale had taken place since the beginning of the 2022 season, when the Athletics suffered their worst season since 1979, losing 102 games. Despite fan protests, during the 2023 All-Star Game, Rob Manfred confirmed that relocation papers had been filed and that relocation proceedings had begun following the approval of a Nevada legislative package providing funding for the move.
Another infamous fire sale occurred in 1994.  The Montreal Expos ended the strike-shortened 1994 season with the best record in the majors. But by the start of the following season, many of the team's young stars had either been traded or lost to free agency. The Expos never really recovered on or off the field from this, and moved to Washington, D.C., as the Nationals in 2005.
The Miami Marlins had another controversial fire sale in the 2012–2013 offseason. In a massive, 12-player trade with the Toronto Blue Jays, they sent away such players as Josh Johnson, José Reyes, and Mark Buehrle.
In the 2017–18 offseason, the Marlins had yet another fire sale. After longtime owner Jeffrey Loria sold the team to a group led by former MLB player Derek Jeter and Bruce Sherman, nearly all of the team's star players, notably Giancarlo Stanton, Christian Yelich, and Marcell Ozuna, were traded to different teams across the major leagues. The motive for the team dismantling was primarily to help lessen payroll to pay off the organization's outstanding debt. The team's popularity notably declined in 2018 as a result of the fire sale, with the team's attendance falling to the lowest in Major League Baseball.
Another infamous fire sale took place immediately after the 2021-22 MLB lockout, when the Cincinnati Reds traded, refused to sign, or waived most of their star players, including Nick Castellanos, Jesse Winker, and Eugenio Suarez. This led to fan protests on social media and at Great American Ball Park, which in turn led to Phil Castellini telling fans ""Where are you gonna go?"" and ""Be careful what you ask for"" in an interview with WLW. The Reds went on to only win 3 of their first 25 games, and ended up with a record of 62–100, which was only the 2nd time the Reds lost at least 100 games in a season.


=== Other sports ===
The Ottawa Senators had a fire sale during the 2018–19 season. Several star players like Matt Duchene, Mike Hoffman, Mark Stone and team captain Erik Karlsson were traded in exchange for declining veterans, prospects and draft picks. Many perceived the fire sale as Senators' management being unwilling to sign stars to long-term, expensive extensions, as many of them would be eligible to become free agents after the season. The Senators would finish dead last in 2018–19, while their former stars found success on other teams, and fan attendance and support dropped significantly due to a lack of good will with Senators ownership and the fanbase.
In association football, clubs which go through financial troubles or are relegated and dropped into a lower division may need to go through a fire sale to reduce their operating expenses or replace the revenue lost from leaving the superior division. Players who are deemed to have overinflated wages or a lack of quality may be sold for low or no transfer fees in order to get their wage off the books.

Packaged terminal air conditioner,"A packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) is a kind of self-contained heating and air conditioning system. It is commonly found in hotels, motels, senior housing facilities, hospitals, condominiums, apartment buildings, add-on rooms & sunrooms. Many PTACs are designed to be installed in a wall. They have vents and heat sinks both inside and outside. Different standard dimensions are found in the market including 42×16 inches, 36x15 inches, and 40x15 inches.
The older units usually use mechanical control with mechanical push buttons to select the mode of operation and fan speed control. Another rotary knob is used to set the desired temperature of the unit. This was the most cost-effective and simplest method of control in the past. The development and the reduction in the cost of electronic controls have enabled manufacturers to implement electronic control touchpad that comes with remote control. Some of the electronic controls that have been built into the system including a timer control where you will be able to set when to ON or OFF the unit, Mode control is operated by pushing the same button to select the mode of operation. Temperature setting is displayed by the use of 7 segment display and buttons used to change the settings. Energy-saving features such as sleep or economizer functions where the set temperature will be automatically adjusted according to the duration that has elapsed.


== History ==
The first practical packaged terminal air conditioner was invented by engineers at Chrysler Motors.

Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion,"A boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE,  BLEV-ee) is an explosion caused by the rupture of a vessel containing a pressurized liquid that is or has reached a temperature sufficiently higher than its boiling point at atmospheric pressure. Because the boiling point of a liquid rises with pressure, the contents of the pressurized vessel can remain a liquid as long as the vessel is intact. If the vessel's integrity is compromised, the loss of pressure drops the boiling point, which can cause the liquid to convert to gas expanding rapidly. BLEVEs are manifestations of explosive boiling.
If the gas is flammable, as is the case with e.g., hydrocarbons and alcohols, further damage can be caused by the ensuing fire. However, BLEVEs do not necessarily involve fire.


== Name ==
On 24 April 1957, a process reactor at a Factory Mutual (FM) facility underwent a powerful explosion as a consequence of a rapid depressurization. It contained formalin mixed with phenol. The burst damaged the plant. However, no fire developed, as the mixture was not flammable. In the wake of the accident, researchers James B. Smith, William S. Marsh, and Wilbur L. Walls, who were employed with FM, came up with the terms ""boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion"" and its acronym ""BLEVE"". The expressions did not become of common use until the early 1970s, when the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Fire Command and Fire Journal magazines started publishing articles using them.


== Mechanism ==
There are three key elements in the formation of a BLEVE:

A material in liquid form at a temperature sufficiently above its normal atmospheric pressure boiling point.
A containment vessel maintaining the pressure that keeps the substance in liquid form.
A sudden loss of containment that rapidly drops the pressure.
Typically, a BLEVE starts with a vessel containing liquid held above its atmospheric-pressure boiling temperature. Many substances normally stored as liquids, such as carbon dioxide, propane, and other industrial gases have boiling temperatures below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure. In the case of water, a BLEVE could occur if a pressure vessel is heated beyond 100 °C (212 °F). That container, because the boiling water pressurizes it, must be capable of holding liquid water at very high temperatures.If the pressurized vessel ruptures, the pressure which prevents the liquid from boiling is lost. If the rupture is catastrophic, i.e., the vessel becomes suddenly no longer capable of holding any pressure, then the liquid will find itself at a temperature far above its boiling point. This causes a portion of the liquid to instantaneously vaporize with extremely rapid expansion. Depending on temperatures, pressures and the material involved, the expansion may be so rapid that it can be classified as an explosion, fully capable of inflicting severe damage on its surroundings.
For example, a tank of pressurized liquid water held at 350 °C (662 °F) might be pressurized to 10 MPa (1,500 psi) above atmospheric (or gauge) pressure. If the tank containing the water were to rupture, there would for a brief moment exist a volume of liquid water which would be at:

Atmospheric pressure
Temperature of 350 °C (662 °F).
At atmospheric pressure the boiling point of water is 100 °C (212 °F). Liquid water at atmospheric pressure does not exist at temperatures higher than 100 °C (212 °F). At that moment, the water would boil and turn to vapor explosively, and the 350 °C (662 °F) liquid water turned to gas would take up significantly more volume (≈ 1,600-fold) than it did as liquid, causing a vapor explosion. Such explosions can happen when the superheated water of a boiler escapes through a crack in a boiler, causing a boiler explosion.
The vaporization of liquid resulting in a BLEVE typically occurs within 1 millisecond after a catastrophic loss of containment.


=== Superheat limit theory ===

For a BLEVE to occur, the boiling liquid must be sufficiently superheated upon loss of containment. For example, at a pressure of approximately 1 MPa (150 psi), water boils at 177 °C (351 °F). Superheated water released from a closed container at these conditions will not generate a BLEVE, as homogeneous nucleation of vapor bubbles is not possible. There is no consensus about the minimal temperature above which a BLEVE will occur. A formula proposed by Robert Reid to predict it is:

  
    
      
        
          T
          
            min,BLEVE
          
        
        =
        0.895
         
        
          T
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{\text{min,BLEVE}}=0.895\ T_{\text{C}}}
  

where TC is the critical temperature of the fluid (expressed in kelvin). The minimum BLEVE temperatures of some fluids, based on this formula, are as follows:

According to Reid, BLEVE will occur, more in general, if the expansion crosses a ""superheat-limit locus"". In Reid's model, this curve is essentially the fluid's spinodal curve as represented in a pressure–temperature diagram, and the BLEVE onset is a manifestation of explosive boiling, where the spinodal is crossed ""from above"", i.e., via sudden depressurization. However, direct correspondence between the superheat limit and the spinodal has not been proven experimentally. In practical BLEVEs, the way the pressure vessel fails may influence decisively the way the expansion takes place, for example causing pressure waves and non-uniformities. Additionally, there may be stratification in the liquid, due to local temperature variations. Because of this, it is possible for BLEVEs to occur at temperatures less than those predicted with Reid's formula.


=== Physical BLEVEs ===
The term BLEVE is often associated to explosive fires from pressure vessels containing a flammable liquid. However, a BLEVE can occur even with a non-flammable substance such as water, liquid nitrogen, liquid helium or other refrigerants or cryogenics. Such materials can go through purely physical BLEVEs, not entailing flames or other chemical reactions. In the case of unignited BLEVEs of liquefied gases, rapid cooling due to the absorption of the enthalpy of vaporization is a hazard that can cause frostbite. Asphyxiation from the expanding vapors is also possible, if the vapor cloud is not rapidly dispersed, as can be the case inside a building, or in a trough in the case of heavier-than-air gasses. The vapors can also be toxic, in which case harm and possibly death can occur at relatively low concentrations and, therefore, even far from the source.


=== BLEVE–fireball ===
If a flammable substance, however, is subject to a BLEVE, it can ignite upon release, either due to friction, mechanical spark or other point sources, or from a pre-existing fire that had engulfed the pressure vessel and caused it to fail in the first place. In such a case, the burning vapors will further expand, adding to the force of the explosion. Furthermore, a very significant amount of the escaped fluid will burn in a matter of seconds in a raising fireball, which will generate extremely high levels of thermal radiation. While the blast effects can be devastating, a flammable substance BLEVE typically causes more damage due to the fireball thermal radiation than the blast overpressure.


== Effect of impinging fires ==
BLEVEs are often caused by an external fire near the storage vessel causing heating of the contents and pressure build-up. While tanks are often designed to withstand great pressure, constant heating can cause the metal to weaken and eventually fail. If the tank is being heated in an area where there is no liquid (such as near its top), it may rupture faster because the boiling liquid does not afford cooling in that area. Pressure vessels are usually equipped with relief valves that vent off excess pressure, but the tank can still fail if the pressure is not released quickly enough. A pressure vessel is designed to withstand the set pressure of its relief valves, but only if its mechanical integrity is not weakened as it can be in the case of an impinging fire. In an impinging fire scenario, flammable vapors released in the BLEVE will ignite upon release, forming a fireball. The origin of the impinging fire may be from a release of flammable fluid from the vessel itself, or from an external source, including releases from nearby tanks and equipment. For example, rail tank cars have BLEVEd under the effect of a jet fire from the open relief valve of another derailed tank car.


== Hazards ==
The main damaging effects of a BLEVE are three: the blast wave from the explosion; the projection of fragments, or missiles, from the pressure vessel; and the thermal radiation from the fireball, where one occurs.
Horizontal cylindrical (""bullet"") tanks tend to rupture longitudinally. This causes the failed tank and its fragments to get propelled like rockets and travel long distances. At Feyzin, three of the propelled fragments weighed in excess of 100 tons and were thrown 150–350 meters (490–1150 ft) from the source of the explosion. One bullet tank at San Juanico travelled 1,200 meters (0.75 mi) in the air before landing, possibly the farthest ever for a BLEVE missile. Fragments can impact on other tanks or equipment, which may result in a domino effect propagation of the accidental sequence.
Fireballs can rise to significant heights above ground. They are spheroidal when developed and rise from the ground in a mushroom shape. The diameter of fireballs at San Juanico was estimated at 200–300 meters (660–980 ft), with a duration of around 20 seconds. Such massive fires can injure people at distances of hundreds of meters (e.g., 300 m (980 ft) at Feyzin and 400 m (1310 ft) at San Juanico).
An additional hazard from BLEVE-fireball events is the formation of secondary fires, by direct exposure to the fireball thermal radiation, as pool fires from fuel that does not get combusted in the fireball, or from the scattering of blazing tank fragments. Another secondary effect of importance is the dispersion of a toxic gas cloud, if the vapors involved are toxic and do not catch fire upon release. Chlorine, ammonia and phosgene are example of toxic gases that underwent BLEVE in past accidents and produced toxic clouds as a consequence.

Computer compatibility,"A family of computer models is said to be compatible if certain software that runs on one of the models can also be run on all other models of the family. The computer models may differ in performance, reliability or some other characteristic. These differences may affect the outcome of the running of the software.


== Software compatibility ==
Software compatibility can refer to the compatibility that a particular software has running on a particular CPU architecture such as Intel or PowerPC. Software compatibility can also refer to ability for the software to run on a particular operating system. Very rarely is a compiled software compatible with multiple different CPU architectures. Normally, an application is compiled for different CPU architectures and operating systems to allow it to be compatible with the different system. Interpreted software, on the other hand, can normally run on many different CPU architectures and operating systems if the interpreter is available for the architecture or operating system. Software incompatibility occurs many times for new software released for a newer version of an operating system which is incompatible with the older version of the operating system because it may miss some of the features and functionality that the software depends on.


== Hardware compatibility ==
Hardware compatibility can refer to the compatibility of computer hardware components with a particular CPU architecture, bus, motherboard or operating system. Hardware that is compatible may not always run at its highest stated performance, but it can nevertheless work with legacy components. An example is RAM chips, some of which can run at a lower (or sometimes higher) clock rate than rated. Hardware that was designed for one operating system may not work for another, if device or kernel drivers are unavailable. As an example, Android is not able to be run on a phone with iOS. 


== Free and open-source software ==

Sometimes, FOSS is not compatible with proprietary hardware or specific software. This is often due to manufacturers obstructing FOSS such as by not disclosing the interfaces or other specifications needed for members of the FOSS movement to write drivers for their hardware - for instance as they wish customers to run only their own proprietary software or as they might benefit from partnerships.

Pyroligneous acid,"Pyroligneous acid, also called wood vinegar or wood acid, is a dark liquid produced by the destructive distillation of wood and other plant materials.


== Composition ==
The principal components of pyroligneous acid are 10% acetic acid, acetone and methanol. It was once used as a commercial source for acetic acid.


== History ==
Pyroligneous acid (acetum lignorum) was investigated by German chemist Johann Rudolph Glauber. The acid was used as a substitute for vinegar. It was also used topically for treating wounds, ulcers and other ailments. A salt can be made by neutralizing the acid with a lye made from the ashes of the burnt wood.
During the United States Civil War it became increasingly difficult for the Confederate States of America to obtain much needed salt. Curing meat and fish with pyroligneous acid was attempted by cooks to compensate for this deficiency, but it was insufficient.
In the nineteenth century, pyroligneous acid was used to prepare an impure aluminium sulfacetate mordant for use with cotton, but the resulting mixture imparted a burnt odor to the cotton, and Ganswindt recommended its use be abandoned in favour of purer preparations in 1899.
In 1895, pyroligneous acid was first marketed under the brand Wright's Liquid Smoke, a liquid smoke product intended to impart the flavor and some of the preservative effects of wood smoking to meats and vegetables. In the early 21st century, concerns about the carcinogenic effects of components of wood smoke decreased the production of heavily smoked foods in favor of lighter smoking and liquid smoke for foods.

History of astronomy,"The history of astronomy tells how civilizations thought about the sky they saw at night. It also discusses the beginnings of modern astronomy in the history of science.


== Early history ==
Babylonian astronomers viewed the sky as a celestial sphere, far above the Earth.  This sphere had shiny stars on it.  Like earlier astronomers, they organized and named the star patterns as constellations. They took special interest in the seven bright stars that did not stay in any particular constellation.  These were the Star of the Day (Sun), the Star of the Night (Moon), and five planets.  The stars and planets seemed to wander around the celestial sphere, in an area now called the Zodiac. The ancient astronomers carefully recorded the movements they saw.


=== Ancient Greece ===
Greek philosophers, seeing the movement of heavenly bodies, developed models of the Universe based more on empirical evidence. The first model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to this model, space and time are infinite and eternal, the Earth is spherical and stationary, and all other matter is confined to rotating concentric spheres.
This model was brought into agreement with astronomical observations by Ptolemy of Alexandria, in the second century AD. His Syntaxis mathematica, known as the Almagest, was translated from Greek to Arabic, and from Arabic to Latin. It was printed in 1515, with another edition in 1528.
However, not all Greek scientists accepted the geocentric (Earth-centered) model of the Universe. The Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus thought the center of the Universe was a ""central fire"" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.
The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first person to propose a heliocentric (Sun-centered) model of the universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book The Sand Reckoner describes Aristarchus' heliocentric theory. Archimedes wrote: (translated into English)

You King Gelon are aware the 'Universe' is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the 'Universe' just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface.

So, Aristarchus thought the stars were very far away, and he said this was why there was no visible parallax. That is, no one saw movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. Actually. the stars they saw were much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times. Now we know that stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (On the apparent face in the orb of the Moon):

Cleanthes [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the universe [i.e. the Earth], . . . supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis. 
The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia. He was a Babylonian astronomer a century after Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric theory were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.


== Copernicus ==

The geocentric model was accepted in the Western world for about two thousand years. In 1543 Copernicus revived Aristarchus’ theory. Copernicus said (again) that the sun was the center of the Solar System.

In the center rests the sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time? Copernicus Book 1, Chapter 10 of De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum, 1543
As noted by Copernicus himself, the idea that the Earth rotates (goes round on its axis) was very old, dating to Philolaus (c. 450 BC). A century before Copernicus, Nicholas of Cusa proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. (This was in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440).
The first empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274).

Copernicus' heliocentric model allowed the stars to be placed uniformly through the (infinite) space surrounding the planets, as first proposed by Thomas Digges in his Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved (1576). Giordano Bruno accepted the idea that space was infinite and filled with solar systems similar to our own. n; for the publication of his various beliefs, he was burnt at the stake in Rome on 17 February 1600.
This cosmology was accepted provisionally by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists, but it had several paradoxes which were resolved only with general relativity. The first paradox was that it assumed that space and time were infinite, and that the stars in the universe had been burning forever; however, since stars are constantly radiating energy, a finite star seems inconsistent with the radiation of infinite energy. Secondly, Edmund Halley (1720) noted that an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century. Third, Newton himself showed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities crushing matter inwards inwards under gravity. This instability was later clarified in 1902.


== 18th century ==
As observations on the Solar System progressed, some basic facts appeared. All planets go round the Sun in the same direction, and their planes of revolution are very similar. Likewise, most satellites go round planets in nearly the same planes. The planets revolve around their own axes in the same sense in which they orbit the Sun. These regularities cannot be a chance coincidence.
Many were at work trying to use the ideas of Newton and Kepler to explain the observational astronomy provided by the new, larger, telescopes.
A significant astronomical advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright (1711–1786) that the ""fixed stars"" were not scattered at random, but concentrated in what we now call the ""galactic plane"", our view of the Milky Way. What is even more remarkable is his idea that very faint nebulae, in which ""no one star... can possibly be distinguished"" might be extremely distant groups of the same kind.p83/4
Kant (1724–1804), known today for his philosophy, made some important discoveries about the nature of the Earth's rotation. He showed the frictional resistance against tidal currents on the Earth's surface must cause a very gradual slowing of the earth's rotation. The days have grown longer as time has passed. Also, he laid out a nebular hypothesis, in which he deduced that the Solar System formed from a large cloud of gas, a nebula. Following Wright, Kant also thought the Milky Way was a large disk of stars formed from a (much larger) spinning cloud of gas.
The greatest theoretician of the 18th century was Laplace (1749–1827), who worked on the mechanics of the planets and Solar System. His massive 5-volume work on the mechanics of the Solar System explained many of the regularities which observations had discovered. Laplace made good use of another Frenchman's mathematics: Lagrange (1736–1813).
Laplace is also noteworthy for his nebular hypothesis of the evolution of the Solar System. As it happens, the details of Laplace's theory do not quite work out for planetary systems, but they are the basis of how we understand stars condense out of a nebula.
The 18th century was also a century of great observers. William Herschel (1738–1822), helped by his sister Caroline (1750–1848) built the biggest telescope of the day (40-foot), but did his best work on a 20-foot telescope. There were problems with the mirror of the large one. The discovery of Uranus put his career on the way: he got a salary of £200 a year as ""King's Astronomer"". He got a rough idea of where we are in the galaxy, and could see other spiral galaxies. He called them ""island universes"" like the Milky Way. Also he began to work out the motions of different stars. He discovered double stars, and published catalogues of them.p113/120 Herschel's observations brought astronomy into the modern era.


== Modern era ==
The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of the universe.
Two great discoveries changed our picture of the Universe. Both were made by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s. Before then, it was thought that our galaxy, the Milky Way, was the whole universe. Hubble first showed that the Andromeda galaxy was a separate galaxy and similar. Many more galaxies were soon discovered. Later in the 1920s he showed that all distant galaxies were moving away from each other in a general expansion of the universe. He did this by discovering the red shift of spectroscopic light from distant galaxies. That does not apply to galaxies that are clustered together, such as Andromeda which, with our galaxy, is part of the Local Group in the Virgo Supercluster.
Thus what move apart are clusters of galaxies kept together by local gravity.

Data-driven astronomy,"Astroinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of astronomy, data science, machine learning, informatics, and information/communications technologies. The field is closely related to astrostatistics.
Data-driven astronomy (DDA) refers to the use of data science in astronomy. Several outputs of telescopic observations and sky surveys are taken into consideration and approaches related to data mining and big data management are used to analyze, filter, and normalize the data set that are further used for making Classifications, Predictions, and Anomaly detections by advanced Statistical approaches, digital image processing and machine learning. The output of these processes is used by astronomers and space scientists to study and identify patterns, anomalies, and movements in outer space and conclude theories and discoveries in the cosmos.


== Background ==
Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of computational science, data science, machine learning, and statistics for research and education in data-oriented astronomy. Early efforts in this direction included data discovery, metadata standards development, data modeling, astronomical data dictionary development, data access, information retrieval, data integration, and data mining in the astronomical Virtual Observatory initiatives. Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the National Research Council (United States) in 2009 in the astroinformatics ""state of the profession"" position paper for the 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education.
Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of Geoinformatics, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, and through the eScience work of Jim Gray (computer scientist) at Microsoft Research, whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.
Although the primary focus of astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to digitize historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large database for efficient retrieval through web-based interfaces. Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.
Astroinformatics is described as the ""fourth paradigm"" of astronomical research. There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science. Data mining and machine learning play significant roles in astroinformatics as a scientific research discipline due to their focus on ""knowledge discovery from data"" (KDD) and ""learning from data"".
The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and into the exabytes with the Square Kilometre Array. This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.
Informatics has been recently defined as ""the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation"". However the usual, or commonly used definition is ""informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support."" Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., taxonomies, ontologies, folksonomies, and/or collaborative tagging) plus Astrostatistics will also be heavily involved. Citizen science projects (such as Galaxy Zoo) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.
In 2007, the Galaxy Zoo project was launched for morphological classification of a large number of galaxies. In this project, 900,000 images were considered for classification that were taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for the past 7 years. The task was to study each picture of a galaxy, classify it as elliptical or spiral, and determine whether it was spinning or not. The team of Astrophysicists led by Kevin Schawinski in Oxford University were in charge of this project and Kevin and his colleague Chris Linlott figured out that it would take a period of 3–5 years for such a team to complete the work. There they came up with the idea of using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques for analyzing the images and classifying them.
In 2012, two position papers were presented to the Council of the American Astronomical Society that led to the establishment of formal working groups in astroinformatics and Astrostatistics for the profession of astronomy within the US and elsewhere.
Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research. The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow data literacy through the easy re-use of data. It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.


== Methodology ==
The data retrieved from the sky surveys are first brought for data preprocessing. In this, redundancies are removed and filtrated. Further, feature extraction is performed on this filtered data set, which is further taken for processes. Some of the renowned sky surveys are listed below:

The Palomar Digital Sky Survey (DPOSS)
The Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)
Green Bank Telescope (GBT)
The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey (SMSS)
The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (PanSTARRS)
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
The Square Kilometer Array (SKA)
The size of data from the above-mentioned sky surveys ranges from 3 TB to almost 4.6 EB. Further, data mining tasks that are involved in the management and manipulation of the data involve methods like classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and time-series analysis. Several approaches and applications for each of these methods are involved in the task accomplishments.

Mortice and tenon,"A mortice (or mortise) and tenon joint is a type of joint that connects two pieces of wood or other material. Carpenters  have used it for thousands of years to join pieces of wood. It is used when the adjoining pieces connect at an angle of 90°. 
In its basic form, it is simple and strong. There are many variations. The basic mortice and tenon has two parts: the mortice hole and the tenon tongue. The tenon, on the end of a member (called a rail), fits into a square or rectangular hole in the corresponding member. The tenon is cut to fit the mortice hole exactly and usually has shoulders that seat when the joint fully enters the mortice hole. The joint may be glued, pinned, or wedged to lock it in place.
This joint is also used with other materials.  For example, it is a traditional method for stonemasons and blacksmiths.",0
Outline of animation,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to animation:
Animation – rapid display of a sequence of images of 2-D artwork or model positions in order to create an illusion of movement.

SN 2018gv,"NGC 2525 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Puppis. It is located at a distance of about 70 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 2525 is about 60,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on February 23, 1791.
The galaxy has a bar and two main spiral arms with high surface brightness. HII regions are observed in the arms. The brightest stars of the galaxy have apparent magnitude around 22. Its nucleus is small and bright. In the centre of the galaxy is predicted to lie a supermassive black hole whose age is estimated to be between 1.1 and 44 million years, based on the spiral arm pitch angle.

One supernova has been observed in NGC 2525, SN 2018gv. It was discovered on 15 January 2018 at magnitude 16.5, and it was identified spectrographically as a type Ia supernova 10 to 15 days before maximum. The supernova was also observed by ATLAS on 2018 January 14.5 UT at magnitude 18.1. It reached a peak magnitude of 12.8. A video of the supernova was released.

Firestorm,"A firestorm is a conflagration which attains such intensity that it creates and sustains its own wind system. It is most commonly a natural phenomenon, created during some of the largest bushfires and wildfires. Although the term has been used to describe certain large fires, the phenomenon's determining characteristic is a fire with its own storm-force winds from every point of the compass towards the storm's center, where the air is heated and then ascends. 
The Black Saturday bushfires, the 2021 British Columbia wildfires, and the Great Peshtigo Fire are possible examples of forest fires with some portion of combustion due to a firestorm, as is the Great Hinckley Fire. Firestorms have also occurred in cities, usually due to targeted explosives, such as in the aerial firebombings of London, Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.


== Mechanism ==

 
A firestorm is created as a result of the stack effect as the heat of the original fire draws in more and more of the surrounding air. This draft can be quickly increased if a low-level jet stream exists over or near the fire. As the updraft mushrooms, strong inwardly-directed gusty winds develop around the fire, supplying it with additional air. This would seem to prevent the firestorm from spreading on the wind, but the tremendous turbulence created may also cause the strong surface inflow winds to change direction erratically. Firestorms resulting from the bombardment of urban areas in the Second World War were generally confined to the areas initially seeded with incendiary devices, and the firestorm did not appreciably spread outward. 
A firestorm may also develop into a mesocyclone and induce true tornadoes/fire whirls. This occurred with the 2002 Durango fire, and probably with the much greater Peshtigo Fire. The greater draft of a firestorm draws in greater quantities of oxygen, which significantly increases combustion, thereby also substantially increasing the production of heat. The intense heat of a firestorm manifests largely as radiated heat (infrared radiation), which may ignite flammable material at a distance ahead of the fire itself. This also serves to expand the area and the intensity of the firestorm. Violent, erratic wind drafts suck movables into the fire and as is observed with all intense conflagrations, radiated heat from the fire can melt some metals, glass, and turn street tarmac into flammable hot liquid. The very high temperatures ignite anything that might possibly burn, until the firestorm runs low on fuel.
A firestorm does not appreciably ignite material at a distance ahead of itself; more accurately, the heat desiccates those materials and makes them more vulnerable to ignition by embers or firebrands, increasing the rate of fire spotting. During the formation of a firestorm many fires merge to form a single convective column of hot gases rising from the burning area and strong, fire-induced, radial (inwardly directed) winds are associated with the convective column. Thus the fire front is essentially stationary and the outward spread of fire is prevented by the in-rushing wind.


== Characterization of a firestorm ==
A firestorm is characterized by strong to gale-force winds blowing toward the fire, everywhere around the fire perimeter, an effect which is caused by the buoyancy of the rising column of hot gases over the intense mass fire, drawing in cool air from the periphery. These winds from the perimeter blow the fire brands into the burning area and tend to cool the unignited fuel outside the fire area so that ignition of material outside the periphery by radiated heat and fire embers is more difficult, thus limiting fire spread. At Hiroshima, this inrushing to feed the fire is said to have prevented the firestorm perimeter from expanding, and thus the firestorm was confined to the area of the city damaged by the blast.

Large wildfire conflagrations are distinct from firestorms if they have moving fire fronts which are driven by the ambient wind and do not develop their own wind system like true firestorms. (This does not mean that a firestorm must be stationary; as with any other convective storm, the circulation may follow surrounding pressure gradients and winds, if those lead it onto fresh fuel sources.) Furthermore, non-firestorm conflagrations can develop from a single ignition, whereas firestorms have only been observed where large numbers of fires are burning simultaneously over a relatively large area, with the important caveat that the density of simultaneously burning fires needs to be above a critical threshold for a firestorm to form (a notable example of large numbers of fires burning simultaneously over a large area without a firestorm developing was the Kuwaiti oil fires of 1991, where the distance between individual fires was too large).
The high temperatures within the firestorm zone ignite most everything that might possibly burn, until a tipping point is reached, that is, upon running low on fuel, which occurs after the firestorm has consumed so much of the available fuel within the firestorm zone that the necessary fuel density required to keep the firestorm's wind system active drops below the threshold level, at which time the firestorm breaks up into isolated conflagrations.
In Australia, the prevalence of eucalyptus trees that have oil in their leaves results in forest fires that are noted for their extremely tall and intense flame front. Hence the bush fires appear more as a firestorm than a simple forest fire. Sometimes, emission of combustible gases from swamps (e.g., methane) has a similar effect. For instance, methane explosions enforced the Peshtigo Fire.


=== Weather and climate effects ===
Firestorms will produce hot buoyant smoke clouds of primarily water vapor that will form condensation clouds as it enters the cooler upper atmosphere, generating what is known as pyrocumulus clouds (""fire clouds"") or, if large enough, pyrocumulonimbus (""fire storm"") clouds. For example, the black rain that began to fall approximately 20 minutes after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima produced in total 5–10 cm of black soot-filled rain in a 1–3 hour period. Moreover, if the conditions are right, a large pyrocumulus can grow into a pyrocumulonimbus and produce lightning, which could potentially set off further fires. Apart from city and forest fires, pyrocumulus clouds can also be produced by volcanic eruptions due to the comparable amounts of hot buoyant material formed.
On a more continental and global extent, away from the direct vicinity of the fire, wildfire firestorms that produce pyrocumulonimbus cloud events have been found to ""surprisingly frequently"" generate minor ""nuclear winter"" effects. These are analogous to minor volcanic winters, with each mass addition of volcanic gases additive in increasing the depth of the ""winter"" cooling, from near-imperceptible to ""year without a summer"" levels.


==== Pyro-cumulonimbus and atmospheric effects (in wildfires) ====
A very important but poorly understood aspect of wildfire behavior are pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorm dynamics and their atmospheric impact. These are well illustrated in the Black Saturday case study below. The ""pyroCb"" is a fire-started or fire-augmented thunderstorm that in its most extreme manifestation injects huge abundances of smoke and other biomass-burning emissions into the lower stratosphere. The observed hemispheric spread of smoke and other biomass-burning emissions has known important climate consequences. Direct attribution of the stratospheric aerosols to pyroCbs only occurred in the last decade.
Such an extreme injection by thunderstorms was previously judged to be unlikely because the extratropical tropopause is considered to be a strong barrier to convection. Two recurring themes have developed as pyroCb research unfolds. First, puzzling stratospheric aerosol-layer observations—and other layers reported as volcanic aerosol can now be explained in terms of pyroconvection. Second, pyroCb events occur surprisingly frequently, and they are likely a relevant aspect of several historic wildfires.
On an intraseasonal level it is established that pyroCbs occur with surprising frequency. In 2002, at least 17 pyroCbs erupted in North America alone. Still to be determined is how often this process occurred in the boreal forests of Asia in 2002. However, it is now established that this most extreme form of pyroconvection, along with more frequent pyrocumulus convection, was widespread and persisted for at least two months. The characteristic injection height of pyroCb emissions is the upper troposphere, and a subset of these storms pollutes the lower stratosphere. Thus, a new appreciation for the role of extreme wildfire behavior and its atmospheric ramifications is now coming into focus.


=== Black Saturday firestorm (Wildfire case study) ===


==== Background ====
The Black Saturday bushfires are some of Australia's most destructive and deadly fires that fall under the category of a ""firestorm"" due to the extreme fire behavior and relationship with atmospheric responses that occurred during the fires. This major wildfire event led to a number of distinct electrified pyrocumulonimbus plume clusters ranging roughly 15 km high. These plumes were proven susceptible to striking new spot fires ahead of the main fire front. The newly ignited fires by this pyrogenic lightning further highlight the feedback loops of influence between the atmosphere and fire behavior on Black Saturday associated with these pyroconvective processes.


==== Role that pyroCbs have on fire in case study ====
The examinations presented here for Black Saturday demonstrate that fires ignited by lightning generated within the fire plume can occur at much larger distances ahead of the main fire front—of up to 100 km. In comparison to fires ignited by burning debris transported by the fire plume, these only go ahead of the fire front up to about 33 km, noting that this also has implications in relation to understanding the maximum rate of spread of a wildfire. This finding is important for the understanding and modeling of future firestorms and the large scale areas that can be affected by this phenomenon. 
As the individual spot fires grow together, they will begin to interact. This interaction will increase the burning rates, heat release rates, and flame height until the distance between them reaches a critical level. At the critical separation distance, the flames will begin to merge and burn with the maximum rate and flame height. As these spot fires continue to grow together, the burning and heat release rates will finally start to decrease but remain at a much elevated level compared to the independent spot fire. The flame height is not expected to change significantly. The more spot fires, the bigger the increase in burning rate and flame height.


==== Importance for continued study of these firestorms ====
Black Saturday is just one of many varieties of firestorms with these pyroconvective processes and they are still being widely studied and compared. In addition to indicating this strong coupling on Black Saturday between the atmosphere and the fire activity, the lightning observations also suggest considerable differences in pyroCb characteristics between Black Saturday and the Canberra fire event. Differences between pyroCb events, such as for the Black Saturday and Canberra cases, indicate considerable potential for improved understanding of pyroconvection based on combining different data sets as presented in the research of the Black Saturday pyroCb's (including in relation to lightning, radar, precipitation, and satellite observations).
A greater understanding of pyroCb activity is important, given that fire-atmosphere feedback processes can exacerbate the conditions associated with dangerous fire behavior. Additionally, understanding the combined effects of heat, moisture, and aerosols on cloud microphysics is important for a range of weather and climate processes, including in relation to improved modeling and prediction capabilities. It is essential to fully explore events such as these to properly characterize the fire behavior, pyroCb dynamics, and resultant influence on conditions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). It is also important to accurately characterize this transport process so that cloud, chemistry, and climate models have a firm basis on which to evaluate the pyrogenic source term, pathway from the boundary layer through cumulus cloud, and exhaust from the convective column.
Since the discovery of smoke in the stratosphere and the pyroCb, only a small number of individual case studies and modeling experiments have been performed. Hence, there is still much to be learned about the pyroCb and its importance. With this work scientists have attempted to reduce the unknowns by revealing several additional occasions when pyroCbs were either a significant or sole cause for the type of stratospheric pollution usually attributed to volcanic injections.


== City firestorms ==

The same underlying combustion physics can also apply to man-made structures such as cities during war or natural disaster.
Firestorms are thought to have been part of the mechanism of large urban fires, such as accompanied the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Genuine firestorms are occurring more frequently in California wildfires, such as the 1991 wildfire disaster in Oakland, California, and the October 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California. 
During the July–August 2018 Carr Fire, a deadly fire vortex equivalent in size and strength to an EF-3 tornado spawned during the firestorm in Redding, California and caused tornado-like wind damage. Another wildfire which may be characterized as a firestorm was the Camp Fire, which at one point travelled at a speed of up to 76 acres per minute, completely destroying the town of Paradise, California within 24 hours on November 8, 2018.
Firestorms were also created by the firebombing raids of World War II in cities like Hamburg and Dresden. Of the two nuclear weapons used in combat, only Hiroshima resulted in a firestorm. In contrast, experts suggest that due to the nature of modern U.S. city design and construction, a firestorm is unlikely after a nuclear detonation.


=== Firebombing ===

Firebombing is a technique designed to damage a target, generally an urban area, through the use of fire, caused by incendiary devices, rather than from the blast effect of large bombs. Such raids often employ both incendiary devices and high explosives. The high explosive destroys roofs, making it easier for the incendiary devices to penetrate the structures and cause fires. The high explosives also disrupt the ability of firefighters to douse the fires.
Although incendiary bombs have been used to destroy buildings since the start of gunpowder warfare, World War II saw the first use of strategic bombing from the air to destroy the ability of the enemy to wage war. London, Coventry, and many other British cities were firebombed during the Blitz. Most large German cities were extensively firebombed starting in 1942, and almost all large Japanese cities were firebombed during the last six months of World War II. As Sir Arthur Harris, the officer commanding RAF Bomber Command from 1942 through to the end of the war in Europe, pointed out in his post-war analysis, although many attempts were made to create deliberate man-made firestorms during World War II, few attempts succeeded:

""The Germans again and again missed their chance, ...of setting our cities ablaze by a concentrated attack. Coventry was adequately concentrated in point of space, but all the same there was little concentration in point of time, and nothing like the fire tornadoes of Hamburg or Dresden ever occurred in this country. But they did do us enough damage to teach us the principle of concentration, the principle of starting so many fires at the same time that no fire fighting services, however efficiently and quickly they were reinforced by the fire brigades of other towns could get them under control.""
According to physicist David Hafemeister, firestorms occurred after about 5% of all fire-bombing raids during World War II (but he does not explain if this is a percentage based on both Allied and Axis raids, or combined Allied raids, or U.S. raids alone). In 2005, the American National Fire Protection Association stated in a report that three major firestorms resulted from Allied conventional bombing campaigns during World War II: Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo. They do not include the comparatively minor firestorms at Kassel, Darmstadt or even Ube into their major firestorm category. Despite later quoting and corroborating Glasstone and Dolan and data collected from these smaller firestorms:

based on World War II experience with mass fires resulting from air raids on Germany and Japan, the minimum requirements for a firestorm to develop are considered by some authorities to be the following: (1) at least 8 pounds of combustibles per square foot of fire area (40 kg per square meter), (2) at least half of the structures in the area on fire simultaneously, (3) a wind of less than 8 miles per hour at the time, and (4) a minimum burning area of about half a square mile.


=== 21st-century cities in comparison to World War II cities ===

Unlike the highly combustible World War II cities that firestormed from conventional and nuclear weapons, a FEMA report suggests that due to the nature of modern U.S. city design and construction, a firestorm is unlikely to occur even after a nuclear detonation because highrise buildings do not lend themselves to the formation of firestorms because of the baffle effect of the structures, and firestorms are unlikely in areas whose modern buildings have totally collapsed, with the exceptions of Tokyo and Hiroshima, because of the nature of their densely-packed ""flimsy"" wooden buildings in World War II.
There is also a sizable difference between the fuel loading of World War II cities that firestormed and that of modern cities, where the quantity of combustibles per square meter in the fire area in the latter is below the necessary requirement for a firestorm to form (40 kg/m2). Therefore, firestorms are not to be expected in modern North American cities after a nuclear detonation, and are expected to be unlikely in modern European cities.
Similarly, one reason for the lack of success in creating a true firestorm in the bombing of Berlin in World War II was that the building density in Berlin was too low to support easy fire spread from building to building. Another reason was that much of the building construction was newer and better than in most of the old German city centers. Modern building practices in the Berlin of World War II led to more effective firewalls and fire-resistant construction. Mass firestorms never proved to be possible in Berlin. No matter how heavy the raid or what kinds of firebombs were dropped, no true firestorm ever developed.


== Nuclear weapons in comparison to conventional weapons ==
The incendiary effects of a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features. In principle, the same overall result with respect to destruction of life and property can be achieved by the use of conventional incendiary and high-explosive bombs. It has been estimated, for example, that the same fire ferocity and damage produced at Hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single B-29 could have instead been produced by about 1,200 tons/1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 B-29s distributed over the city; for Nagasaki, a single 21 kiloton nuclear bomb dropped on the city could have been estimated to be caused by 1,200 tons of incendiary bombs from 125 B-29s.
It may seem counterintuitive that the same amount of fire damage caused by a nuclear weapon could have instead been produced by smaller total yield of thousands of incendiary bombs; however, World War II experience supports this assertion. For example, although not a perfect clone of the city of Hiroshima in 1945, in the conventional bombing of Dresden, the combined Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped a total of 3441.3 tons (approximately 3.4 kilotons) of ordnance (about half of which was incendiary bombs) on the night of 13–14 February 1945, and this resulted in ""more than"" 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2) of the city being destroyed by fire and firestorm effects according to one authoritative source, or approximately 8 square miles (21 km2) by another. 
In total about 4.5 kilotons of conventional ordnance was dropped on the city over a number of months during 1945 and this resulted in approximately 15 square miles (39 km2) of the city being destroyed by blast and fire effects. During the Operation MeetingHouse firebombing of Tokyo on 9–10 March 1945, 279 of the 334 B-29s dropped 1,665 tons of incendiary and high-explosive bombs on the city, resulting in the destruction of over 10,000 acres of buildings—16 square miles (41 km2), a quarter of the city. 
In contrast to these raids, when a single 16-kiloton nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, 4.5 square miles (12 km2) of the city was destroyed by blast, fire, and firestorm effects. Similarly, Major Cortez F. Enloe, a surgeon in the USAAF who worked with the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), said that the 21-kiloton nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki did not do as much fire damage as the extended conventional airstrikes on Hamburg.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

American historian Gabriel Kolko also echoed this sentiment:

During November 1944 American B-29's began their first incendiary bomb raids on Tokyo, and on 9 March 1945, wave upon wave dropped masses of small incendiaries containing an early version of napalm on the city's population....Soon small fires spread, connected, grew into a vast firestorm that sucked the oxygen out of the lower atmosphere. The bomb raid was a 'success' for the Americans; they killed 125,000 Japanese in one attack. The Allies bombed Hamburg and Dresden in the same manner, and Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and Tokyo again on May 24....in fact the atomic bomb used against Hiroshima was less lethal than massive fire bombing....Only its technique was novel—nothing more....There was another difficulty posed by mass conventional bombing, and that was its very success, a success that made the two modes of human destruction qualitatively identical in fact and in the minds of the American military. ""I was a little fearful"", [Secretary of War] Stimson told [President] Truman, ""that before we could get ready the Air Force might have Japan so thoroughly bombed out that the new weapon would not have a fair background to show its strength."" To this the President ""laughed and said he understood.""

This break from the linear expectation of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors. First, the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal for the creation of fires. In an incendiary bombing raid, incendiary weapons followed after high-explosive blast weapons were dropped, in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a limited quantity of explosive and incendiary weapons. The so-called two-ton ""cookies"", also known as ""blockbusters"", were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains, as well as to blow off roofs, doors, and windows, creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped, ideally, into holes created by the prior blast weapons, such as into attic and roof spaces. 
On the other hand, nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order, with thermal effects and ""flash"" occurring first, which are then followed by the slower blast wave. It is for this reason that conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield. It is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts Franklin D'Olier, Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan to state that the same fire damage suffered at Hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton/1,000 tons of incendiary bombs.
The second factor explaining the non-intuitive break in the expected results of greater explosive yield producing greater city fire damage is that city fire damage is largely dependent not on the yield of the weapons used, but on the conditions in and around the city itself, with the fuel loading per square meter value of the city being one of the major factors. A few hundred strategically placed incendiary devices would be sufficient to start a firestorm in a city if the conditions for a firestorm, namely high fuel loading, are already inherent to the city (see Bat bomb). 
The Great Fire of London in 1666, although not forming a firestorm due to the single point of ignition, serves as an example that, given a densely packed and predominantly wooden and thatch building construction in the urban area, a mass fire is conceivable from the mere incendiary power of no more than a domestic fireplace. On the other hand, the largest nuclear weapon conceivable (more than a gigaton blast yield) will be incapable of igniting a city into a firestorm if the city's properties, namely its fuel density, are not conducive to one developing. It's worth remembering that such a device would still destroy any city in the world today from its shockwave alone, as well as irradiate the ruins to the point of uninhabitability. A device so large could even vaporize the city (and the crust beneath) all at once without such damage qualifying as a ""firestorm"". 
Despite the disadvantage of nuclear weapons when compared to conventional weapons of lower or comparable yield in terms of effectiveness at starting fires, for the reasons discussed above, one undeniable advantage of nuclear weapons over conventional weapons when it comes to creating fires is that nuclear weapons undoubtedly produce all their thermal and explosive effects in a very short period of time. That is, to use Arthur Harris's terminology, they are the epitome of an air raid guaranteed to be concentrated in ""point in time"". 
In contrast, early in World War II, the ability to achieve conventional air raids concentrated in ""point of time"" depended largely upon the skill of pilots to remain in formation, and their ability to hit the target whilst at times also being under heavy fire from anti-aircraft fire from the cities below. Nuclear weapons largely remove these uncertain variables. Therefore, nuclear weapons reduce the question of whether a city will firestorm or not to a smaller number of variables, to the point of becoming entirely reliant on the intrinsic properties of the city, such as fuel loading, and predictable atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed, in and around the city, and less reliant on the unpredictable possibility of hundreds of bomber crews acting together successfully as a single unit.

Procedural animation,"Procedural animation refers to rule-based or algorithmic methods of creating computer graphics animation.


== Procedural animation vs. traditional animation ==
With traditional animation method,  principal animation poses are specified by an animator at a specific point in the animation timeline. By setting these poses, an animator can artistically direct how the geometry will be framed in some key events. These poses are in the same sense as how a person may pose for a photography session. Shapes and objects in computer graphics are considered as geometry. With key events specified, the animation software will then automatically fill the intermediary motions between key points, thereby creating continuous motion throughout the timeline without requiring additional works by an animator.
Procedural animation is a rule-base approach to creating animations. These rules are typically some form of mathematical or statistical functions which tell the animation software how an object is to be animated. In order for the geometry to be animated, these functions typically require some form of time-based variable as its input. Therefore, one can apply a chain of logical rules and algorithms to create animations without manually specify any key poses.


== Procedural modeling ==
In computer graphics, modeling refers to an act of digitally sculpting a model. Procedural modeling then refers to same rule-based, algorithmic approach to creating geometry. Procedural modeling differs from procedural animation in that a time-based variable is not required.


== Proceduralism ==
Amongst some animators within the computer graphics industry, procedural modeling and animation method is also known as proceduralism.


== Advantages and disadvantages of proceduralism ==
In order to maximize artistic impact of their craft, animators employ traditional animation techniques to set poses manually at a specific point in time. When the objects to be animated become significantly more complex, traditional animation techniques may not be feasible. Therefore, proceduralism offers significant advantage as complexities increase significantly. While proceduralism enables its practitioners to create infinite variation of models and animations, specific key pose is often left as random chance. Computer graphics animators must decide between the combinations of both techniques in order to achieve the desired outcome.


== Applications of procedural animation ==
Procedural animation is used extensively in visual effects for movie and gaming industry where animation data and geometry must be generated with certain random probability in order to simulate the physical world.",0

Touristification,"Touristification is a process by which a place changes as it becomes an object of tourist consumption. It leads to negative implications for the touristified place and has received both informal and formal opposition.


== Cause ==
Touristification has come about as transport has improved. In the modern age, it is quicker and cheaper to travel than ever, leading to more international (and national) trips such as city breaks.


== Housing ==

The growth of the peer-to-peer rental market (platforms such as Airbnb) have led to the touristification of housing in many cities, with the peer-to-peer market now present in almost every European city. The growth in peer-to-peer holiday rentals is becoming a 'gentrification battlefront' both in the Global North and South.
In the peer-to-peer rental market, individuals can occasionally rent out the homes in which they live through a platform such as Airbnb. However, these platforms have been criticised for allowing investors and landlords to set up permanent holiday rentals in homes which would otherwise form part of the local housing stock. This is a form of gentrification, as local city dwellers are displaced from their homes (or districts) to cater for the needs of affluent (in this case, transient and mobile) people. Lestégas refers to districts which have become dominated by holiday rentals as airbnbarrios.
The production of a short-term rental housing market in cities became pivotal in the early 2000s. This came about due to the increasing importance of digital technologies in the economy, and a drive by capital to extract more value from the city.


== Solastalgia ==
Solastalgia is the collective melancholia that a community feels when its space is touristified. Solastalgic people feel deprived when their daily activities are altered or restricted to cater for a more affluent tourist class and yearn for the past pre-mass tourism.


== Opposition ==
Touristification has received protests from negatively affected groups. In some cities, anti-Airbnb billboards have appeared. In some cases, cities across the world have directly taken on Airbnb and similar organisations. In August 2021, Barcelona became the first city to ban short-term private room rentals.

RNU4-2 syndrome,"RNU4-2 Syndrome or ReNU syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo variants in the human gene RNU4-2, which encodes an RNA component of the major spliceosome. It is characterized by hypotonia, global developmental delay, severely impaired intellectual development with poor or absent speech, delayed walking or inability to walk, feeding difficulties with poor overall growth, dysmorphic facial features, and brain anomalies, including ventriculomegaly.
RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome is one of the most prevalent monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, with variants in RNU4-2 estimated to account for around 0.4% of all neurodevelopmental disorders. The syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by de novo variants in RNU4-2, a gene on chromosome 12, which encodes the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U4. U4 is a component of the major spliceosome, a complex of proteins and non-coding RNAs that is necessary for RNA splicing. Most cases of RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome are explained by a 1-bp insertion (n.64_65insT, NR_003137.2), which is thought to disrupt the interactions of snRNA U4 with the snRNA U6, affecting the stability of the ACAGAGA loop of U6 sRNA which binds 5' splice sites and induces splicing after U4-U6 unwinding. Disrupted splicing, in particular a change in 5' splice site usage, has been reported in individuals with variants in RNU4-2.
The genetic etiology of RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome was first described in a preprint in April 2024. It was subsequently published by two research teams independently, both who used data collected by Genomics England. One team, led by the English statistician Daniel Greene working at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, used a Bayesian analysis. The other team involved a global collaboration led by Yuyang Chen and Nicola Whiffin of the University of Oxford.
Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, brain anomalies, distinctive facies, and absent language (NEDHAFA) was a suggested name for this syndrome, however, ReNU syndrome (pronounced 'renew') was chosen through a collaboration between researchers and the families of those impacted by variants in RNU4-2. The name symbolises that this diagnosis “renews” hope for a brighter future for all those affected.

Moai kavakava,"A mo‘ai kavakava is a small wooden figure of a style originated by the Rapa Nui culture of Easter Island.
Each figure resembles a standing, slightly stooped, male human with an emaciated body.
The name mo‘ai kavakava is formed from mo‘ai for the monumental monolithic human figures found on Easter Island and the word kavakava meaning ribs. Little is known about the cultural context of these figures although they are generally considered to be representations of starving ancestors or demons. 19th century travelers reported that these figures were worn hanging around the necks of men who took part in the ritual dances during public ceremonies.
German Expressionist Max Ernst was inspired by these figures and their rituals. The figures can also be found in the collections of the French surrealist André Breton.

Reckless burning,"Reckless burning is a crime that involves illegally setting fire to something not of building proportions, such as leaves or trash. It is a lesser charge than arson.

Pyrophilia,"Pyrophilia is a relatively uncommon paraphilia in which a subject derives gratification from fire and fire-starting activity. It is distinguished from pyromania by the gratification being of a sexual nature.


== Description ==
While the erotic focus immediately raises the diagnostic issue of pyromania, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV classifies this disorder as an impulse-control disorder, with nothing to indicate or suggest an overlap between this disorder and the paraphilias.
Other than the purposeful act of fire-setting itself, there is no mention of the possibility that the tension or affective arousal experienced before the act; the fascination with, interest in, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (for example, paraphernalia, uses, consequences); or the pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting, witnessing, or participating in the aftermath of fires might be sexual in nature or even contain a sexual arousal component.
Some described cases of pyrophilia do not include behaviors commonly associated with pyromania, such as being a regular “watcher” at fires in their neighbourhood; setting off false alarms; deriving pleasure from institutions, equipment, and personnel associated with fire, spending time at the local fire station, setting fires in order to be affiliated with the fire department; and either showing indifference to the consequences to life and property caused by the fire or deriving satisfaction from the resulting destruction of property. Sexual gratification need not involve actual fire; arousal or masturbatory aids may include fantasies or talk of setting a fire. In other instances, the patient may derive arousal primarily from setting or watching their fire.
Pyrophilia has been diagnosed in very few instances, and is not fully accepted by the general psychological community.

Animated mapping,"Animated mapping is the application of animation, either a computer or video, to add a temporal component to a map displaying change in some dimension. Most commonly the change is shown over time, generally at a greatly changed scale (either much faster than real-time or much slower). An example would be the animation produced after the 2004 tsunami showing how the waves spread across the Indian Ocean.


== History ==
The concept of animated maps began in the 1930s but did not become more developed by cartographers until the 1950s. In 1959, Norman Thrower published Animated Cartography, discussing the use of animated maps in adding a new dimension that was difficult to express in static maps: time. These early maps were created by drawing ""snap-shots"" of static maps, putting a series of maps together to form a scene, and creating animation through photography tricks (Thrower 1959). Such early maps rarely had an associated scale, legends or oriented themselves to lines of longitude or latitude.
With the development of computers in the 1960s and 1970s, animation programs were developed allowing the growth of animation in mapping. Waldo Tobler created one of the first computer-generated map animations, using a 3-D computer-generated map to portray population growth over a specified time in Detroit. Hal Moellering created another animated map in 1976 representing a spatiotemporal pattern in traffic accidents.
Further development in the animated maps was stalled until the 1990s due to a lack of animation in academics, financial restrictions on research, and lack of distribution means. In the 1990s, however, the invention of faster, more efficient computers, compact discs, and the Internet solved such problems. Today, there are many free options for hosting animated maps online, including YouTube and GitHub. Internet GIS and web mapping both make extensive use of animated maps, particularly when showing time. Because of the nature of the internet, this may lead to the distribution of misinformation and contribute to the infodemic.


== Visual variables ==

With the growth of animated mapping came the development of guidelines for creating animated maps. Visual variables such as spacing, lightness, and shape used for static maps apply. However, in 1991, David DiBiase and colleagues developed visual variables unique to animated maps: duration, rate of change, and order. Duration is the unit of time a frame or scene is displayed, affecting the smoothness of the animation. The shorter a frame is displayed, the smoother the animation will appear. Smoothness of animation is also a function of the rate of change. Order refers to the time sequence in which animation is played out, usually presented in chronological sequence. Alan MacEachren extended these visual variables in 1995 to include display date (time at which change is initiated), frequency (number of times identifiable forms are displayed), and synchronization (correspondence of 2 or more time series).


== Types ==
Animated maps can emphasize the existence of an occurrence at a location, emphasize an attribute of an occurrence, or represent a change in the position or attributes of an occurrence. For instance, a flashing symbol may be used to draw the map-reader's attention to a particular occurrence at one location or multiple locations across the map. Maps on the weather channel use animation to emphasize the current and predicted paths of hurricanes.
The use of the Internet has allowed animated maps to become interactive. The user can witness representations of changes over time, while manipulating the direction of view, the pace or the parameters of the map displayed.
Animation on maps can be mainly divided into two types: temporal and non-temporal.


=== Temporal map animation ===

Temporal map animation shows the ongoing gradual changes over time. Temporal maps can also be termed animated timeline maps and can be a useful reference to examine the changes ongoing on each step and analyze the progression occurring gradually as time passes.
There are many purposes which temporal animation might serve to depict: displaying and analyzing geographic patterns, meteorological events, climate, natural disasters, and other multivariate data.


==== Animated mapping of history ====
Animated mapping is extensively used in the construction of animated maps to depict historical events in a cartographic environment, particularly in the subdiscipline of Historical geographic information system. These were one of the first applications of such maps, documented in Waldo Tobler's 1970 paper. Today, such animations often show the land ownership/occupation of specific groups over time.


=== Importance of legend in temporal maps ===
As in the case of static maps, it would be useful if temporal maps could also be provided with proper legend. Legends for temporal maps should not only tell the time but also let users travel over time. Various manipulations such as traveling to a certain point in time, selecting focus level, etc. should be allowed to enhance user-friendliness.
Using legend in the temporal map will answer important questions related to the entity's existence (if?), the entity's location (when?), time intervals (how long?), temporal texture (how often), the speed at which change takes place (how fast?), and the order of change (what order?).
Depending upon their construction, animated legends may distract the viewer from the animated map. Care must be taken to integrate the legend unobtrusively.


=== Non-temporal map animation ===
Non-temporal map animation shows changes against some other variables other than time. The variable might be a place, position, generalization level, etc. Non–temporal animation also serves when there is a need to show both the data set and the transformation that has been applied to it for its display.
Non-temporal animation can be of many types according to the purpose they serve:

Fly through animation
This type of animation gives the viewer the feeling of flying through the landscape.
Cartographic zoom animation
This type of animation shows maps at different focus levels and viewers can change the scale of the map as desired.
Classification animation
Different methods of data classification are depicted in this animation.
Generalization animation
This type of animation uses a single classification method with multiple classes of data.
Time is an important aspect in both animations. Real-time is depicted in temporal animation and presentation time (time to show the animation) is associated with non-temporal animation.

Board foot,"The board foot or board-foot is a unit of measurement for the volume of lumber in the United States and Canada. It equals the volume of a board that is one foot (30.5 cm) in length, one foot (30.5 cm) in width, and one inch (2.54 cm) in thickness, or exactly 2.359737216 liters.
Board foot can be abbreviated as FBM (for ""foot, board measure""), BDFT, or BF. A thousand board feet can be abbreviated as MFBM, MBFT, or MBF. Similarly, a million board feet can be abbreviated as MMFBM, MMBFT, or MMBF.
Until the 1970s, in Australia and New Zealand, the terms super foot and superficial foot were used with the same meaning.


== Description ==
One board foot equals:

1 ft × 1 ft × 1 in
12 in × 12 in × 1 in
12 ft × 1 in × 1 in
144 cu in
1⁄12 cu ft
≈ 2,360 cubic centimeters
≈ 2.360 liters
≈ 0.002360 cubic meters or steres
1⁄1980 Petrograd Standard of board


== Usage ==

The board foot is used to measure rough lumber (before drying and planing with no adjustments) or planed/surfaced lumber. An example of planed lumber is softwood ""two by four"" lumber sold by large lumber retailers, nominally 2 by 4 inches (50 mm × 100 mm). The 2 × 4 is actually only 1+1⁄2 in × 3+1⁄2 in (38 mm × 89 mm), but the dimensions for the lumber when purchased wholesale could still be represented as full 2 × 4 lumber, although the ""standard"" can vary between vendors. This means that nominal lumber includes air space around the physical board when calculating board feet in some situations, while the true measurement of ""board feet"" should be limited to the actual dimensions of the board.
For planed lumber, board feet refer to the nominal thickness and width of lumber, calculated in principle on its size before drying and planing. Here, the actual length is used.
Note: see dimensional lumber for a full discussion of the relationship of actual and nominal dimensions. Briefly, for softwoods, to convert nominal to actual, subtract 1⁄4 inch (6 mm) for dimensions under 2 inches; subtract 1⁄2 inch (13 mm) for dimensions over 2 inches and under 8 inches; and subtract 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) for larger measurements. The system is more complicated for hardwoods.

Yajnavalkya 95 Years Cycle,"Yajnavalkya's 95-year cycle is a method of harmonizing the lunar and solar calendars. It was proposed by the ancient Indian sage Yajnavalkya, who is believed to have lived around the 9th - 8th century BCE. He was described as the greatest Brahmajnyani by all the sages at the philosophical function organised by king Janaka. This cycle of reconciliation is also known as Yajnavalkya Cycle.
Yajnavalkya was Indian astronomer who studied about the motion of Sun and mentioned these theories in his work Shatapatha Brahmana. He invented a method of reconciliating the lunar calendar and the solar calendar. He described the 95-year cycle to synchronize the motions of the sun and the moon. It is mentioned as 95 year “Agnichayana” in the 6th Kānda of Shatapatha Brahmana.


== Description ==
The lunar calendar is based on the cycle of the Moon and consists of 12 months of 29.5 days each.  This means that the lunar calendar is about 11 days shorter than the solar calendar, which is based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
The Yajnavalkya 95-year cycle corrects this difference by adding an extra month (Adhik Maasa) to the lunar calendar every 32.5 years.  This means that there will be 71 lunar years and 70 solar years in a 95-year cycle.
There is a logic behind this cycle that if the year is counted as 360 Tithis, then this leads to exactly 35 intercalary months (with a residual small error) in 95 years.


== Metonic Cycle ==
Yajnavalkya 95-years cycle consisted of five sub cycles of 19 years. The sub cycle of 19 years is called as Metonic Cycle in the modern times. The cycle of 19 years had been derived from the cycle of 95 years.

Time value of money,"The time value of money refers to the fact that there is normally a greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference.
The time value of money refers to the observation that it is better to receive money sooner than later. Money you have today can be invested to earn a positive rate of return, producing more money tomorrow. Therefore, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.
The time value of money is among the factors considered when weighing the opportunity costs of spending rather than saving or investing money.  As such, it is among the reasons why interest is paid or earned: interest, whether it is on a bank deposit or debt, compensates the depositor or lender for the loss of their use of their money. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable net return on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset both the preference to spending money now and inflation (if present); see required rate of return.


== History ==
The Talmud (~500 CE) recognizes the time value of money. In Tractate Makkos page 3a the Talmud discusses a case where witnesses falsely claimed that the term of a loan was 30 days when it was actually 10 years. The false witnesses must pay the difference of the value of the loan ""in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) thirty days..., and that same sum in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) 10 years...The difference is the sum that the testimony of the (false) witnesses sought to have the borrower lose; therefore, it is the sum that they must pay.""
The notion was later described by Martín de Azpilcueta (1491–1586) of the School of Salamanca.


== Calculations ==
Time value of money problems involve the net value of cash flows at different points in time.
In a typical case, the variables might be: a balance (the real or nominal value of a debt or a financial asset in terms of monetary units), a periodic rate of interest, the number of periods, and a series of cash flows. (In the case of a debt, cash flows are payments against principal and interest; in the case of a financial asset, these are contributions to or withdrawals from the balance.)  More generally, the cash flows may not be periodic but may be specified individually. Any of these variables may be the independent variable (the sought-for answer) in a given problem. For example, one may know that: the interest is 0.5% per period (per month, say); the number of periods is 60 (months); the initial balance (of the debt, in this case) is 25,000 units; and the final balance is 0 units.  The unknown variable may be the monthly payment that the borrower must pay.
For example, £100 invested for one year, earning 5% interest, will be worth £105 after one year; therefore, £100 paid now and £105 paid exactly one year later both have the same value to a recipient who expects 5% interest assuming that inflation would be zero percent. That is, £100 invested for one year at 5% interest has a future value of £105 under the assumption that inflation would be zero percent.
This principle allows for the valuation of a likely stream of income in the future, in such a way that annual incomes are discounted and then added together, thus providing a lump-sum ""present value"" of the entire income stream; all of the standard calculations for time value of money derive from the most basic algebraic expression for the present value of a future sum, ""discounted"" to the present by an amount equal to the time value of money. For example, the future value sum 
  
    
      
        F
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle FV}

    {\displaystyle PV}

              +
              r
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV={\frac {FV}{(1+r)}}}
  

Some standard calculations based on the time value of money are:

Present value: The current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows, given a specified rate of return. Future cash flows are ""discounted"" at the discount rate; the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the future cash flows. Determining the appropriate discount rate is the key to valuing future cash flows properly, whether they be earnings or obligations.
Present value of an annuity: An annuity is a series of equal payments or receipts that occur at evenly spaced intervals. Leases and rental payments are examples.  The payments or receipts occur at the end of each period for an ordinary annuity while they occur at the beginning of each period for an annuity due.
Present value of a perpetuity is an infinite and constant stream of identical cash flows.
Future value: The value of an asset or cash at a specified date in the future, based on the value of that asset in the present.
Future value of an annuity (FVA): The future value of a stream of payments (annuity), assuming the payments are invested at a given rate of interest.
There are several basic equations that represent the equalities listed above. The solutions may be found using (in most cases) the formulas, a financial calculator or a spreadsheet. The formulas are programmed into most financial calculators and several spreadsheet functions (such as PV, FV, RATE, NPER, and PMT).
For any of the equations below, the formula may also be rearranged to determine one of the other unknowns. In the case of the standard annuity formula, there is no closed-form algebraic solution for the interest rate (although financial calculators and spreadsheet programs can readily determine solutions through rapid trial and error algorithms).
These equations are frequently combined for particular uses. For example, bonds can be readily priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum return of capital at the end of the bond's maturity—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine the present value of the bond.
An important note is that the interest rate i is the interest rate for the relevant period. For an annuity that makes one payment per year, i will be the annual interest rate. For an income or payment stream with a different payment schedule, the interest rate must be converted into the relevant periodic interest rate. For example, a monthly rate for a mortgage with monthly payments requires that the interest rate be divided by 12 (see the example below). See compound interest for details on converting between different periodic interest rates.
The rate of return in the calculations can be either the variable solved for, or a predefined variable that measures a discount rate, interest, inflation, rate of return, cost of equity, cost of debt or any number of other analogous concepts. The choice of the appropriate rate is critical to the exercise, and the use of an incorrect discount rate will make the results meaningless.
For calculations involving annuities, it must be decided whether the payments are made at the end of each period (known as an ordinary annuity), or at the beginning of each period (known as an annuity due). When using a financial calculator or a spreadsheet, it can usually be set for either calculation. The following formulas are for an ordinary annuity. For the answer for the present value of an annuity due, the PV of an ordinary annuity 
can be multiplied by (1 + i).


== Formula ==
The following formula use these common variables:

PV is the value at time zero (present value)
FV is the value at time n (future value)
A is the value of the individual payments in each compounding period
n is the number of periods (not necessarily an integer)
i is the interest rate at which the amount compounds each period
g is the growing rate of payments over each time period


=== Future value of a present sum ===
The future value  (FV)  formula is similar and uses the same variables.

  
    
      
        F
        V
         
        =
         
        P
        V
        ⋅
        (
        1
        +
        i
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle FV\ =\ PV\cdot (1+i)^{n}}
  


=== Present value of a future sum ===
The present value formula is the core formula for the time value of money; each of the other formulas is derived from this formula. For example, the annuity formula is the sum of a series of present value calculations.
The present value (PV) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:

  
    
      
        P
        V
         
        =
         
        
          
            
              F
              V
            
            
              (
              1
              +
              i
              
                )
                
                  n
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV\ =\ {\frac {FV}{(1+i)^{n}}}}
  

The cumulative present value of future cash flows can be calculated by summing the contributions of FVt, the value of cash flow at time t:

  
    
      
        P
        V
         
        =
         
        
          ∑
          
            t
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            
              F
              
                V
                
                  t
                
              
            
            
              (
              1
              +
              i
              
                )
                
                  t
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV\ =\ \sum _{t=1}^{n}{\frac {FV_{t}}{(1+i)^{t}}}}
  

Note that this series can be summed for a given value of n, or when n is ∞. This is a very general formula, which leads to several important special cases given below.


=== Present value of an annuity for n payment periods ===
In this case the cash flow values remain the same throughout the n periods. The present value of an annuity (PVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:

  
    
      
        P
        V
        (
        A
        )
        
        =
        
        
          
            A
            i
          
        
        ⋅
        
          [
          
            1
            −
            
              
                1
                
                  
                    (
                    
                      1
                      +
                      i
                    
                    )
                  
                  
                    n
                  
                
              
            
          
          ]
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV(A)\,=\,{\frac {A}{i}}\cdot \left[{1-{\frac {1}{\left(1+i\right)^{n}}}}\right]}
  

To get the PV of an annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + i).


=== Present value of a growing annuity ===
In this case each cash flow grows by a factor of (1+g). Similar to the formula for an annuity, the present value of a growing annuity (PVGA) uses the same variables with the addition of g as the rate of growth of the annuity (A is the annuity payment in the first period). This is a calculation that is rarely provided for on financial calculators.
Where i ≠ g :

  
    
      
        P
        V
        (
        A
        )
        
        =
        
        
          
            A
            
              (
              i
              −
              g
              )
            
          
        
        
          [
          
            1
            −
            
              
                (
                
                  
                    
                      1
                      +
                      g
                    
                    
                      1
                      +
                      i
                    
                  
                
                )
              
              
                n
              
            
          
          ]
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV(A)\,=\,{A \over (i-g)}\left[1-\left({1+g \over 1+i}\right)^{n}\right]}
  

Where i = g :

  
    
      
        P
        V
        (
        A
        )
        
        =
        
        
          
            
              A
              ×
              n
            
            
              1
              +
              i
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV(A)\,=\,{A\times n \over 1+i}}
  

To get the PV of a growing annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + i).


=== Present value of a perpetuity ===
A perpetuity is payments of a set amount of money that occur on a routine basis and continue forever. When n → ∞, the PV of a perpetuity (a perpetual annuity) formula becomes a simple division.

  
    
      
        P
        V
        (
        P
        )
         
        =
         
        
          
            A
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV(P)\ =\ {A \over i}}
  


=== Present value of a growing perpetuity ===
When the perpetual annuity payment grows at a fixed rate (g, with g < i) the value is determined according to the following formula, obtained by setting n to infinity in the earlier formula for a growing perpetuity:

  
    
      
        P
        V
        (
        A
        )
        
        =
        
        
          
            A
            
              i
              −
              g
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV(A)\,=\,{A \over i-g}}
  

In practice, there are few securities with precise characteristics, and the application of this valuation approach is subject to various qualifications and modifications. Most importantly, it is rare to find a growing perpetual annuity with fixed rates of growth and true perpetual cash flow generation. Despite these qualifications, the general approach may be used in valuations of real estate, equities, and other assets.
This is the well known Gordon growth model used for stock valuation.


=== Future value of an annuity ===
The future value (after n periods) of an annuity (FVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:

  
    
      
        F
        V
        (
        A
        )
        
        =
        
        A
        ⋅
        
          
            
              
                
                  (
                  
                    1
                    +
                    i
                  
                  )
                
                
                  n
                
              
              −
              1
            
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle FV(A)\,=\,A\cdot {\frac {\left(1+i\right)^{n}-1}{i}}}
  

To get the FV of an annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + i).


=== Future value of a growing annuity ===
The future value (after n periods) of a growing annuity (FVA) formula has five variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:

    {\displaystyle FV(A)\,=\,A\cdot {\frac {\left(1+i\right)^{n}-\left(1+g\right)^{n}}{i-g}}}

    {\displaystyle FV(A)\,=\,A\cdot n(1+i)^{n-1}}
  


=== Formula table ===
The following table summarizes the different formulas commonly used in calculating the time value of money. These values are often displayed in tables where the interest rate and time are specified.

Notes:

A is a fixed payment amount, every period
G is the initial payment amount of an increasing payment amount, that starts at G and increases by G for each subsequent period.
D is the initial payment amount of an exponentially (geometrically) increasing payment amount, that starts at D and increases by a factor of (1+g) each subsequent period.


== Derivations ==


=== Annuity derivation ===
The formula for the present value of a regular stream of future payments (an annuity) is derived from a sum of the formula for future value of a single future payment, as below, where C is the payment amount and n the period.
A single payment C at future time m has the following future value at future time n:

  
    
      
        F
        V
         
        =
        C
        (
        1
        +
        i

            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle FV\ =C(1+i)^{n-m}}
  

Summing over all payments from time 1 to time n, then reversing t

Note that this is a geometric series, with the initial value being a = C, the multiplicative factor being 1 + i, with n terms. Applying the formula for geometric series, we get

Another simple and intuitive way to derive the future value of an annuity is to consider an endowment, whose interest is paid as the annuity, and whose principal remains constant. The principal of this hypothetical endowment can be computed as that whose interest equals the annuity payment amount:

  
    
      
        
          Principal
        
        ×
        i
        =
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{Principal}}\times i=C}
  

  
    
      
        
          Principal
        
        =
        
          
            C
            i
          
        
        +
        
          goal
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{Principal}}={\frac {C}{i}}+{\text{goal}}}
  

Note that no money enters or leaves the combined system of endowment principal + accumulated annuity payments, and thus the future value of this system can be computed simply via the future value formula:

  
    
      
        F
        V
        =
        P
        V
        (
        1
        +
        i
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle FV=PV(1+i)^{n}}
  

Initially, before any payments, the present value of the system is just the endowment principal, 
  
    
      
        P
        V
        =
        
          
            C
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PV={\frac {C}{i}}}
  
. At the end, the future value is the endowment principal (which is the same) plus the future value of the total annuity payments (
  
    
      
        F
        V
        =
        
          
            C
            i
          
        
        +
        F
        V
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle FV={\frac {C}{i}}+FVA}
  
). Plugging this back into the equation:

  
    
      
        
          
            C
            i

    {\displaystyle FVA={\frac {C}{i}}\left[\left(1+i\right)^{n}-1\right]}
  


=== Perpetuity derivation ===
Without showing the formal derivation here, the perpetuity formula is derived from the annuity formula. Specifically, the term:

  
    
      
        
          (
          
            1
            −
            
              
                1
                
                  (
                  1
                  +
                  i
                  
                    )
                    
                      n
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left({1-{1 \over {(1+i)^{n}}}}\right)}
  

can be seen to approach the value of 1 as n grows larger. At infinity, it is equal to 1, leaving 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {C \over i}}
  
 as the only term remaining.


== Continuous compounding ==
Rates are sometimes converted into the continuous compound interest rate equivalent because the continuous equivalent is more convenient (for example, more easily differentiated). Each of the formulas above may be restated in their continuous equivalents. For example, the present value at time 0 of a future payment at time t can be restated in the following way, where e is the base of the natural logarithm and r is the continuously compounded rate:

  
    
      
        
          PV
        
        =
        
          FV
        
        ⋅
        
          e
          
            −
            r
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{PV}}={\text{FV}}\cdot e^{-rt}}
  

This can be generalized to discount rates that vary over time: instead of a constant discount rate r, one uses a function of time r(t). In that case the discount factor, and thus the present value, of a cash flow at time T is given by the integral of the continuously compounded rate r(t):

  
    
      
        
          PV
        
        =
        
          FV
        
        ⋅
        exp
        ⁡
        
          (
          
            −
            
              ∫
              
                0
              
              
                T
              
            
            r
            (
            t
            )
            
            d
            t
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{PV}}={\text{FV}}\cdot \exp \left(-\int _{0}^{T}r(t)\,dt\right)}
  

Indeed, a key reason for using continuous compounding is to simplify the analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus. Further, for interest accrued and capitalized overnight (hence compounded daily), continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding. More sophisticated analysis includes the use of differential equations, as detailed below.

While time value of money can be understood without using the framework of differential equations, the added sophistication sheds additional light on time value, and provides a simple introduction before considering more complicated and less familiar situations. This exposition follows (Carr & Flesaker 2006, pp. 6–7).
The fundamental change that the differential equation perspective brings is that, rather than computing a number (the present value now), one computes a function (the present value now or at any point in future). This function may then be analyzed — how does its value change over time? — or compared with other functions.
Formally, the statement that ""value decreases over time"" is given by defining the linear differential operator

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}:=-\partial _{t}+r(t).}
  

This states that value decreases (−) over time (∂t) at the discount rate (r(t)). Applied to a function it yields:

Conservation and restoration of waterlogged wood,"The conservation and restoration of waterlogged wood is the process undertaken by conservator-restorers of caring for and maintaining waterlogged wooden artefacts to preserve their form, and the information they contain. It covers the processes that can be taken by conservators, archaeologists, and other museum professionals to conserve waterlogged wood. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of waterlogged wood, as well as the preventive conservation and interventive conservation measures that can be taken.


== History ==
Waterlogged wood is a wooden object that has been submerged or partially submerged in water and has affected the original intended purpose or look of the object. Waterlogged wood objects can also include wood found within moist soil from archaeological sites, underwater archaeology, maritime debris, or damaged wood objects. Conservation of waterlogged wood has changed throughout time. Due to the delicate structure of this organic material, conservators and museum professionals alike have struggled with finding a textbook method. An example of the conservation of wood and how it has changed over time can be illustrated by the conservation treatments of a Kefermarkt altar. The earliest attempt at wood conservation is recorded as late as 1852–1855, A. Stifter treated the Kefermarkt altar in Austria with table salt in an attempt to protect the wood against pests. In around 1916-1918 Councillor Bolle attempted to protect the wood altar from pests included brushing the wood with petroleum and hexachloroethane. Finally, in 1929 the use of hydrogen cyanide relieved the pest problem and preserve the woods longevity. From a conservation standpoint, waterlogged or not, wood has been difficult to preserve because it is an organic material.


=== About wood as a material ===

Wood is an organic material and decays under biological and chemical degradation when buried or submerged above water or soil. Wood, an organic material produced by plants, are chemically composed of: carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin and other components (aliphatic acids, alcohols, proteins and inorganic substances) in a smaller amount. The most important composition of the plant is the cellulose. The cellulose accounts for the majority of the cell, about 40% to 50% of the wood's total mass. Hemicellulose represents the second most important carbohydrate and accounts for 20% to 30% of the wood's cell. In cases of extreme wetness or dryness, wood can be preserved until the extreme environment is disrupted. Conservation of wooden waterlogged objects is dependent on the natural wood type and biological structure. Wood is separated into two categories, hardwoods and softwoods. The category the waterlogged wood falls into can determine the amount of porous absorption. Hardwoods are classified as angiosperms. Angiosperms are considered porous woods because of the vessel pores. Softwoods are gymnosperms and are considered non-porous because of the lack of vessel pores. The type of wood and the availability of vessel pores largely affect how conservators treat and preserve waterlogged wood. Waterlogged wood objects can be found in a range of excavations sites. For example, waterlogged wood is something an archaeologist might stumble upon during an excavation either from the wood being submerged or near water or being in moist soil over time. Wood especially survives in archaeological sites that are dark anaerobic environments where bacteria that would cause wood decay cannot live.  


== Agents of deterioration ==
There are several agents of deterioration that affect waterlogged wood, mostly due to its environment. The major threats to deterioration include physical forces, pests, incorrect temperature, incorrect relative humidity, and custodial neglect. Attempts at preventive conservation focus on creating a stable storage environment, documentation, and resources to provide the environmental settings that keep an object as stable as possible. The excavation of waterlogged wood removes it from its anaerobic environment, exposing the wood to oxygen which continues the wood's deterioration. An environment with incorrect relative humidity and temperature can encourage bacteria and fungi growth, which adds to the decay and can attract pests. While interventive conservation treatments must balance ""remov[ing] the waterlogging water (not the 'bound' water which is part of the wood structure itself) without causing shrinkage or cell wall collapse,"" preventive conservation tactics include keeping the waterlogged wood in its original state (in water or a solution), with routine maintenance, or reburial of the wood to recreate the anaerobic environment it was once preserved within.


=== Relative humidity and temperature ===
Inconsistent relative humidity and temperature provide the perfect environment for mold and fungi growth on waterlogged wood. Growth of mold or other bacteria requires immediate attention to control damage. Natural cellulosic materials are the best environment for mold spores to grow and mature. ""Mold is a microorganism that produces enzymes that convert the cellulose in fibers to soluble sugar that is metabolized as food. Proteins are generally less susceptible, but keratinophilic fungi will feed on, and damage, these fibers as well"". Similar to wood found in nature, mold and other feeding organisms are attracted to the material, this includes pests and naturally occurring fungi and bacteria. Mold is a high risk for waterlogged wood even with controlled relative humidity and temperature due to the resilient nature of the organisms and the perfect environment waterlogged wood provides as a food source to the growth of spores.


=== Pests ===

Within maritime environments one of the largest pest threats to waterlogged wood includes shipworms (Teredinidae). Shipworms bore into wood that is immersed in seawater. Within a museum exhibit or storage environment and post treatment of waterlogged wood objects, there are a number of wood-boring pests that feast on wood. Two of which include the wood-boring/powderpost beetle and termites. Wood-boring beetles can include several different types within the board category. Each type of beetle could target a different type of wood. Evidence of pest deterioration includes powder-like frass near entry and exit holes within the wood. Termites also feast on and live below the surface of the wood so they can be more difficult to detect. Termites discharge six-sided fecal pellets and, if found on a wooden object, could be used to determine the type of pest damage


=== Physical ===
Physical deterioration of waterlogged wood can happen immediately through the evaporation of the water. If this happens rapidly, the cells in the wood can shrink and collapse. This damage might be inevitable depending on accessibility to treatment. Additionally waterlogged wood should never be handled extensively or put on exhibit for long periods of time. Most waterlogged wood is such that decayed wood cells in the material fill with water. Depending on the wood type and how long the wood has been in water, removal of the water from the cells too rapidly (in the form of natural drying or other) could apply major stress to the cell walls and cause them to collapse. Improperly dried waterlogged irreversibly shrinks, warps, cracks and there is risk of loss to the original surface.  


== Preventative conservation ==


=== Environment and Storage ===
Waterlogged wood should be in the environment that it is found in (and kept wet) until a stable treatment proposal in conversation with a professional conservator is decided. To limit mold growth, waterlogged wood should be stored with proper relative humidity and temperature that does not encourage mold.   Waterlogged wood will retain its structure as long as it is wet.


== Conservation treatment ==
The treatment of waterlogged wood should be undertaken by a professional conservator who understands how materials degrade and how the introduction of new materials might affect or at worst accelerate the degradation process. One of the largest issues with treatment on waterlogged wood is finding a way to remove the water in the wood but keep the water that is part of the material. Preventing cell wall collapse (which causes shrinking, cracking, and further damage) of the waterlogged wood while drying is the largest struggle and main goal of treatment. Some commonly-used treatments include the Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) method, Sucrose method, Acetone-Rosin method, alcohol-Ether method, Camphor-Alcohol method, freeze drying, and silicone oil treatment, or various combinations.   


=== Evaporation/displacement/replacement of heavily waterlogged wood ===


==== PEG Treatment ====
The purpose of the polyethylene glycol is to remove water from the wood while simultaneously bulking the deteriorated wood cells. PEG is applied to the surface, either by spraying or immersing the object in a solution of PEG in water. Over the course of the treatment, PEG is slowly increased in concentration, pushing out the excess water, coating the interior walls of the wood cells with PEG, which, depending on the molecular weight selected, will provide support once the artifact is dried. PEG compounds with different molecular weights may be used depending on the wood type, level of deterioration, and scope of project. 
The PEG treatment is often paired with vacuum freeze-drying, as the eutectic point of most PEG solutions is below the freezing point of water. This allows the ""free"" waterlogging water to sublimate in the process of freeze-drying, which minimizes damage to the wood by preventing ice from forming within the cells and expanding, causing more shrinking and warping. Some artifacts are too large to fit in a commercially available freeze-drier (see the treatment for Vasa or Mary Rose or the Bremen cog).


==== Sucrose Treatment ====
Identical to PEG treatment process but sucrose is used instead of PEG solution. The cells of the wood are replaced by sucrose, rather than water. Originally recommended as a low-cost method for treating waterlogged wood, sucrose treatments are inconsistent in how much shrinkage they prevent, especially for severely degraded wood.


==== Acetone-Rosin Treatment ====
Acetone-Rosin Treatment is sometimes used on dense wood that cannot be penetrated by PEG. This would include softwoods that are nonporous. The goal of this treatment is to replace cells of wood with natural rosin. Rosin is a natural resin that is produced within some woods, for example pines naturally produce resin and are considered a softwood. As a volatile solvent treatment option, the impact on the health and safety on the workplace must be considered.


=== Dehydration ===


==== Alcohol-Ether Treatment ====
This treatment follows the similar treatment of the PEG solution but instead of replacing the cells with another solution, the cells are replaced with alcohol and when the alcohol evaporates the cell and overall object is dehydrated. As a volatile solvent treatment option, the impact on the health and safety on the workplace must be considered.


==== Camphor-Alcohol Treatment ====
Camphor treatment is similar to the Alcohol-Ether treatment but instead of a quick evaporation of the alcohol inside of the cells, the camphor alcohol slowly replaces cell walls with camphor which goes from a solid to a gas state over time, keeping walls of cells bulked. As a volatile solvent treatment option, the impact on the health and safety on the workplace must be considered.


=== Desalination ===
Treatment must also take into account the type of water the wood was found in. Waterlogged wood recovered from marine environments may contain high levels of salts, which must be removed from the waterlogged wood to prevent further damage on drying. This can be done by a desalination process. Desalination is often completed in bath changes using clean water. Sometimes disinfectants (fungicides or algaecides) are added to prevent the development of damaging organisms. However, the most commonly used and recommended because of its lesser toxicity is a mixture of boric acid and borax. The desalination process takes a long period of time and is necessary that the water is changed until the concentration of excreted of soluble salts reach its maximum.


== Notable Projects ==


=== Alexandria Ship Project ===
In January 2016, a mid-18th century ship was discovered on the waterfront of Alexandria, Virginia. Conservation efforts include keeping the wood submerged and wet since the wooden frame was waterlogged. The conservation of this ship is ongoing. When the waterlogged wooden frame was originally removed from the archaeological site, the timber frames were stored in fresh water vats until June 2017. The framed structure was then packaged and sent to the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University for conservation. Documentation and conservation included laser scanning, modeling, X-ray, and wood degradation analysis before the treatment using polyethylene glycol and vacuum freeze drying


=== Mary Rose ===

After finding the vessel Mary Rose objects and what was left of the ship were placed in a passive storage which slowed down the process of immediate deterioration removing the vessel from its extreme environment. In 1994, an elaborate three phased conservation treatment began on Mary Rose. From 1993 to 2003 was the first phase that consisted of the wood getting sprayed with low-molecular-weight PEG to replace the water in the cellular structure of the wood. The second phase from 2003 to 2010, raised the molecular-weight of the PEG solution with the purpose to strengthen the outer surface layers. The third phase in 2016, included controlled air drying.


=== Vasa ===

The Vasa is a Swedish 1628 ship found archaeologically and was very well preserved. Completely submerged for 333 years allowed for the wood to be completely waterlogged but pollution in the 20th century off of the city Stockholm was able to kill any microorganisms that would have feast on the wreck, like the shipworm. Vasa was sprayed with a PEG solution for 17 years followed by a period of drying which is ongoing.

Harmonia Macrocosmica,"The Harmonia Macrocosmica is a star atlas by Andreas Cellarius. It was published in 1660 by Johannes Janssonius. The first part of the atlas has copper plate prints showing the universe models of Claudius Ptolemy, Nicolaus Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. In the second part are star maps of the Christian constellations. The atlas also had plates supporting the views of the Catholic Church, so the book was not placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a list of publications the Catholic Church censored.

Urinary anti-infective agent,"Urinary anti-infective agent, also known as urinary antiseptic, is medication that can eliminate microorganisms causing urinary tract infection (UTI). UTI can be categorized into two primary types: cystitis, which refers to lower urinary tract or bladder infection, and pyelonephritis, which indicates upper urinary tract or kidney infection.
Escherichia coli (E. Coli) is the predominant microbial trigger of UTIs, accounting for 75% to 95% of reported cases. Other pathogens such as Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus can also cause UTIs.
The use of antimicrobial therapy to treat UTIs started in the 20th century. Nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), fosfomycin, and pivmecillinam are currently the first-line agents for empiric therapy of simple cystitis. On the other hand, the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy for pyelonephritis depends on the severity of illness, specific host factors, and the presence of resistant bacteria. Ceftriaxone is often considered for parenteral treatment, while oral or parenteral fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, are suitable alternatives for treating pyelonephritis.
Antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to the individual, considering factors like the severity of illness, specific host factors, and pathogen resistance in the local community.


== Types of urinary anti-infective agent ==
Urinary antiseptics are medications that target bacteria in the urinary tract. They can be divided into two groups: bactericidal agents, and bacteriostatic agents. These antiseptics help prevent infections by effectively eliminating UTI symptoms through their action on microorganisms.


=== Urinary bactericidal agents ===


==== Nitrofurantoin ====

Nitrofurantoin is regarded as the first-line agent for simple cystitis, with an efficacy rate ranging from 88% to 92%. It can also be a prophylactic agent to prevent long-term UTIs. This antibacterial medication is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Nitrofurantoin exhibits its bactericidal activity through various mechanisms, including inhibiting ribosomal translation, causing bacterial DNA damage and interfering with the citric acid cycle. However, the specific role of each mechanism remains to be further explored.
When nitrofurantoin is metabolized, it converts into a reactive intermediate that attacks bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. This medication is typically taken orally and has minimal systemic absorption, reducing potential side effects. Common adverse reactions associated with nitrofurantoin include brown urine discoloration, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, rash, and peripheral neuropathy.


==== Fosfomycin ====

Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid bactericidal agent. It is commonly used as the first-line treatment for acute simple cystitis, demonstrating a 91% cure rate. It is administered orally as a single dose; In more complicated UTIs, the dose is adjusted to be repeated every three days to achieve successful eradication.
The bactericidal effect of fosfomycin is attributed to its capability to inhibit bacterial wall synthesis by inactivating an enzyme called pyruvyl transferase, which is responsible for microbial cell wall synthesis. Fosfomycin acts against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Administration of fosfomycin may lead to side effects such as headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.


==== Beta-lactam antibiotics ====

Beta-lactam antibiotics are often considered as a second-line option for treating UTIs due to their lower effectiveness compared to other antibiotics and their potential adverse effects. Commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics for UTIs include cephalosporins and penicillin. By binding to penicillin-binding proteins through their beta-lactam rings, beta-lactam antibiotics disrupt the normal function of these proteins, inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately resulting in cell death.
Cephalosporins are a subclass of beta-lactam family with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. They are categorized into five generations. First and third-generation cephalosporins, like cefalexin and ceftriaxone, are more commonly used in clinical practice.  Common adverse effects associated with cephalosporins include hypersensitivity, rash, anaphylaxis, and seizures.
Penicillin is another widely used subclass that effectively targets various bacteria. However, it is not regarded as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cystitis because of the high prevalence of penicillin-resistant E. coli strains. Within the penicillin class, pivmecillinam is considered the first-line empiric treatment for acute cystitis due to its wide spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria and its specific efficacy in the urinary tract. It has consistently demonstrated a high cure rate of over 85% for UTIs and a low resistance rate among E. coli strains. Amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, which enhances the effectiveness of amoxicillin, is often used as an alternative for cystitis treatment when other options cannot be used.


==== Fluoroquinolones ====

Fluoroquinolones are a class of antimicrobial agents known for their high efficacy and broad spectrum activity against aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These potent antibiotics exert their bactericidal effects by selectively inhibiting the activity of type II DNA topoisomerases, which effectively halt the replication of bacterial DNA, leading to bacterial death.
Among the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are used more frequently for the treatment of UTIs. These agents are well-absorbed orally and achieve significant concentrations in urine and various tissues. However, fluoroquinolones administration carries risk of GI symptoms, confusion, hypersensitivity, tendinopathy, and neuropathy. Additionally, the extensive use of fluoroquinolones has contributed to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in some areas. As a result, fluoroquinolones are generally reserved for more serious UTIs or when there are no better anti urinary-infective agent options.


=== Bacterial static agent ===


==== Sulfonamide ====
Sulfonamide is a bacteriostatic agent that competitively inhibits the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. By acting as a substrate analog of para-aminobenzoic acid, sulfonamide inhibits folic acid production. TMP/SMX is a combination of two antibacterial agents that work synergistically to combat a wide range of urinary tract pathogens. TMP/SMX is commonly used due to its ability to achieve high concentrations in urinary tract tissues and urine. This antibiotic combination demonstrates notable efficacy in both the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections. Common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, rash,pruritus, and photosensitivity.


== Renal dysfunction ==
Kidney disease can affect drug elimination, absorption, and distribution in the body, leading to altered serum drug concentrations. This can increase the risk of drug toxicity or suboptimal therapeutic effects. As a result, dosage adjustments are necessary for patients who fail to achieve the desired therapeutic serum drug levels.


=== Management ===
The choice of urinary anti-infective agents for patients with renal dysfunction is generally similar to that for individuals with normal kidney function. However, in cases where the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases to less than 20 mL/min, drug dosages adjustment is necessary because achieving the desired therapeutic serum drug levels becomes challenging in such patients.


=== Medication safety ===
Some drugs need to be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction. The use of nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2 as drug accumulation can lead to increased side effects and impaired recovery of the urinary tract, increasing the risk of treatment failure. The use of TMP/SMX also raises concerns in patients with kidney disease. In patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, the urine concentrations of SMX may decrease to subtherapeutic levels. Therefore, in patients with low creatinine clearance, it is recommended to prescribe a reduced dosage of TMP alone.


== Pregnancy ==
Pregnant women with UTIs are at a higher risk of experiencing recurrent bacteriuria and developing pyelonephritis compared to non-pregnant individuals. Untreated UTIs during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight infants.


=== Management ===
Antimicrobial treatment should be adjusted for UTIs in pregnant women to avoid potential side effects brought to fetus. For acute cystitis and pyelonephritis in pregnant women, empiric antibiotic treatment is often initiated. Commonly used antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis include amoxicillin-clavulanate and fosfomycin, while parenteral beta-lactams are preferred for acute pyelonephritis. These options are chosen because they are considered safer in pregnancy and have a relatively broad spectrum of activity. Typically, an antimicrobial course of five to seven days is given. This duration is chosen to minimize fetal exposure to antimicrobials while ensuring optimal treatment outcomes.


=== Medication safety ===
The type of urinary anti-infective agents should be carefully chosen for pregnant women with UTIs due to the potential impact on fetal development. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and fosfomycin are safe options during pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin is typically avoided during the first trimester due to uncertain associations with congenital anomalies. TMP/SMX should also be avoided as it may be associated with impaired folate metabolism, which increases the risk of neural tube defects.  However, when all alternative antibiotics are contraindicated, nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX become the last resort at the expense of the fetus. Fluoroquinolones should be avoided during pregnancy as they are associated with bone and cartilage toxicity in developing fetuses.


== Pediatrics ==
Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients is a significant clinical issue, affecting approximately 7% of fevered infants and children. If left untreated, the infection can ascend from the bladder to the kidneys, resulting in acute pyelonephritis, which leads to hypertension, kidney scarring, and end-stage kidney disease.


=== Management ===
The choice of urinary anti-infective agents used in pediatric patients and the duration of therapy depend on the types of UTIs they are suffering from. It is important to note that the dosage of antibiotics used in children is typically weight-dependent. Generally, oral or parenteral cephalosporins are recommended as the first-line agent for children older than two months. Second-line therapy should be considered for patients who have poor response to first-line treatment. Alternative choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate, nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, and ciprofloxacin.
For the treatment of simple cystitis in children, a five-day oral course of cephalexin is the preferred choice. As for children with suspected pyelonephritis, a ten-day treatment regimen is recommended. In such cases, a third-generation cephalosporin, such as cefdinir, is suggested as an appropriate option. If second-line therapy is initiated in pediatric patients with suspected pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin should be the preferred option among the four alternatives. Nitrofurantoin may not be adequate in treating upper urinary tract infections, while TMP/SMX and amoxicillin-clavulanate should be used with caution due to the risk of kidney scarring in these patients.


=== Medication safety ===
The choice of urinary anti-infective agents in pediatric patients may differ from that in adults due to the potential harm they can cause to children. For example, the systemic use of fluoroquinolones is not appropriate in pediatric patients due to the potential risk of musculoskeletal toxicity.


== History ==
The discovery of antimicrobial agents contributed significantly to UTI management during the 20th century. Nitrofurantoin emerged as the first practical and safe urinary antimicrobial agent, but it was with limited spectrum of activity. Subsequently, in the 1970s, beta-lactam antibiotics and TMP/SMX became available for UTI therapy. Antimicrobial resistance was developed to these agents due to their widespread and extensive usage, which restricted their clinical efficacy in UTI management. Fluoroquinolones emerged during the 1980s and were recommended as an alternative when resistance to TMP/SMX reaches 10% or higher. The evolving landscape of drug resistance will continue to influence the development and application of antimicrobial agents in UTI therapy.

Plaquette,"A plaquette (French: [plakɛt]; ""small plaque"") is a small low relief sculpture in bronze or other materials. These were popular in the Italian Renaissance and later. They may be commemorative, but especially in the Renaissance and Mannerist periods were often made for purely decorative purposes, with often crowded scenes from religious, historical or mythological sources. Only one side is decorated, giving the main point of distinction with the artistic medal, where both sides are normally decorated. They can usually be held within a hand. At the smaller end they overlap with medals, and at the larger they begin to be called plaques.  They have always been closely related to the medal, and many awards today are in the form of plaquettes, but plaquettes were less restricted in their subject-matter than the medal, and allowed the artist more freedom.


== History ==
The form began in the 1440s in Italy, but spread across Europe in the next century, especially to France, Germany and the Low Countries. By about 1550 it had fallen from fashion in Italy, but French plaquettes were entering their best period, and there and in Germany they continued to be popular into the 17th century. The form continued to be made at a low level, with something of a revival from about 1850.
The word plaquette is a 19th-century invention by the French art historian Eugene Piot. Les Bronzes de la Renaissance. Les Plaquettes by Émile Molinier of 1886 was the first large study, and these two between them defined the form as it is understood today. To Renaissance Italians plaquettes were known, along with other similar types of objects, by a variety of somewhat vague terms such as piastra and medaglietti, rilievi, or modelli.


=== Italy ===

Plaquettes grew from two rather different Italian origins. In Rome in the 1440s and 1450s they began as a way of reproducing the designs of classical engraved gems, by taking a wax impression of them. The Venetian Pietro Barbo (1417–1471) became a cardinal when his uncle was elected Pope Eugenius IV in 1431. He became an enthusiastic pioneer of this form, maintaining a foundry in his new Palazzo Venezia, and perhaps participating in the casting himself. These plaquettes had the same small size and classical subject matter as the gems they replicated.
Around the same time north Italian artists began making plaquettes, often much larger and with religious subject matter. Padua, already an important centre of metalworking, is seen by many historians as the crucial location. Two significant works, neither typical of later examples, were the self-portrait head by Leon Battista Alberti, oval and 20 cm high, and a slightly larger circular Madonna and Child with putti by Donatello (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). This remained highly unusual in that the reverse is concave and repeats the design. Other larger religious reliefs by Donatello were copied or adapted in a smaller plaquette format by other artists, probably including his own workshop. These grew out of a wider context of small religious images that represented mass-produced versions for the middle classes of the larger and unique religious art made for the rich and for churches. Also in the 1440s Pisanello was establishing the genre of the double-sided portrait medal, followed by Matteo de' Pasti and others. By the later decades of the century medals and plaquettes were being produced in most of the north Italian artistic centres.
Significant later artists included Moderno (as he signed many of his works), who was very likely Galleazzo Mondella, a goldsmith from Verona recorded in Rome around 1500. Some 45 plaquettes are signed by or attributed to him (and hardly any medals), and a number of members of his workshop have been identified by their styles. Andrea Riccio, Giovanni Bernardi, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Valerio Belli, and Leone Leoni, are among the artists to whom a clear name can be attached. Many significant unidentified masters are given notnames by art historians, such as Moderno and Master IO.F.F., who often signed their works. Belli and Bernardi were the leaders in the luxury form of small intaglios engraved in rock crystal, and several of these were reproduced in plaquette form around 1520–40, some cast from wax impressions taken off the crystals. Riccio was also a sculptor of small bronzes, and his plaquettes tended to have a relatively high relief. He had a large workshop and many followers.

=== Germany ===
German production began in Nuremberg, around 1500, but by 1600 Augsburg was the main centre. German examples tended to draw their designs from prints, and were in turn frequently reused in other media, and perhaps more often produced primarily as models for other trades. The repeated reuse of moulds, and their distribution far from their place of making, are especially typical of south German plaquettes. Even fewer of the artists involved are known than in Italy. Production lasted well into the 17th century, when it became involved in the ""Dürer revival"", with several of his prints being turned into plaquettes.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== France and the Netherlands ===
Further north plaquettes were produced from around 1550, initially under influence more from Germany than Italy. Artists (often Huguenot in France) included Étienne Delaune, who mostly lived in Strasbourg, and François Briot from Lorraine. François Duquesnoy from Brussels worked as a sculptor in Rome from 1618, and influenced Flemish plaquettes.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Later history ===

The form saw a small revival in the 19th century; examples from this period are typically rather larger than in the Renaissance. Artists such as, in America, Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Emil Fuchs made commemorative portrait plaquettes of figures such as Leo Tolstoy and Mark Twain (both by Saint-Gaudens). 
Especially in France and Germany, commemorative plaquettes for industry and institutions involved a wide range of contemporary subject matter. A number of artists produced examples purely because they were attracted by the form, or the possibility of reaching a wider market. A number of regular awards by institutions chose the plaquette form, though often retaining ""medal"" in the name of the award. The circular so-called ""death penny"" (the Memorial Plaque) minted in the UK after World War I is a large twentieth-century commemorative example.


== Materials and technique ==

As with medals, Renaissance plaquettes were normally made using the lost wax technique of casting, and numbers of copies were presumably normally made, although many now only survive in a unique copy, and perhaps never had others. The quality of individual castings can vary considerably, and the time and locations of individual castings from the same mould my vary considerably. Some designs can be shown to have had different generations of casts made from casts. Most are in bronze, but silver and gold, in solid or plated and gilded forms, are also found, as well as other metals. Often plaquettes with copies in precious metal also exist in bronze copies.
In early 16th-century Nuremberg, which was the main German centre, plaquettes, like other metalwork types of objects, were often made in the relatively plebeian material of brass, even by top artists like the Vischer family and Peter Flötner. Lead was also used, especially in German castings intended as artisan's models rather than for collectors. 
From the 19th century onwards, cast iron was also used, especially in Germany. In Italy lead was also used for an initial trial cast. The castings were normally not worked much further with tools, beyond polishing and often giving an artificial patina.


== Description ==
Only one side is decorated, giving the main point of distinction with the artistic medal, where both sides are normally decorated. Most are rectangular or circular, but other shapes are found, as in the example illustrated. Typical sizes range from about two inches up to about seven across a side, or as the diameter, with the smaller end or middle of that range more common. They ""typically fit within the hand"", as Grove puts it. At the smaller end they overlap with medals, and at the larger they begin to be called plaques.


== Usage ==


=== Past ===
The purpose and use of decorative plaquettes was evidently varied and remains somewhat unclear; their creation and use is relatively poorly documented. Some were mounted in furniture, boxes or other objects such as lamps, and many examples have holes for hanging on walls, added later. Other copies have three or four holes, for holding in a setting. Religious subjects in a pair or set might be set into the doors of tabernacles, and many were used for paxes, sometimes after being given a frame. Some shapes were designed for particular roles such as decorating sword hilts, though perhaps not all copies made were used in this way. Others were framed for hanging, but many were probably just kept and displayed loose, perhaps propped up on a shelf or desk, or in drawers or boxes. Many images show signs of wear. Devotional images were probably often carried around in a pocket, a habit that became common with crucifixes in Florence after a plague in 1373. A large part of the market was probably other artists and craftsmen looking for models for other forms. Plaquette bindings are leather bookbindings that incorporate plaquette casts in gesso, often of designs that are also found in metal.

Plaquettes were also collected, and in particular 16th-century examples are often crowded with figures, making the scenes hard to read. They are best appreciated when held in the hand near a good light source, and were probably passed round when a collection was shown to fellow connoisseurs. The difficulty of reading the scenes, and an often obscure choice of subjects, suggest that a self-conscious display of classical learning was part of their appeal, for collectors and artists alike. They were one of the types of objects often found in the – normally male – environment of the studiolo and cabinet of curiosities, along with other small forms such as classical coins and engraved gems.
The artists who made them tended to be either sculptors in bronze, also making small figures and objects such as inkwells, or goldsmiths, who often practised in the related field of engraving. They were relatively cheap and transportable, and were soon disseminated widely across Europe, offering an opportunity for artists to display their virtuosity and sophistication, and promote themselves beyond their own city. The same factors, combined with their modern display behind glass, make them relatively little appreciated today. The moulds were also sometimes re-used at considerable distances from their time and place of creation, or new moulds were made from a plaquette. German 17th-century plaquettes were still being used as models for silverware in Regency London.
Plaquettes, like prints, played an important part in the diffusion of styles and trends in iconography, especially for classical subjects. Some drawings for plaquette designs survive; others copied prints, book illustrations and designs in other media, including classical engraved gems and sculpture. In Germany models in wood or limestone might be made. They were often made in sets, illustrating a story, or set of figures.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


=== Present ===
Many awards are in the form of plaquettes.
The Swedish Film Academy's Silver Plaquette was awarded to filmmakers in some years between 1968 and 1994. As of 2024 current examples include plaquettes as awards for archery, tennis, community, and singing.


== Collections ==

Many major museums have collections, which are not always given room in the gallery displays. The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., despite being essentially a collection of paintings, has what is recognised as the finest single collection, especially of Italian Renaissance work, which includes over 450 plaquettes, and is very well displayed on the ground floor.
The Washington collection of medals, plaquettes and small bronzes includes the leading French collection assembled by Gustave Dreyfus (1837–1914), which was bought by Samuel H. Kress (1863–1955). In 1945 the Kress Foundation added over 1,300 bronzes collected by the British art dealer Lord Duveen, and donated all its collection to the museum in 1957.  Joseph E. Widener had already given the museum a significant collection in 1942.
The Wallace Collection in London has a good smaller display, as do the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Cabinet des médailles, Paris, the Hermitage Museum, the Ashmolean in Oxford, and a number of German museums, although the outstanding Berlin collection was lost in World War II. Not much of the British Museum's important collection is on display, nor that of the Vatican Museums.
The Bargello in Florence has some 400 plaquettes, about half from the collection of the Medici family, who played an important role in the development of the form. Most of the rest are from the collection of Louis Carrand, who bequeathed it to Florence. After that of Drefus, this is the next most important collection assembled in Paris in the 19th century and still intact. Paris was then the centre of plaquette collecting.

Feedback,"Feedback is a connection, a loop, between the cause and effect of a process. 


== Electronic ==
Sometimes, output from an electronic source affects future input.  This can form what is called a ""feedback loop"". In some cases the output reinforces the input, making it stronger; this is called ""self-reinforcing"", ""positive"", ""runaway"" or ""amplifying"". In other cases, the output blocks or stops some of the input; this is called a negative feedback loop.


=== Positive feedback ===
Think about a sound system with input from a microphone and output to a loudspeaker. If the sound coming out of the loudspeaker is heard by the microphone, a loop is created, from speaker, to the microphone, through the cord, and back into the speaker.  The loop is made up of sound and the electrical energy that the microphone and loudspeaker use to create that sound.  If nothing stops the sound and electricity in the loop, it will travel faster and faster, which is why feedback starts out as a low hum and turns into a high squeal very quickly
This is an example of a positive feedback loop: the output reinforces the input; it makes the input stronger.


=== Negative feedback ===
Think about two mirrors that face each other.  The mirrors reflect each other infinitely, or forever, but in each reflection, the image in the mirror is slightly smaller than the image it reflects.  The images get smaller and smaller until they are no longer visible.  This is an example of a negative feedback loop: the output (the reflection) reduces the input; it makes the input smaller.


== The runaway global warming hypothesis ==
Warm temperature caused a glacier to melt. As the glacier melts, areas that were at one time covered by snow and ice are now water or land. Because snow and ice reflect heat but water and land absorb heat, this causes the glacier to melt faster as more snow and ice is melted. This type of positive feedback is an example of thermal runaway.


== Cybernetics ==
American mathematician Norbert Wiener made feedback loops more well known in 1948 in his book Cybernetics. Cybernetics is the study of feedback loops and their role in communication and control.",0
Theology,"Theology is the study of religious belief from a religious perspective, with a focus on the nature of divinity. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries. It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and to reveal themselves to humankind.
Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument (experiential, philosophical, ethnographic, historical, and others) to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend or promote any myriad of religious topics. As in philosophy of ethics and case law, arguments often assume the existence of previously resolved questions, and develop by making analogies from them to draw new inferences in new situations.
The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world.


== Etymology ==

The term ""theology"" derives from the Greek theologia (θεολογία), a combination of theos (Θεός, 'god') and logia (λογία, 'utterances, sayings, oracles')—the latter word relating to Greek logos (λόγος, 'word, discourse, account, reasoning'). The term would pass on to Latin as theologia, then French as théologie, eventually becoming the English theology.

Through several variants (e.g., theologie, teologye), the English theology had evolved into its current form by 1362. The sense that the word has in English depends in large part on the sense that the Latin and Greek equivalents had acquired in patristic and medieval Christian usage although the English term has now spread beyond Christian contexts.


=== Classical philosophy ===
Greek theologia (θεολογία) was used with the meaning 'discourse on God' around 380 BC by Plato in The Republic. Aristotle divided theoretical philosophy into mathematike, physike, and theologike, with the latter corresponding roughly to metaphysics, which, for Aristotle, included discourse on the nature of the divine.
Drawing on Greek Stoic sources, the Latin writer Varro distinguished three forms of such discourse:

mythical, concerning the myths of the Greek gods;
rational, philosophical analysis of the gods and of cosmology; and
civil, concerning the rites and duties of public religious observance.


=== Later usage ===
Some Latin Christian authors, such as Tertullian and Augustine, followed Varro's threefold usage. However, Augustine also defined theologia as ""reasoning or discussion concerning the Deity"".
The Latin author Boethius, writing in the early 6th century, used theologia to denote a subdivision of philosophy as a subject of academic study, dealing with the motionless, incorporeal reality; as opposed to physica, which deals with corporeal, moving realities. Boethius' definition influenced medieval Latin usage.
In patristic Greek Christian sources, theologia could refer narrowly to devout and/or inspired knowledge of and teaching about the essential nature of God.
In scholastic Latin sources, the term came to denote the rational study of the doctrines of the Christian religion, or (more precisely) the academic discipline that investigated the coherence and implications of the language and claims of the Bible and of the theological tradition (the latter often as represented in Peter Lombard's Sentences, a book of extracts from the Church Fathers).
In the Renaissance, especially with Florentine Platonist apologists of Dante's poetics, the distinction between 'poetic theology' (theologia poetica) and 'revealed' or Biblical theology serves as stepping stone for a revival of philosophy as independent of theological authority.
It is in the last sense, theology as an academic discipline involving rational study of Christian teaching, that the term passed into English in the 14th century, although it could also be used in the narrower sense found in Boethius and the Greek patristic authors, to mean rational study of the essential nature of God, a discourse now sometimes called theology proper.
From the 17th century onwards, the term theology began to be used to refer to the study of religious ideas and teachings that are not specifically Christian or correlated with Christianity (e.g., in the term natural theology, which denoted theology based on reasoning from natural facts independent of specifically Christian revelation) or that are specific to another religion (such as below).
Theology can also be used in a derived sense to mean ""a system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid) ideology"".


== In religion ==
The term theology has been deemed by some as only appropriate to the study of religions that worship a supposed deity (a theos), i.e. more widely than monotheism; and presuppose a belief in the ability to speak and reason about this deity (in logia). They suggest the term is less appropriate in religious contexts that are organized differently (i.e., religions without a single deity, or that deny that such subjects can be studied logically). Hierology has been proposed, by such people as Eugène Goblet d'Alviella (1908), as an alternative, more generic term.


=== Abrahamic religions ===


==== Christianity ====

As defined by Thomas Aquinas, theology is constituted by a triple aspect: what is taught by God, teaches of God, and leads to God (Latin: Theologia a Deo docetur, Deum docet, et ad Deum ducit). This indicates the three distinct areas of God as theophanic revelation, the systematic study of the nature of divine and, more generally, of religious belief, and the spiritual path. Christian theology as the study of Christian belief and practice concentrates primarily upon the texts of the Old Testament and the New Testament as well as on Christian tradition. Christian theologians use biblical exegesis, rational analysis and argument. Theology might be undertaken to help the theologian better understand Christian tenets, to make comparisons between Christianity and other traditions, to defend Christianity against objections and criticism, to facilitate reforms in the Christian church, to assist in the propagation of Christianity, to draw on the resources of the Christian tradition to address some present situation or need, or for a variety of other reasons.


==== Islam ====

Islamic theological discussion that parallels Christian theological discussion is called Kalam; the Islamic analogue of Christian theological discussion would more properly be the investigation and elaboration of Sharia or Fiqh.

Kalam...does not hold the leading place in Muslim thought that theology does in Christianity. To find an equivalent for 'theology' in the Christian sense it is necessary to have recourse to several disciplines, and to the usul al-fiqh as much as to kalam.
Some Universities in Germany established departments of islamic theology. (i.e.)


==== Judaism ====

In Jewish theology, the historical absence of political authority has meant that most theological reflection has happened within the context of the Jewish community and synagogue, including through rabbinical discussion of Jewish law and Midrash (rabbinic biblical commentaries). Jewish theology is also linked to ethics, as it is the case with theology in other religions, and therefore has implications for how one behaves.


=== Indian religions ===


==== Buddhism ====

Some academic inquiries within Buddhism, dedicated to the investigation of a Buddhist understanding of the world, prefer the designation Buddhist philosophy to the term Buddhist theology, since Buddhism lacks the same conception of a theos or a Creator God. Jose Ignacio Cabezon, who argues that the use of theology is in fact appropriate, can only do so, he says, because ""I take theology not to be restricted to discourse on God.... I take 'theology' not to be restricted to its etymological meaning. In that latter sense, Buddhism is of course atheological, rejecting as it does the notion of God."" 
Whatever the case, there are various Buddhist theories and discussions on the nature of Buddhahood and the ultimate reality / highest form of divinity, which has been termed ""buddhology"" by some scholars like Louis de La Vallée-Poussin. This is a different usage of the term than when it is taken to mean the academic study of Buddhism, and here would refer to the study of the nature of what a Buddha is. In Mahayana Buddhism, a central concept in its buddhology is the doctrine of the three Buddha bodies (Sanskrit: Trikāya). This doctrine is shared by all Mahayana Buddhist traditions.  


==== Hinduism ====

Within Hindu philosophy, there are numerous traditions of philosophical speculation on the nature of the universe, of God (termed Brahman, Paramatma, Ishvara, and/or Bhagavan in some schools of Hindu thought) and of the ātman (soul). The Sanskrit word for the various schools of Hindu philosophy is darśana ('view, viewpoint'), the most influential one in terms of modern Hindu religion is Vedanta and its various sub-schools, each of which presents a different theory of Ishvara (the Supreme lord, God).
Vaishnava theology has been a subject of study for many devotees, philosophers and scholars in India for centuries. A large part of its study lies in classifying and organizing the manifestations of thousands of gods and their aspects. In recent decades the study of Hinduism has also been taken up by a number of academic institutions in Europe, such as the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies and Bhaktivedanta College. 
There are also other traditions of Hindu theology, including the various theologies of Shaivism (which include dualistic and non-dualistic strands) as well as the theologies of the Goddess centered Shakta traditions which posit a feminine deity as the ultimate.


=== Other religions ===


==== Shinto ====
In Japan, the term theology (神学, shingaku) has been ascribed to Shinto since the Edo period with the publication of Mano Tokitsuna's Kokon shingaku ruihen (古今神学類編, 'categorized compilation of ancient theology'). In modern times, other terms are used to denote studies in Shinto—as well as Buddhist—belief, such as kyōgaku (教学, 'doctrinal studies') and shūgaku (宗学, 'denominational studies').


==== Modern Paganism ====
English academic Graham Harvey has commented that Pagans ""rarely indulge in theology"". Nevertheless, theology has been applied in some sectors across contemporary Pagan communities, including Wicca, Heathenry, Druidry and Kemetism. As these religions have given precedence to orthopraxy, theological views often vary among adherents. The term is used by Christine Kraemer in her book Seeking The Mystery: An Introduction to Pagan Theologies and by Michael York in Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion.


== Topics ==
Richard Hooker defines theology as ""the science of things divine"". The term can, however, be used for a variety of disciplines or fields of study. Theology considers whether the divine exists in some form, such as in physical, supernatural, mental, or social realities, and what evidence for and about it may be found via personal spiritual experiences or historical records of such experiences as documented by others. The study of these assumptions is not part of theology proper, but is found in the philosophy of religion, and increasingly through the psychology of religion and neurotheology. Theology's aim, then, is to record, structure and understand these experiences and concepts; and to use them to derive normative prescriptions for how to live our lives.


== History of academic discipline ==

The history of the study of theology in institutions of higher education is as old as the history of such institutions themselves. For instance:

Taxila was an early centre of Vedic learning, possible from the 6th-century BC or earlier;: 140–142 
the Platonic Academy founded in Athens in the 4th-century BC seems to have included theological themes in its subject matter;
the Chinese Taixue delivered Confucian teaching from the 2nd century BC;
the School of Nisibis was a centre of Christian learning from the 4th century AD;
Nalanda in India was a site of Buddhist higher learning from at least the 5th or 6th century AD;: 149  and
the Moroccan University of Al-Karaouine was a centre of Islamic learning from the 10th century, as was Al-Azhar University in Cairo.
The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague,  Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or by municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt).
In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. Christian theological learning was, therefore, a component in these institutions, as was the study of church or canon law: universities played an important role in training people for ecclesiastical offices, in helping the church pursue the clarification and defence of its teaching, and in supporting the legal rights of the church over against secular rulers. At such universities, theological study was initially closely tied to the life of faith and of the church: it fed, and was fed by, practices of preaching, prayer and celebration of the Mass.
During the High Middle Ages, theology was the ultimate subject at universities, being named ""The Queen of the Sciences"". It served as the capstone to the Trivium and Quadrivium that young men were expected to study. This meant that the other subjects (including philosophy) existed primarily to help with theological thought.
In this context, medieval theology in the Christian West could subsume fields of study which would later become more self-sufficient, such as metaphysics (Aristotle's ""first philosophy"",
or ontology (the science of being).
Christian theology's preeminent place in the university started to come under challenge during the European Enlightenment, especially in Germany. Other subjects gained in independence and prestige, and questions were raised about the place of a discipline that seemed to involve a commitment to the authority of particular religious traditions in institutions that were increasingly understood to be devoted to independent reason.
Since the early 19th century, various different approaches have emerged in the West to theology as an academic discipline. Much of the debate concerning theology's place in the university or within a general higher education curriculum centres on whether theology's methods are appropriately theoretical and (broadly speaking) scientific or, on the other hand, whether theology requires a pre-commitment of faith by its practitioners, and whether such a commitment conflicts with academic freedom.


=== Ministerial training ===
In some contexts, theology has been held to belong in institutions of higher education primarily as a form of professional training for Christian ministry. This was the basis on which Friedrich Schleiermacher, a liberal theologian, argued for the inclusion of theology in the new University of Berlin in 1810.: ch. 14 
For instance, in Germany, theological faculties at state universities are typically tied to particular denominations, Protestant or Roman Catholic, and those faculties will offer denominationally-bound (konfessionsgebunden) degrees, and have denominationally bound public posts amongst their faculty; as well as contributing ""to the development and growth of Christian knowledge"" they ""provide the academic training for the future clergy and teachers of religious instruction at German schools.""
In the United States, several prominent colleges and universities were started in order to train Christian ministers. Harvard, Georgetown, Boston University, Yale, Duke University, and Princeton all had the theological training of clergy as a primary purpose at their foundation.
Seminaries and bible colleges have continued this alliance between the academic study of theology and training for Christian ministry. There are, for instance, numerous prominent examples in the United States, including Phoenix Seminary, Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, The Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Criswell College in Dallas, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, Dallas Theological Seminary, North Texas Collegiate Institute in Farmers Branch, Texas, and the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, Missouri. The only Judeo-Christian seminary for theology is the 'Idaho Messianic Bible Seminary' which is part of the Jewish University of Colorado in Denver.


=== As an academic discipline in its own right ===
In some contexts, scholars pursue theology as an academic discipline without formal affiliation to any particular church (though members of staff may well have affiliations to churches), and without focussing on ministerial training. This applies, for instance, to the Department of Theological Studies at Concordia University in Canada, and to many university departments in the United Kingdom, including the Faculty of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, the Department of Theology and Religion at the University of Exeter, and the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Leeds. Traditional academic prizes, such as the University of Aberdeen's Lumsden and Sachs Fellowship, tend to acknowledge performance in theology (or divinity as it is known at Aberdeen) and in religious studies.


=== Religious studies ===
In some contemporary contexts, a distinction is made between theology, which is seen as involving some level of commitment to the claims of the religious tradition being studied, and religious studies, which by contrast is normally seen as requiring that the question of the truth or falsehood of the religious traditions studied be kept outside its field. Religious studies involves the study of historical or contemporary practices or of those traditions' ideas using intellectual tools and frameworks that are not themselves specifically tied to any religious tradition and that are normally understood to be neutral or secular. In contexts where 'religious studies' in this sense is the focus, the primary forms of study are likely to include:

Anthropology of religion
Comparative religion
History of religions
Philosophy of religion
Psychology of religion
Sociology of religion
Sometimes, theology and religious studies are seen as being in tension, and at other times, they are held to coexist without serious tension.
Occasionally it is denied that there is as clear a boundary between them.


== Criticism ==


=== Pre-20th century ===
Whether or not reasoned discussion about the divine is possible has long been a point of contention. Protagoras, as early as the fifth century BC, who is reputed to have been exiled from Athens because of his agnosticism about the existence of the gods, said that ""Concerning the gods I cannot know either that they exist or that they do not exist, or what form they might have, for there is much to prevent one's knowing: the obscurity of the subject and the shortness of man's life.""

Since at least the eighteenth century, various authors have criticized the suitability of theology as an academic discipline. In 1772, Baron d'Holbach labeled theology ""a continual insult to human reason"" in Le Bon sens. Lord Bolingbroke, an English politician and political philosopher, wrote in Section IV of his Essays on Human Knowledge, ""Theology is in fault not religion. Theology is a science that may justly be compared to the Box of Pandora. Many good things lie uppermost in it; but many evil lie under them, and scatter plagues and desolation throughout the world.""

Thomas Paine, a Deistic American political theorist and pamphleteer, wrote in his three-part work The Age of Reason (1794, 1795, 1807):The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion. Not anything can be studied as a science, without our being in possession of the principles upon which it is founded; and as this is the case with Christian theology, it is therefore the study of nothing.The German atheist philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach sought to dissolve theology in his work Principles of the Philosophy of the Future: ""The task of the modern era was the realization and humanization of God – the transformation and dissolution of theology into anthropology."" This mirrored his earlier work The Essence of Christianity (1841), for which he was banned from teaching in Germany, in which he had said that theology was a ""web of contradictions and delusions"".
The American satirist Mark Twain remarked in his essay ""The Lowest Animal"", originally written in around 1896, but not published until after Twain's death in 1910, that:[Man] is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight. He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven.... The higher animals have no religion. And we are told that they are going to be left out in the Hereafter. I wonder why? It seems questionable taste.


=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
A. J. Ayer, a British former logical-positivist, sought to show in his essay ""Critique of Ethics and Theology"" that all statements about the divine are nonsensical and any divine-attribute is unprovable. He wrote: ""It is now generally admitted, at any rate by philosophers, that the existence of a being having the attributes which define the god of any non-animistic religion cannot be demonstratively proved.... [A]ll utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical.""

Jewish atheist philosopher Walter Kaufmann, in his essay ""Against Theology"", sought to differentiate theology from religion in general:Theology, of course, is not religion; and a great deal of religion is emphatically anti-theological.... An attack on theology, therefore, should not be taken as necessarily involving an attack on religion. Religion can be, and often has been, untheological or even anti-theological. However, Kaufmann found that ""Christianity is inescapably a theological religion.""
English atheist Charles Bradlaugh believed theology prevented human beings from achieving liberty, although he also noted that many theologians of his time held that, because modern scientific research sometimes contradicts sacred scriptures, the scriptures must therefore be wrong. Robert G. Ingersoll, an American agnostic lawyer, stated that, when theologians had power, the majority of people lived in hovels, while a privileged few had palaces and cathedrals. In Ingersoll's opinion, it was science that improved people's lives, not theology. Ingersoll further maintained that trained theologians reason no better than a person who assumes the devil must exist because pictures resemble the devil so exactly.

The British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has been an outspoken critic of theology. In an article published in The Independent in 1993, he severely criticizes theology as entirely useless, declaring that it has completely and repeatedly failed to answer any questions about the nature of reality or the human condition. He states, ""I have never heard any of them [i.e. theologians] ever say anything of the smallest use, anything that was not either platitudinously obvious or downright false."" He then states that, if all theology were completely eradicated from the earth, no one would notice or even care. He concludes:The achievements of theologians don't do anything, don't affect anything, don't achieve anything, don't even mean anything. What makes you think that 'theology' is a subject at all?

Welcome sign,"A welcome sign (or gateway sign) is a road sign at the border of a jurisdiction or region that introduces or welcomes visitors to the place.  Examples of welcome signs can be found near political borders, such as when entering a state, province, county, city, or town, and they are increasingly found in neighborhoods and private communities.  In European countries under the Schengen Agreement, a welcome sign may be found at borders between countries. Its purpose is partly informational, to inform drivers where they are, and partly for tourism, as it affords an opportunity to advertise features within the region to people who are entering it.  A welcome sign is a type of town sign—a sign placed at the entrance to and exit from a city, town, or village. In many jurisdictions, the format of town signs is standardized; in some, welcome signs may be distinct from the legally mandated town sign.
A municipality's welcome sign may give its population or date of foundation, list twinned towns or services within the town, or depict the town's crest, typical local products, or the logo of sponsor organizations which maintain the sign (such as the local Lions Club).

Transparent wood composite,"Transparent wood composites are novel wood materials which have up to 90% transparency. Some have better mechanical properties than wood itself. They were made for the first time in 1992. These materials are significantly more biodegradable than glass and plastics. Transparent wood is also shatterproof, making it suitable for applications like cell phone screens.


== History ==
A research group led by Professor Lars Berglund from Swedish KTH University along with a University of Maryland research group led by Professor Liangbing Hu have developed a method to remove the color and some chemicals from small blocks of wood, followed by adding polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and epoxy, at the cellular level, thereby rendering them transparent.
As soon as released in between 2015 and 2016, see-through wood had a large press reaction, with articles in ScienceDaily, Wired, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times.
Actually those research groups rediscovered a work from Siegfried Fink, a German Researcher, from as early as 1992: with a process very similar to Berglund's and Hu's, the German Researcher turned wood transparent to reveal specific cavities of the wood structure for analytical purpose.
In 2021 researchers reported a way to manufacture transparent wood lighter and stronger than glass that requires substantially smaller amounts of chemicals and energy than methods used before. The thin wood produced with ""solar-assisted chemical brushing"" is claimed to be lighter and about 50 times stronger than wood treated with previous processes.


== Process ==
In its natural state, wood is not a transparent material because of its scattering and absorption of light. The tannish color in wood is due to its chemical polymer composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The wood's lignin is mostly responsible for the wood's distinctive color. Consequently, the amount of lignin determines the levels of visibility in the wood, around 80–95%. To make wood a visible and transparent material, both absorption and scattering need to be reduced in its production. The manufacturing process of transparent wood is based on removing all of the lignin called the delignification process.


=== Delignification process ===
The production of transparent wood from the delignification process vary study by study. However, the basics behind it are as follows: a wood sample is drenched in heated (80 °C–100 °C) solutions containing sodium chloride, sodium hypochlorite, or sodium hydroxide/sulfite for about 3–12 hours followed by immersion in boiling hydrogen peroxide. Then, the lignin is separated from the cellulose and hemicellulose structure, turning the wood white and allowing the resin penetration to start. Finally, the sample is immersed in a matching resin, usually PMMA, under high temperatures (85 °C) and a vacuum for 12 hours. This process fills the space previously occupied by the lignin and the open wood cellular structure resulting in the final transparent wood composite.
While the delignification process is a successful method of production, it is limited to its laboratory and experimental production of a small, and low-thickness material that is unable to meet its practical application requirements. However, at Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources in 2018, Xuan Wang and his colleagues developed a new production method of infiltrating a prepolymerized methyl methacrylate (MMA) solution into delignified wood fibers. By utilizing this new technique, large-size transparent wood with any thickness or any measure can be easily made. Yet in spite of this success in the manufacture, challenges still exist with regard to mechanical stability and adjustable optical performance.


== Properties ==
Wood is a natural growth material that possesses excellent mechanical properties, including high strength, good durability, high moisture content, and high specific gravity. Wood can be classified in two types of wood, softwood and hardwood. While each type is different—e.g., the longitudinal cells in softwood are shorter in length when compared to hardwood—both types have a similar hierarchical structure, meaning the orientation of the cells is identical in the wood. This unique anisotropic structure, the properties with distinctive values when measured in several directions, allows it to pump ions and water for photosynthesis in the wood. Similarly, in transparent wood composites, removing the lignin and maintaining the cellulose fiber tubes it allows it to become a clear wood that can get soaked in a glue-like epoxy that makes it a robust and transparent material. An excellent raw material with high transmittance and enhanced mechanical properties.
Researchers have successfully tested an eco-friendly alternative: limonene acrylate, a monomer made from limonene, into an acrylate. Limonene is a common cyclic terpene that can be extracted from industrial waste, via isomerization of α‐pinene (from wood) or from citrus peel oil. The bio-based polymers can offer advantages compared to conventional non‐renewable polymers from fossil resources, and still retain a high mechanical performance and it is lightweight, stemming from its porous and anisotropic cellulosic structure; and is of great interest for large-scale sustainable nanotechnologies. Succinylation of the delignified wood substrate using succinic anhydride results in a nanostructured and mechanically strong biocomposite. The polymer matrix usually accounts for ≈70 vol%, results in nanostructured biocomposites combining an excellent optical transmittance of 90% at 1.2 mm thickness and a remarkably low haze of 30%, with a high mechanical performance (strength 174 MPa, Young's modulus 17 GPa). 


=== Mechanical properties ===
Transparent wood derives its mechanical properties and performance primarily from its cellulose fiber content and the geometric orientation of the fiber tube cells (radial and tangential) structure, providing the structural base for the design of advanced materials applications.
One aspect of the transparent wood mechanical property is the strength of the material. According to Zhu and his colleagues, transparent wood in the longitudinal direction has an elastic modulus of 2.37 GPa and strength of 45.38 MPa (both which are lower than for pure PMMA) and twice as high as those perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, 1.22 GPa and 23.38 MPa respectively. They conclude that longitudinal to transverse properties decreased for transparent wood, which they expected as the presence of the polymer resin suppresses the cavity space. Also, the plastic nature of transparent wood composite provides advantages compare to other brittle materials like glass, meaning it does not shatter upon impact.


=== Optical transmittance and thermal conductivity ===
The transparent wood, tightly packed and perpendicularly aligned cellulose fibers operate as wideband wave-guides with high transmission scattering losses for light. This unique light management capacity results in a light propagation effect. By measuring its optical properties with an integrated sphere, Li and her colleagues found that transparent wood exhibits a high transmittance of 90% (lower than for pure PMMA) and a high optical haze of 95%. As a result, transparent wood as an energy efficient material could be used to decrease the daytime lighting energy usage by efficiently guiding the sunlight into the house while providing uniform and consistent illumination throughout the day.
Similarly, the transparent wood's thermal conductivity is attributed to the alignment of the wood cellulose fibers, which has been preserved after lignin removal and polymer infiltration. Transparent wood has a thermal conductivity of 0.32 W⋅m−1⋅K−1 in the axial direction and 0.15 W⋅m−1⋅K−1 in the radial direction respectably. Based on the study done by Céline Montanari of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, the transparent wood's thermal conductivity, which transforms from semi-transparent to transparent when heated, could be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by capturing the sun's energy during the day and releasing it later at night into the interior.


== Future application ==
Although the development of transparent wood composites is still at a lab-scale and prototype level, their potential for energy efficiency and operational savings in the building industry are very promising. An essential advantage with transparent wood is its combination of structural and functional performance for load-bearing structures that combine optical, heat-shielding, or magnetic functionalities. Transparent wood is also researched for potential use for touch-sensitive surfaces.


=== Glazing system ===
Such is the case in building applications where artificial light can be replaced by sunlight through a light transmittance design. Based on research and simulation performed by Joseph Arehart at the University of Colorado Boulder, transparent wood as a glass glazing system replacement could reduce the space conditioning energy consumption by 24.6% to 33.3% in medium (climate zone 3C, San Francisco, CA) and large office spaces (climate zone 4C, Seattle, Washington) respectably. These are relevant insights in transparent wood's potential functionality because it shows lower thermal conductivity and better impact strength compared to popular glass glazing systems.  


=== Solar cells ===
Another direction for transparent wood applications is as a high optical transmittance for optoelectronic devices as substrates in photovoltaic solar cells. Li and her colleagues at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology studied the high optical transmittance that makes transparent wood a candidate for substrate in perovskite solar cells. They concluded that transparent wood has high optical transmittance of 86% and long term stability with fracture of toughness 3.2 MPa⋅m1/2 compared to glass substrate fracture of toughness 0.7–0.85 MPa⋅m1/2, which meets the substrate's requirements for solar cells. These are relevant information for transparent wood's possible application because it is a suitable and sustainable solution to the substrate for solar cell assembly with potential in energy-efficient building applications, as well as replacements for glass and lowering the carbon footprint for the devices.
Transparent wood could transform the material sciences and building industries by enabling new applications such as load-bearing windows. These components could also generate improvements in energy savings and efficiency over glass or other traditional materials. A lot of work and research is needed to understand the interaction between light and the wood structure further, to tune the optical and mechanical properties, and to take advantage of advanced transparent wood composite applications

Tourist tax,"A tourist tax is any revenue-generating measure targeted at tourists. It is a means of combating overtourism and a form of tax exporting (partial shifting of tax burden to non-citizens or non-residents). The tourist industry typically campaigns against the taxes. It is separate from value-added tax and other taxes that tourists may pay, but are also paid by residents.


== Types ==


=== Per diem tax ===
As of 2019, Bhutan charges $200 to $250 per visitor per day, considered one of the highest tourist taxes at the time. Originally people from India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives were exempt from part of the fee, but the country plans to increase fees for these visitors beginning in 2020.


=== Hotel tax ===

Many countries in Europe charge a per-day tax on rooms in hotels and other temporary accommodation. In Germany, the tax is levied by cities in addition to VAT and is called Kulturförderabgabe (lit. 'culture promotion tax') or ""Bettensteuer"" (bed tax). In many municipalities business travelers are exempt from paying it. Spanish municipalities also charge local hotel tax of a few euros flat fee. In Greece the hotel tax, charged from 2018, ranges from 0.50 euros to 4 euros. Romania, in addition to other tourist taxes, charges 1% of the price of the accommodation nationally. Many US states and municipalities charge hotel tax. The highest rate is Houston at 17% of the cost of lodging daily.
In the Netherlands, cruising tax is also charged for people staying in cruise ships docked in the city, while separate taxes target people staying in hotels.


=== Restaurant tax ===
Taxes on restaurants can also be considered a form of tourist tax.


=== Arrival tax ===
In 2019, New Zealand was planning to institute a $35 arrival tax for visitors from countries beyond the Pacific region. It was estimated to raise NZ$80 million annually and reduce the number of visitors by 20,000 annually. Venice planned a 10-euro entrance fee in 2018 which was delayed during the COVID pandemic, and Civita di Bagnoregio charges a 5-euro entry fee as of 2019.


=== Departure tax ===

Most Caribbean countries charge a departure tax (in 2019, it was $51 in Antigua and Barbuda, and $15 in Bahamas) which is automatically added to airline fares. As of 2019, Japan charged a 1,000-yen ""sayonara tax"" to visitors leaving the country. Proceeds were used to fund the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to be held in Tokyo. Indonesia charges a departure tax, but it differs depending on the airport.


== Tourist taxes and overtourism ==
Tourist taxes are increasingly being employed by destinations seeking to manage the overtourism crisis.
Venice – one of the most overtouristed cities in Europe - has announced that in 2024 it will be implementing a $5 entry fee from 8:30am to 4pm during peak weekends and other weekdays between April and mid-July.
The aim is to try to reduce crowds and to improve quality of life for the people living in Venice. The city says proceeds from the tax will go towards maintaining essential services for residents.
Other destinations introducing a tourism tax in 2024 to manage visitor numbers and support local infrastructure include:

Greece, which is introducing a ‘Climate Crisis Resilience Fee’ of between 1.50Euros to  10Euros dependent on the time of year, accommodation type, and quality.
Bali, which is introducing a one-time fee of 10USD per visitor to protect culture and nature from 14 February 2024.
Olhão, Portugal, which has become the third Portuguese borough to introduce a tourism tax. Visitors will need to pay 2Euros per night in the high season (between April and October) and €1 per night in low season (November to March), for a maximum of five nights.
Iceland, which reintroduced a tax suspended during the COVID pandemic.


== Public support for tourist taxes ==
In March 2023, in response to concerns over National Park funding cuts in the UK, ethical travel company Responsible Travel conducted a survey of 670 UK travellers to see if they would be willing to pay a levy to support nature conservation when visiting a National Park or Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Ninety percent of respondents confirmed they would be happy to pay between £2 and £10 per night if proceeds were ringfenced to support local conservation projects.

Spark (fire),"A spark is an incandescent particle.  Sparks may be produced by pyrotechnics, by metalworking or as a by-product of fires, especially when burning wood.


== Pyrotechnics ==

In pyrotechnics, charcoal, iron filings, aluminum, titanium and metal alloys such as magnalium may be used to create sparks. The quantity and style of sparks produced depends on the composition and pyrophoricity of the metal and can be used to identify the type of metal by spark testing.  In the case of iron, the presence of carbon is required, as in carbon steel — about 0.7% is best for large sparks. The carbon burns explosively in the hot iron and this produces pretty, branching sparks. The color of sparks used in pyrotechnics is determined by the material that the sparks are made from, with the possibility of adding different chemical compounds to certain materials to further influence the color of the sparks. The basic color of sparks is limited to red/orange, gold (yellow) and silver (white). This is explained by light emission from a solid particle. Light emitted from solid particles is defined by black-body radiation. The temperature of the spark is controlled by the reactivity of the metal. Higher reactive metals lead to hotter sparks. The electronegativity has found to be a helpful indicator to estimate the temperature and consequently the color of a spark. To achieve colors differing from black body emitters, vapor phase combustion of the metal is necessary. A typical example is zinc, with a low boiling of 1180 K. Zinc sparks show an unusual  bluish/greenish white appearance. Exotic sparks can be obtained from erbium powder. These sparks switch between surface and vapor phase combustion and accordingly between orange (black body) and green (element specific) emission. The color-change is based on the medium-ranged boiling point of erbium, which burns only partly in the vapor phase.  The adjacent rare earth elements thulium, lutetium and yttrium can form color-changing sparks, too, although the visibility of both phases of the same spark is less pronounced due to a lower (Tm) or higher (Y, Lu) boiling point of the metal. Alloys containing at least one metal with a low boiling point can be used to control the color of the spark. The lower boiling component evaporates and burns in the vapor phase, while the metal with a high boiling point serves as a carrier. In the vapor phase, bright element-specific light emission takes place. For example, a eutectic ytterbium-copper-alloy forms long green sparks and burning lithium silicide shows long red spark segments. The duration of a spark’s existence is determined by the initial size of the particle, with a larger size leading to a longer-lasting spark.
Metals with low thermal conductivity are especially good at producing sparks. Titanium and zirconium are especially good in this respect and so are now used in fireworks. Copper, on the other hand, has a high conductivity and so is poor at producing sparks. For this reason, alloys of copper such as beryllium bronze are used to make safety tools which will not spark so easily.


== Flint and steel ==

Robert Hooke studied the sparks created by striking a piece of flint and steel together. He found that the sparks were usually particles of the steel that had become red hot and so melted into globules. These sparks can be used to ignite tinder and so start a fire.
In colonial America, flint and steel were used to light fires when easier methods failed. Scorched linen was commonly used as tinder to catch the spark and start the fire, but producing a good spark could take much time. A spinning steel wheel provided a good stream of sparks when it engaged the flint, and a tinderbox designed to do this was known as a mill.
In a modern lighter or firesteel, iron is mixed with cerium and other rare earths to form the alloy ferrocerium. This readily produces sparks when scraped and burns hotter than steel would. This higher temperature is needed to ignite the vapour of the lighter fluid.


== Metal working ==

Molten metal sparks can be created when metal is heated by processes such as Bessemer conversion of iron to steel or arc welding.

Arc welding uses a low voltage and high current electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt the metals at the welding point, which often creates sparks. To reduce the risk of burns, welders wear heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat, flames, and sparks. In spot welding, metal surfaces that are held in contact are joined by the heat from resistance to electric current flow. It is common for a spray of sparks in the form of molten metal droplets to be ejected from the parts being joined. or the resistance heating of spot welding.


== Fires and spark arrestors ==

Fires may produce sparks as updrafts carry particles of the burning fuel aloft. This was a great problem with steam locomotives as the sparks might set fire to the adjacent landscape or even to the train itself, especially if the engine burned wood rather than coal. To prevent this dangerous nuisance, a variety of spark arrestors were invented and fitted.
The chimneys and exhausts of other fuel-burning engines such as steam engines or internal combustion engines might also have spark arrestors fitted if there would be a fire risk from their operation.  For example, a trail bike might be fitted with a centrifugal arrestor, which will trap glowing hot pieces of soot.


== Symbolism ==

The significance of a spark as a source for a flame or a conflagration shows clearly, for example, in the naming and motto of  Lenin's newspaper Iskra [The Spark]. The spark metaphor has often been used in philosophy since Stoicism and, recently, after Jacques Lacan. The “creative spark” has come to be considered as inherent to metaphor itself. Hasidic philosophy contains a doctrine of holy sparks (nitzotzot) from the kabbalism of Isaac Luria in which there is a duty to gather the sundered light of creation.
In the Book of Job (Job 5:7), it is written, ""Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.""  The use by King James' translators of the word sparks here is a poetic one rather than a literal one. The sparks of fire are identified by some translators as the sons of Resheph - a Canaanite deity of lightning and pestilence.

Lower flammability limit,"The lower flammability limit (LFL), usually expressed in volume per cent, is the lower end of the concentration range over which a flammable mixture of gas or vapour in air can be ignited at a given temperature and pressure. The flammability range is delineated by the upper and lower flammability limits. Outside this range of air/vapor mixtures, the mixture cannot be ignited at that temperature and pressure. The LFL decreases with increasing temperature; thus, a mixture that is below its LFL at a given temperature may be ignitable if heated sufficiently.  
For liquids, the LFL is typically close to the saturated vapor concentration at the flash point, however, due to differences in the liquid properties, the relationship of LFL to flash point (which is also dependent on the test apparatus) is not fixed and some spread in the data usually exists.

Animation department,"Animation departments (or animation production departments) are the teams within a film studio that work on various aspects of animation such as storyboarding or 3D modeling. It can refer to a single department that handles animation as a whole or to multiple departments that handle specific tasks. It can also refer to a college department.


== Departments of animation ==
Retake department - looks for mistakes in animation and has it redone. An animator will check all frames one by one in order to ensure they flow smoothly.
Compositing department - handles special effects such as chroma keying and other aspects of compositing.
Inbetweening department - creates in-betweens, the frames that go between key frames (the main points of action in a scene) that make up the bulk of an animation.
Editing department - compiles and edits the animation (either in part or in its entirety) so that it is consistent.
Background department - draws the background art for scenes.
Storyboard department - plans out the animation using sketches of its main points (a storyboard).
Scanning department - converts traditionally-drawn media to digital and ensures frames aren't lost in the process.
Sound effects and musical scoring department - creates soundtracks and sound effects, such as with choirs, instruments, and Foley.
Layout department - stages scenes and creates plans for how a scene should look.

Gesamtkunstwerk,"Gesamtkunstwerk is a German word meaning ""total artwork"".
Richard Wagner used gesamtkunstwerk in creating his operas. In the Classical era, there was more emphasis on the music in an opera. But in the Romantic era, there was more of an emphasis on personal expression. Wagner made his operas into movie-like performances.",0
Outline of tourism,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to tourism:
Tourism – travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go ""beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only"", as people ""traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes"".

Fatwood,"Fatwood, also known as ""fat lighter"", ""lighter wood"", ""rich lighter"", ""pine knot"", ""lighter knot"", ""heart pine"", ""fat stick"" or ""lighter'd"" [sic], is derived from the heartwood of pine trees. The stump (and tap root) that is left in the ground after a tree has fallen or has been cut is the primary source of fatwood, as the resin-impregnated heartwood becomes hard and rot-resistant after the tree has died. Wood from other locations can also be used, such as the joints where limbs intersect the trunk.  Although most resinous pines can produce fatwood, in the southeastern United States the wood is commonly associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), which historically was highly valued for its high pitch production.


== History ==

The commercial use of fatwood from stumps stemmed from the production of pitch and pine tar. In 1648, a company was formed in Sweden called Norrländska Tjärkompaniet (The Wood Tar Company of North Sweden), and was given exclusive export rights for pine tar by the King of Sweden.


== Composition ==
Coniferous tree sap is a viscous liquid that contains terpene, a volatile hydrocarbon. Over time the evaporation of the terpene changes the state of the sap; it slowly gets thicker until it hardens into resin. New fatwood leaks the sticky sap, while in aged fatwood the sap has hardened and is no longer sticky. At every stage of the aging process, fatwood will burn readily, unless excessively damp.


== Wood kindling and tinder ==
Because of the flammability of terpene, fatwood is prized for use as kindling in starting fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of fatwood can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder. The pitch-soaked wood produces an oily, sooty smoke, and it is recommended that one should not cook on a fire until all the fatwood has completely burned out.


== Distribution ==
There are between 105 and 125 species classified as resinous pine trees around the world. Species usable for fatwood are distributed across a range including Eurasia, where they range from the Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula and Scotland east to the Russian Far East. From the Philippines, Norway, Finland and Sweden (Scots Pine), and eastern Siberia (Siberian Dwarf Pine), and south to northernmost Africa. From the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra. In North America, they range from 66°N in Canada (Jack Pine), to Central America to 12°N in Nicaragua (Caribbean Pine). The highest diversity in the genus occurs in Mexico and California. In the sub-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, including Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, the trees are not indigenous but were introduced. Anywhere there is a pine tree or pine stump, there can be fatwood that can be found on top of the ground, but it is more concentrated and preserved in stumps.


=== The United States ===
In the United States the pine tree Pinus palustris, known as the longleaf pine, once covered as much as  90,000,000 acres (360,000 km2) but due to timber harvesting was reduced by between 95% and 97%. The trees grow very large (up to 150 feet), taking 100 to 150 years to mature and can live up to 500 years. The wood was prized and cutting resulted in many hundreds of thousands of stumps that are very resinous, do not rot, and eventually become fatwood. This ushered in a new industry for many years. There is still a market for the wood, but supplies are less abundant. Due to the length of growing time, the Pinus taeda, also called the loblolly pine, replaced it for commercial replanting, with an economic maturity of only 38 to 45 years.


== Industrial uses ==
Industrial uses for fatwood include production of turpentine; when fatwood is cooked down in a fire kiln, the heavier resin product that results is pine tar. The steam that vaporizes from this process is turned into a liquid that becomes turpentine.

Finite element method,"The finite element method  is a numerical method of solving systems of differential equations. They are used extensively in many fields of engineering because they require very little knowledge of mathematics beyond basic algebra to use. It belongs to the Methods of Weighted residuals. The problem is formulated such that some conditions are satisfied exactly, while others are satisfied only approximately or numerically (i.e., the ""residual"" being the difference between the exact solution and the approximate solution is weighted and minimized to get the best approximation).
While the ease of setting up a problem using finite elements and getting a solution is the reason for its popularity, it is also the cause of its frequent misuse and distrust of the answers obtained. Usually you have to check your results with an experiment before your model is acceptable for use. The use of finite elements in structural analysis is in particular poorly managed. Engineers typically begin working with FEM having very little knowledge of numerical methods or knowledge of finite element behavior. There are no standards and guidelines for modeling and few managers who understand well enough to regulate modeling. It has led to mistrust of the method, its arrested development, and some very bad analysis being performed that is copied by others. Much aircraft structural design is analyzed using FEM.

Colloquium on Violence & Religion,"The Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&R) is an international organization dedicated to “exploring, critiquing, and developing” the mimetic theory proposed by the French historian, literary critic, and anthropological philosopher René Girard. Membership includes scholars of theology, religious studies, literary studies, philosophy, psychology, and other academic fields as well as clergy and other practitioners.
Girard's work focused on the sources of human violence in mimetic (unconsciously imitative) desire and the centrality of religion in the formation of culture through the management of violence (the single-victim mechanism or scapegoat effect), but the scope of the Colloquium on Violence & Religion's interest has expanded beyond violence to mimetic desire's positive potential and beyond religion to other disciplines.
The Colloquium on Violence & Religion is affiliated with regional organizations around the world devoted to Girard's work, mimetic theory, and peacemaking.


== History ==
The Colloquium on Violence & Religion began with a meeting in 1990 at Stanford University with theologians James G. Williams, Robert Hamerton-Kelly, and Charles Mabee as its three co-founders. When constituted formally in 1991, it formed a board with Girard as honorary chair; Raymund Schwager, a theologian from the University of Innsbruck, as president; Williams as executive secretary; and Wolfgang Palaver (de), also a theologian from Innsbruck, as editor of the newsletter. Prominent board members have included James Alison, Eric Gans, and Walter Wink.


== Publications ==
Michigan State University Press publishes the annual journal of Colloquium on Violence & Religion, Contagion: Journal of Violence, Mimesis, and Culture (ISSN 1930-1200) and two related series of books: Breakthroughs in Mimetic Theory and Studies in Violence, Mimesis, and Culture.
Colloquium on Violence & Religion also publishes a quarterly online newsletter, The Bulletin of the Colloquium on Violence and Religion.
A complete bibliography is included in the fully searchable Index Theologicus database.


== Annual meeting ==
Colloquium on Violence & Religion holds an annual summer meeting, usually in July. The location has recently rotated in a three-year cycle between sites in North America, Europe, and the rest of the world. It also meets in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in November.

La Sociedad Interamericana de Astronomía en la Cultura,"La Sociedad Interamericana de Astronomía en la Cultura (SIAC) is an organization dedicated to bringing together professionals in the field of cultural astronomy in the Americas.


== History ==
SIAC was founded during the Symposium on Ethno- and Archaeoastronomy of the International Congress of Americanists (Simposio de etno y arqueoastronomía del Congreso Internacional de Americanistas) in Santiago, Chile, in 2003. During this meeting, present researchers discussed the necessity of having a professional organization in Latin America dedicated to cultural astronomy and founded the organization. In 2011, the organization applied for and received grant funding and began to organize more meetings.


== Mission and activities ==
The main objective of SIAC is to promote the exchange and development of interdisciplinary research concerning astronomical knowledge and practices in their cultural context, as an important contribution to understanding the relationships between human societies and the environment in which they are located.
SIAC seeks to promote professional meetings (congresses, workshops, schools) and activities in cultural astronomy in the Americas. As of 2024, the Society has members from 13 countries, most of them in Latin America. Together with SEAC (Société Européenne pour l'Astronomie dans la Culture) and ISSAC (International Society for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture), SIAC is one of the three international associations of cultural astronomy.
SIAC also keeps a catalog of publications that includes books, magazines, and newsletters.

Touron,"Touron is a derogatory term combining the words ""tourist"" with ""moron"" to describe any person who, while on vacation, commits an act of pure stupidity. The term is considered park ranger slang that describes how some tourists act in national parks. The phrase indicates an act of ignorance and is known to be used in different subcultures. It is also used to describe tourists in general when they are outside their normal ""comfort zone"".


== Etymology ==
Early mentions are '=""touron n. A tourist, usually an annoying one. —""Say wha?"", The Washington Post, September 20, 1987"". In 1991 the term was cited in: ""Over at U.S. 192 and State Road 535, westbound touron — (a combo of tourists and morons, according to a local dj) are constantly making sudden U-turns from the left lane, causing oodles of rear-end wrecks. —""The Road Toad,"" Orlando Sentinel, September 29, 1991"". The National Park Service constantly warns park guests about the dangers of wildlife and the natural surroundings. Images and video of tourist in dangerous situations are uploaded to the internet and demonstrate their, often stunning, behavior. Tourists acting as tourons can drive erratically. A common occurrence is to see vehicles stopped in the middle of the road at the first sighting of deer. Drivers and occupants leave the vehicle to take pictures, backing traffic up for miles. The term is used as humor to defend against the usual aggravation of continued exposure to tourists by even local residents of tourist areas.
More recently, the term 'touron' has been used frequently to describe tourists who visit Horse Guards on London's Whitehall and act in an inexplicably stupid way. This behaviour has been extensively documented on the popular YouTube Channel 'London City Walks'.
It has been argued that everyone is a touron outside their own home and away from familiar surroundings. Just being a traveler in a foreign location could make one a touron. Author Kelsey Timmerman believes that: ""A touron is one part eager tourist and one part well-meaning moron. You yourself have likely been a touron at one time or another."" Tourists become touronic out of an innocent reaction to places they have never been due to a greater curiosity.

Soft sculpture,"Soft sculpture is a type of sculpture or three dimensional form that incorporates materials such as cloth, fur, foam rubber, plastic, paper, fibre or similar supple and nonrigid materials. Soft sculptures can be stuffed, sewn, draped, stapled, glued, hung, draped or woven. These materials and techniques distinguish soft sculptures from more traditional hard sculptures made from, for example, stone, bronze or wood that are then carved or modelled.   
Soft sculpture is an old German technique very popular in Japan with artists like Yayoi Kusama boosting the heritages of this new and innovative medium for interior designers.
Soft sculptures were popularised in the 1960s by artists such as Claes Oldenburg and Yayoi Kusama. Claes Oldenburg and other members of the Art Pop Movement are accredited with the creation of soft sculpture. During this time period members of the Art Pop Movement created art with themes of the times such as pop culture, consumerism, and mass production. Oldenburg specifically would take average everyday items and make them larger than life; one of his most notable works of this time is the Floor Burger. The Floor Burger is primarily made out of canvas filled with rubber foam and cardboard. It contains a large hamburger patty nestled in the middle of two tan buns with a pickle for garnish on the top. Yayoi Kusama also is responsible for the rise of soft sculpture in the 1960s, although she believes that Claes Oldenburg copied some of her pieces. One of her most popular soft sculpture works is entitled Accumulation No. 1. Kusama hand sewed and painted projections she called ""phalluses,"" and placed them on an armchair. After this works first exhibition, people were surprised that Kusama had sexualized an everyday object.
Soft sculpture was also a key feature during the 1970s in Post-Minimalist art. Artists during this time would create sculptures using materials that they had around them. A key artist during this time was Eva Hesse. One of Eva's most popular works does not have a title. It is composed of latex, string, rope and wire suspended from the ceiling.
More recently, contemporary sculptors like Janet Echelman have expanded the genre to address contemporary topics.

The following is a list of other artists who have worked with soft sculpture:

Feather tights,"Feather tights is the name usually given by art historians to a form of costume seen on Late Medieval depictions of angels, which shows them as if wearing a body suit with large scale-like overlapping downward-pointing elements representing feathers, as well as having large wings.  Other sources use feathered angels to describe the style. The style is assumed to derive from actual costumes worn by those playing angels in medieval religious drama, with the ""feathered"" elements presumably flaps or lappets of cloth or leather sewn onto a body suit. The feathers on angels in art can often to be seen to stop abruptly at the neck, wrists and ankles, sometimes with a visible hemline, reflecting these originals.
Mary Magdalene's hair suit is another iconographic feature, with a background in hagiographic legend, whose depiction apparently borrows from religious drama.
Historians of English churches tend to refer to the feather tights style as 15th century, and by implication essentially English, but it can be seen in several major late medieval European works from the late 14th to early 16th centuries.  These include the Holy Thorn Reliquary in the British Museum, made by a court goldsmith in Paris in the 1390s, and on two wooden angels from South Germany around 1530 (Museum Kunstpalast Düsseldorf, right), as well as two stone ones hovering over the Lamentation of Christ by Tilman Riemenschneider at Maidbronn (1526), and others on Veit Stoss's wooden altarpiece at Bamberg Cathedral (1520–1523).  There is also a figure with greenish-black feathers, in Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece of 1515.
The ""devil in his feathers"" featured in the Chester Midsummer Watch Parade as late as the 1590s, provided by the butcher's guild; these parades had originally used the costumes from the Chester Plays, where ""the devil in his feathers, all ragger [ragged] and rent"" also appeared. An early English version of the style is found in the Egerton Genesis Picture Book, an unusual and much discussed illuminated manuscript attributed by the British Library (who own it) to ""England, S.E. or N. (Norwich or Durham?)"" in the ""3rd quarter of the 14th century"".


== Context ==

It is believed that this practice arose from medieval liturgical dramas and mystery plays, in which the actors portraying angels wore garments covered with feathers to emphasize their power of flight, often standing on ""clouds"" of wool. Costumed angels also might be introduced for one-off special occasions: at the coronation of Henry VII's queen, Elizabeth of York, in 1487 an angel swinging a large censer was lowered from the roof of Old St Paul's Cathedral, and at the marriage of their son Arthur to Catherine of Aragon in 1501, the archangel Raphael was part of the ceremony, with ""goldyn and glyteryng wingis and ffedyrs of many and sundry colours"".
The feathering might be used as a substitute for other clothing, or under vestments or Saint Michael's armour.  Feathered tights are not to be confused with the feathers of the extra pairs of wings traditionally attributed to cherubim and other higher orders of angels, which are often shown pointing downwards covering the legs.  Further enhancements to actor's costumes might include expensive real peacock feathers to represent the ""eyed"" wing feathers of the cherubim; elsewhere whether real or simulated feathers, or a combination, were worn by actors is unclear.  The more common and traditional angelic costume of an alb-like robe flowing to the feet was also used in drama, as records show.
The depictions may be in wood, stone or alabaster, or glass.  The well-preserved church of St Mary the Virgin, Ewelme has examples in wood on the roof and the top of the large font cover, and in stone and alabaster round the tomb monument to Alice de la Pole, Duchess of Suffolk, and the Beauchamp Chapel in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick has ones in stone (still painted) and glass.  Other examples from English churches in painted or stained glass are at Great Malvern Priory, St Nicholas, Blakeney and Cawston, Norfolk, St Peter Hungate in Norwich and the Victoria and Albert Museum (Norwich School), which also has a large painted Nottingham alabaster figure of the Archangel Michael some 70 cm tall. The rare surviving wall paintings on the crossing-arch at St Mary's Attleborough, Norfolk include two prominent feathered angels.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Mary Magdalene's hair suit ==

A similar depiction of the penitent Mary Magdalene appears in some Southern German works around mostly 1500, but with body hair rather than feathers. The earliest may be in the scene of Mary's last Holy Communion in Lucas Moser's Altar with scenes from the life of the Magdalene in Tiefenbronn, from 1432. Tilman Riemenschneider's carved figure in the Münnerstadt Altar (1490–1492), now the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich, is the best known. According to medieval legend the Magdalene had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a prostitute and her life as a follower of Jesus. Her story became conflated in the West with that of Saint Mary of Egypt, a 4th-century prostitute turned hermit, whose clothes wore out and fell off in the desert. In earlier medieval depictions Mary's long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty, but in these her hair is more naturalistic and does not do so.
Instead she has a coat of hair somewhat like a dog's, ending rather neatly at the neck, wrists and ankles, suggesting derivation from a theatrical costume, as with the feather suits. The suits, which are mainly consistent in depiction, do not cover her breasts or knees, or sometimes elbows. The bare patches on the knees and elbows probably are meant to have been worn bare by Mary praying on her knees, resting her elbows on a rock ledge, as she is often shown in later paintings of the Penitent Magdalen. The lack of hair on the breasts presumably follows the pattern of body hair typical of mammals and familiar to late medieval Germans from farm animals such as sheep and cattle.

Most such images depict the ""Ascension"" or Elevation of Mary Magdalene, showing the regular visits of angels to Mary's desert home (actually in Provence in the South of France according to the legend) to raise her into the air and feed her heavenly food.  In the words of William Caxton's English translation of the Golden Legend:

... the blessed Mary Magdalene, desirous of sovereign contemplation, sought a right sharp desert, and took a place which was ordained by the angel of God, and abode there by the space of thirty years without knowledge of anybody. In which place she had no comfort of running water, ne solace of trees, ne of herbs. And that was because our Redeemer did do show it openly, that he had ordained for her refection celestial, and no bodily meats. And every day at every hour canonical she was lifted up in the air of angels, and heard the glorious song of the heavenly companies with her bodily ears. Of which she was fed and filled with right sweet meats, and then was brought again by the angels unto her proper place, in such wise as she had no need of corporal nourishing.
Moser's altar shows the scene of her last Holy Communion after her return to the world and just before her death, as recounted in the Golden Legend:

[Saint Maximinus] saw the blessed Mary Magdalene standing in the quire or choir yet among the angels that brought her, and was lift up from the earth the space of two or three cubits. And praying to our Lord she held up her hands, and when S. Maximin saw her, he was afraid to approach to her. And she returned to him, and said: Come hither mine own father, and flee not thy daughter. And when he approached and came to her, as it is read in the books of the said S. Maximin, for the customable vision that she had of angels every day, the cheer and visage of her shone as clear as it had been the rays of the sun. And then all the clerks and the priests aforesaid were called, and Mary Magdalene received the body and blood of our Lord of the hands of the bishop with great abundance of tears, and after, she stretched her body tofore the altar, and her right blessed soul departed from the body and went to our Lord.
The relief panels on the inside of the shutters of the Münnerstadt Altar show four scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene, with her covered in body hair in the last two, showing her last Communion and burial (these are still in the church).

Engineering arose in early civilization as a general discipline for the creation of large scale structures such as irrigation, architecture, and military projects. Advances in food production through irrigation allowed a portion of the population to become specialists in Ancient Babylon.
All six of the classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC, and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991-1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Assyrians were notable in their use of metallurgy and incorporation of iron weapons. Many of their advancements were in military equipment. They were not the first to develop them, but did make advancements on the wheel and the chariot. They made use of pivot-able axles on their wagons, allowing easy turning. They were also one of the first armies to use the move-able siege tower and battering ram.
The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient societies. The pulley appeared in Mesopotamia in 1,500 BC, improving water transportation. German Archaeologist Robert Koldewey found that the Hanging Gardens likely used a mechanical pump powered by these pulleys to transport water to the roof gardens. The Mesopotamians would advance even further by replacing ""the substitution of continuous for intermittent motion, and the rotary for back-and-forth motion"" by 1,200 BC.
In Ancient Egypt, the screw pump is another example of the use of engineering to boost efficiency of water transportation. Although the Early Egyptians built colossal structures such as the pyramids, they did not develop pulleys for the lifting of heavy stone, and used the wheel very little.
The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.
In Ancient Greece, Archimedes (287–212 BC) developed several key theories in the field of mechanical engineering including mechanical advantage, the Law of the Lever, and his name sake, Archimedes’ law. In Ptolematic Egypt, the Museum of Alexandria developed crane pulleys with block and tackles to lift stones. These cranes were powered with human tread wheels and were based on earlier Mesopotamian water-pulley systems. The Greeks would later develop mechanical artillery independently of the Chinese. The first of these would fire darts, but advancements allowed for stone to be tossed at enemy fortifications or formations.


== Late Antiquity to early Middle Ages ==
In Roman Egypt, Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD) created the first steam-powered device, the Aeolipile. The first of its kind, it did not have the capability to move or power anything but its own rotation.
In China, Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) improved a water clock and invented a seismometer. Ma Jun (200–265 AD) invented a chariot with differential gears.
Leo the Philosopher is noted to have worked on a signal system using clocks in the Byzantine Empire in 850, connecting Constantinople with the Cicilian Frontier and was a continuation of the complex city clocks in Eastern Rome. These grand machines diffused into the Arabian Empire under Harun al-Rashid.
Another grand mechanical device was the Organ, which was reintroduced in 757 when Constantine V gifted one to Pepin the short.
With the exception of a few machines, engineering and science stagnated in the West due to the collapse of the Roman Empire during late antiquity.


== Middle Ages ==
During the Islamic Golden Age (7th to 15th century), Muslim inventors made remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology. Al-Jazari, who was one of them, wrote his famous Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices in 1206 and presented many mechanical designs. Al-Jazari is also the first known person to create devices such as the crankshaft and camshaft, which now form the basics of many mechanisms.
The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD. The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.
The automatic flute player, which was invented in the 9th century by the Banū Mūsā brothers in Baghdad, is the first known example of a programmable machine. The work of the Banu Musa was influenced by their Hellenistic forebears, but it also makes significant improvements over Greek creation. The pinned-barrel mechanism, which allowed for programmable variations in the rhythm and melody of the music, was the key contribution given by the Banu Musa. In 1206, the Muslim inventor Al-Jazari (in the Artuqid Sultnate) described a drum machine which may have been an example of a programmable automaton.
The cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD, and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century, both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. The crankshaft and camshaft were invented by Al-Jazari in Northern Mesopotamia circa 1206, and they later became central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls.
The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer Su Song (1020–1101 AD) incorporated an escapement mechanism into his astronomical clock tower two centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval European clocks and also invented the world's first known endless power-transmitting chain drive.
The Middle Ages saw the wide spread adoption of machines to aid in labor. The many rivers of England and northern Europe allowed the power of moving water to be utilized. The water-mill became instrumental in the production of many goods such as food, fabric, leathers, and papers. These machines used were some of the first to use cogs and gears, which greatly increased the mills productivity. The camshaft allowed rotational force to be converted into directional force. Less significantly, tides of bodies of water were also harnessed.
Wind-power later became the new source of energy in Europe, supplementing the water mill. This advancement moved out of Europe into the Middle East during the Crusades.
Metallurgy advanced by a large degree during the Middle Ages, with higher quality iron allowing for more sturdy constructions and designs. Mills and mechanical power provided a consistent supply of trip-hammer strikes and air from the bellows.


== European Renaissance ==
During the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in England.  Sir Isaac Newton formulated Newton's Laws of Motion and developed Calculus, the mathematical basis of physics. Newton was reluctant to publish his works for years, but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues, such as Sir Edmond Halley, much to the benefit of all mankind. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz is also credited with creating Calculus during this time period.
Leonardo Da Vinci was a notable engineer, designing and studying many mechanical systems that were focused around transportation and warfare His designs would later be compared to early aircraft design.
Although wind power provided a source of energy away from riverside estate and saw massive improvements in its harnessing, it could not replace the consistent and strong power of the watermill. Water would remain the primary source of power of pre-industrial urban industry through the Renaissance.


== Industrial Revolution ==

At the end of the Renaissance, scientists and engineers were beginning to experiment with steam power. Most of the early apparatuses faced problems of low horsepower, inefficiency, or danger. The need arose for an effective and economical power source because of the flooding of deep-mines in England, which could not be pumped out using alternative methods. The first working design was Thomas Savory's 1698 patent. He continuously worked on improving and marketing the invention across England. At the same time, others were working on improvements to Savory's design, which did not transfer heat effectively.
Thomas Newcomen would take all the advancements of the engineers and develop the Newcomen Atmospheric Engine. This new design would greatly reduce heat loss, move water directly from the engine, and allow variety of proportions to be built in.
The Industrial Revolution brought steam powered factories utilizing mechanical engineering concepts. These advances allowed an incredible increase in production scale, numbers, and efficiency.
During the 19th century, material sciences advances had begun to allow implementation of steam engines into Steam Locomotives and Steam-Powered Ships, quickly increasing the speed at which people and goods could move across the world. The reason for these advances were the machine tools were developed in England, Germany, and Scotland. These allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering. They brought with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them.
At the near end of the Industrial Revolution, internal combustion engine technology brought with it the piston airplane and automobile. Aerospace Engineering would develop in the early 20th century as a offshoot of mechanical engineering, eventually incorporating rocketry.
Coal was replaced by oil based derivatives for many applications.


== Modern Age ==
With the advents of computers in the 20th century, more precise design and manufacturing methods were available to engineers. Automated and Computerized manufacturing allowed many new fields to emerge from Mechanical Engineering such as Industrial Engineering. Although a majority of automobiles remain to be gas powered, electric vehicles have risen as a feasible alternative.
Because of the increased complexity of engineering projects, many disciplines of engineer collaborate and specialize in sub fields. One of these collaborations is the field of robotics, in which electrical engineers, computer engineers, and mechanical engineers can specialize in and work together.


=== Professional associations ===
The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 Institution of Mechanical Engineers, thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society Institution of Civil Engineers.
In the United States, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) was formed in 1880, becoming the third such professional engineering society, after the American Society of Civil Engineers (1852) and the American Institute of Mining Engineers (1871).


=== Education ===
The first schools in the United States to offer a mechanical engineering education were the United States Military Academy in 1817, an institution now known as Norwich University in 1819, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1825. Education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science.
In the 20th century, many governments began regulating both the title of engineer and the practice of engineering, requiring a degree from an accredited university and to past a qualifying test.

Crumple zone,Crumple zones in a car help to reduce the impact of force on the people in the car when the car crashes into a solid object or another vehicle. The car is designed to crumple in a way so it absorbs energy to decelerate for longer and so reduce the force and severity of the crash on the people in the car.,0
Reaction wood,"Reaction wood in a woody plant is wood that forms in place of normal wood as a response to gravity, where the cambial cells are oriented other than vertically. It is typically found on branches and leaning stems. It is an example of mechanical acclimation in trees.
Progressive bending and cracking would occur in parts of the tree undergoing predominantly tensile or compressive stresses were it not for the localised production of reaction wood, which differs from ordinary wood in its mechanical properties. Reaction wood may be laid down in wider than normal annual increments, so that the cross section is often asymmetric or elliptical. The structure of cells and vessels is also different, resulting in additional strength. The effect of reaction wood is to help maintain the angle of the bent or leaning part by resisting further downward bending or failure.
There are two different types of reaction wood, which represent two different approaches to the same problem by woody plants:

In most angiosperms reaction wood is called tension wood. Tension wood forms on the side of the part of the plant that is under tension, pulling it towards the affecting force (upwards, in the case of a branch). It has a higher proportion of cellulose than normal wood. Tension wood may have as high as 60% cellulose.
In gymnosperms and amborella it is called compression wood. Compression wood forms on the side of the plant that is under compression, thereby lengthening/straightening the bend. Compression wood has a higher proportion of lignin than normal wood. Compression wood has only about 30% cellulose compared to 42% in normal softwood. Its lignin content can be as high as 40%.
The controlling factor behind reaction wood appears to be the hormone auxin, although the exact mechanism is not clear. In a leaning stem, the normal flow of auxin down the tree is displaced by gravity and it accumulates on the lower side.  The formation of reaction wood may act in conjunction with other corrective or adaptive mechanisms in woody plants, such as thigomorphism (adaptive response to flexure) and gravitropism (the correction of, rather than the support of, lean) and the auxin-controlled balance of growth rates and growth direction between stems and branches. The term ‘adaptive growth' therefore includes, but is not synonymous with, the formation of reaction wood.
As a rule, reaction wood is undesirable in any structural application, primarily as its mechanical properties are different from normal wood: it alters the uniform structural properties of timber. Reaction wood can twist, cup or warp dramatically during machining.  This movement can occur during the milling process, making it occasionally dangerous to perform certain operations without appropriate safety controls in place.  For instance, ripping a piece of reaction wood on a table saw without a splitter or riving knife installed can lead to kick back of the stock.  Reaction wood also responds to moisture differently from normal wood.
Traditionally, compression wood does have niche applications. For instance, hunters in north Eurasia and the American Arctic were known to harvest compression wood for bow staves, because the increased density and compression strength of this wood enabled them to make functional weapons out of tree species that would otherwise be unsuitable for this purpose, due to their low strength and low density.

Bottom-up and top-down design,"The terms bottom-up design and top-down design are used when organizing or classifying information. The terms are also used in different fields of engineering when talking about building more complex systems.  
In this context, a top-down approach means that people look at the more general case first, and later break down the information into more specialized cases. It is also known as stepwise refinement. When designing software, people speak about decomposition, or specialization. . A top–down approach starts with the big picture, then breaks down into smaller segments. 
Bottom-up works the other way around. People first design more specialized systems, and then look what these systems have in common. The subsystems then become special cases or extensions of the more general system, and their complexity is reduced, to only handle the cases where they are different from the more general system, or where they extend it.  People speak about generalizing several components. 
When talking in ma morge general way, there are the concepts of deductive and inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning starts with the more general case to the more specialized case. Inductive reasoning takes several of the more specialized  cases, and tries to find similarities or patterns, generalizing them. Still other words, which are more widely used in engineering are decomposition and aggregation. Decomposition is about looking at the parts, aggregation is about combining several of those parts.

Marine construction,"Marine construction is the process of building structures in or adjacent to large bodies of water, usually the sea. These structures can be built for a variety of purposes, including transportation, energy production, and recreation. Marine construction can involve the use of a variety of building materials, predominantly steel and concrete. Some examples of marine structures include ships, offshore platforms, moorings, pipelines, cables, wharves, bridges, tunnels, breakwaters and docks. Marine construction may require diving work, but professional diving is expensive and dangerous, and may involve relatively high risk, and the types of tools and equipment that can both function underwater and be safely used by divers are limited. Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and other types of submersible equipment are a lower risk alternative, but they are also expensive and limited in applications, so when reasonably practicable, most underwater construction involves either removing the water from the building site by dewatering behind a cofferdam or inside a caisson, or prefabrication of structural units off-site with mainly assembly and installation done on-site.


== Environmental influences ==
Some aspects of the marine environment that complicate construction:

Distance from permanent facilities causes logistical problems for provision of materials, equipment, power supplies, and accommodation.: Ch 1.2 
Hydrostatic pressure due to depth in the water column. Hydrostatic pressure is linear with depth and increases at approximately 1 bar for every ten metres of depth.: Ch 1.3 
Temperature of the water and the air above it. Sea surface temperature can vary from a minimum of −2 °C (28 °F) to a maximum of about 32 °C (90 °F). Higher surface temperatures decrease rapidly with depth, and generally reach a steady-state of about 2 °C (36 °F) by about 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), though on Australia's Northwest Shelf, water and seabed temperature may exceed 30 °C (86 °F) at a depth of 250 metres (820 ft). Air temperatures may vary much more, and though the water has a moderating effect, the air temperature more variable and may be much more extreme.: Ch 1.4 
Seawater and splash zone chemistry: Ch 1.5 
Biofouling: Ch 1.5 
Currents cause drag loading on structures and equipment. There are several different types of currents in the seas. Categorised by their cause, these include geostrophic, tidal, wind-driven, oceanic circulation and density, as well as those caused by river discharge. River currents are driven mainly by gravity, but differ laterally and vertically. The highest velocity in river currents is usually near the outer bank in a bend, and hey also locally increase around obstructions to their flow. Current may also spin off eddies, and their lateral boundaries may vary considerably over the short term. There may also be short or long term vertical components in some areas, the upwellings and downwellings often associated with bottom topography and winds in coastal areas. Currents may be stratified vertically, even to the extent that they may flow in opposing directions at the surface and at the bottom. Their influence on underwater construction is a consequence of the drag forces induced and the transport of unconsolidated sediment, particularly by scour, both during and after construction. Water passing over an immersed surface can also cause lift forces, proportional to the square of the velocity, which can complicate operations, so the variations of instantaneous velocity induced by waves can further complicate matters.: Ch 1.6 
Waves are a further environmental influence near the surface, which cause perturbations in all six degrees of freedom on a floating object, and can exert large forces on a fixed object. They are a major cause of delays and reduced operating efficiency, and may be the major design criterion for fixed structures. Tsunamis are a class of wave which occur relatively seldom but can have a devastating effect due to the large amounts of energy they can carry over long distances at high speeds. The depth to which a wave has significant motion is a function of wave length, and to a lesser extent, on wave height.: Ch 1.7 
Wind
Tides and storm surges
Rain, snow and fog reduce visibility, but with radar and precision positioning systems they are not as serious a hazard as in the past. Nevertheless, they may cause delays in some operations. In heavy rainfall appreciable quantities of water may enter unprotected openings, and must be removed before it has adverse effects on stability due to free-surface. Fog may be of the summer fog type which forms some distance above the water and may leave a narrow band of clear air just above the water, or winter type, where there mat be dense fog just above the water but clear skies a short distance up. Rain, fog and snow may prevent helicopter operations, which generally require good visibility for landing. Snow may present the additional problem of removal to prevent accumulation. Spray caused by wind and waves can also dump large amounts of water which must be drained, and in colder conditions may freeze and build up a burden of ice. Severe spray may prevent people from working on deck. Atmospheric icing, also known as black ice can occur in sub-Arctic regions, when the air is humid and the temperature is low. Ice forms directly on cold surfaces and can accumulate rapidly, adding topside weight and increasing wind drag. Icing and frozen spray may occur in the same regions and in similar conditions. Lightning is generally not a major problem to steel and concrete structure with adequate lightning protection, but is a hazard to personnel working in high exposed areas.: Ch 1.10

Scour: Ch 1.14

== Geotechnical aspects ==
The geology of the seabed has a strong influence on almost any marine structure. The seabed is the substrate on which the structure must stand, and both the morphology and the material affect the design and construction. It is therefore necessary for accurate and reliable geological surveys to be made before a construction project can be started. There have been developments in sampling of seabeds but some soils remain difficult to analyse and sampling may not produce results as accurate as would be desired. In-place strength may be greater than conventional sampling methods indicate, and sampling methods may not recover and identify critical constituents due to insufficient sampling. Failure to identify potential problems can lead to delays and cost overruns. Many marine structures cover extensive areas, and the soil properties may vary considerably. Cost and time constraints may make it difficult to gather sufficient samples from borings to fully describe the substrate. Other methods for remote substrate analysis may identify potential variations for closer examination.: Ch 2.1 
Bottom material is often sedimentary, and in deeper water, may range from extremely fine, low density silts to loose gravels, to dense, highly compacted sands. Granular sediments may be subject to liquefaction if strongly disturbed, as by earthquakes, cyclic impact of storm waves, or crushing by sea ice.: Ch 2.2  When this occurs the soil can behave like a dense liquid. This can also happen during some construction processes, such as piledriving.: Ch 2.3  The presence of large boulders in glacial till deposits can give a misleading impression of bedrock, hiding the further extent of softer sediment below.: Ch 2.5 
In arctic regions, permafrost can form an unreliable foundation, and deeply buried clathrates can be a problem when drilling, but are usually too deep to be a problem for construction.: Ch 2.7 
Methane can occur at shallow depths in delta sediments with significant quantities of organic matter, and in arctic silts. These van reduce the shear strength of silty and clay soils. A sudden, large release may temporarily reduce water density sufficiently to cause vessels or drill rigs to sink, and can cause an explosion or fire at the surface.: Ch 2.10 
Clays may initially support a steep slope when excavated, but are subject to creep and sudden large-scale collapse when subjected to shock loads or vibration.: Ch 2.11 
Unconsolidated sand – seasonal shifts.: Ch 2.13 
Underwater sand dunes can form where there are strong currents, which may move with the currents, as sand is lifted by flow over the back of the dune, and dropped at the front. This can be a problem when laying pipelines, and may require deeper than usual burial.: Ch 2.14 


== Ecological and societal impact ==
Topics of concern:

Oil and petroleum products
Toxic chemicals
Contaminated soils
Construction wastes
Turbidity
Sediment transport, scour, and erosion
Air pollution
Disturbance and destruction of marine habitats
Noise

Archaeological impact. Early civilisations often left traces of their presence in coastal areas and along river banks, which may be found during construction work. Legislation will generally provide guidance on how to manage such sites when they are discovered.


== Materials and fabrication ==
Marine construction materials subjected to coarse conditions including corrosion and temperature change. Fabrication can also be complicated by the large scale of some structures, and the need to transport them to the site for modular installation, and possible thermal differences between components and the fabrication and installation sites. The most commonly used materials in marine construction are concrete and steel.: Ch 4 


=== Steel ===
Durability in the marine environment is affected by corrosion, both inside and outside of hollow structures, and can be particularly severe in crevices and cracks. The interior surfaces of steel tanks may also be corroded by liquids and other substances stored in them. The rate of corrosion may be increased by abrasion or erosion, and also by higher temperature, higher oxygen concentration, and the presence of chloride ions. Corrosion is therefore usually most severe in the splash zone.: Ch 4.2 


==== Materials ====
Steels are measured by the following material properties:: Ch 4.3 

Minimum yield strength
Minimum ultimate strength
Minimum elongation at rupture
Notch toughness at low temperatures
Properties in the thickness direction (properties on the z-axis)
Weldability
Fatigue endurance
Alloy composition
Corrosion resistance


==== Fabrication and Welding ====
For major projects, coded welders (approved welder, tested against a particular standard) may be stipulated, and non-destructive and mechanical testing may be specified. Design of joints and fabrication methods should take stress raisers and ambient conditions into consideration to minimise the risk of fatigue cracking, and weld preparation and finishing processes should also take this into consideration.: Ch 4.2 


==== Erection and assembly ====


==== Coatings and corrosion protection ====

Steel is subject atmospheric corrosion, splash zone corrosion, crevice corrosion, and other causes, including corrosion due aerobic and anaerobic bacteria interacting. Seawater rates are twice that of freshwater. Coatings may delay the start of corrosion by 10 to 20 years.: Ch 4.2 
When reasonably practicable, workshop conditions of suitable humidity and protection from hazardous weather should be used when painting and coating steel structures, and keeping joint surfaces clean for welding. This may require temporary shelter to be erected, and heating or dehumidification may be required.: Ch 4.2 
Sacrificial anodes or impressed current cathodic protection are used to protect steel in immersed areas. Anodes must be secured to prevent damage during transport. Effective connection are required between anodes and structures. It is prohibited in en closed spaces or where gas may be trapped because hydrogen may be generated and may produce an explosive atmosphere.: Ch 4.2 
Steel coatings may be applied to steel that will primarily be underwater if the coating has the required resistance to cathodic disbondment. Additional protection may be provided by materials like copper nickel or by usage of additional steel to thicken the area allowed for corrosion. Allowances of 0.1 to 0.3 mm per year are typical.: Ch 4.2 


=== Structural concrete ===

Prestressed and reinforced concrete have been used for several decades for the construction of large offshore platforms, mostly in the North Sea. Concrete is also used together with steel structure in hybrid and composite designs, and cement grout is used on steel platforms to bond piles to the skirts and jacket legs.: Ch 4.3.1 
The component materials must be well matched to work effectively. It must be durable when exposes to the sea and air. Careful design and quality control during fabrication help to provide long service with low maintenance. The splash zone is most vulnerable to seawater damage, while the immersed zone and areas below the mudline have few problems. The atmospheric and splash zones have high susceptibility to chloride and carbon dioxide corrosion of the reinforcing steel.: Ch 4.3.1

High-performance concrete
Ultra-high performance concrete
Low-density structural concrete

==== Prestressing tendons and accessories ====


==== Embedments ====


==== Conveyance and placement ====


==== Curing ====

==== Formwork and support ====


=== Combined steel–concrete structures ===
Two forms of combined steel and concrete construction have been used to advantage:
The hybrid approach:

Structural steel superstructures supported by concrete substructures,
Structural steel frames supporting exterior concrete walls and slabs,
Steel hinge providing an articulated connection between a concrete base and a steel or concrete column.
For these structures, the main problem is the working of the joint under cyclic-dynamic loads, which can frequently be managed by pre-stressing the connection. Care must be taken to ensure that the stresses set up by this method are of the correct type to suit each material, and that the bearing loads are evenly distributed to avoid bursting stresses.: Ch 4.4.1 
The composite approach:: Ch 4.4.2 
Typical examples include:

A concrete deck is connected to a steel beam by casting it over studs welded to the beam top surface. The concrete takes compression, and the steel carries tension and transverse shear. This system is commonly used in bridge construction.: Ch 4.4.2 
Special shear connectors in the form of transverse bars or perforated vertical plates, are welded to the steel.
Two steel plates, spaced apart and tied together by steel webs, bars, or bolts, are filled with concrete. The concrete distributes local loads and carries out of plane shear loads.: Ch 4.4.2 
This type of composite construction appears to have advantages where offshore structures must withstand high local impact forces, such as ice or ship collision, and for the walls of concrete structures where cracks and leakage are unacceptable and difficult or impossible to repair.: Ch 4.4.2 


=== Synthetic and composite materials ===


=== Titanium ===
Titanium has high strength and is very resistant to corrosion, but is also very expensive, so it tends to be used in highly-corrosive environments or as cladding.: Ch 4.6 


=== Rock, sand, and asphaltic-bituminous materials ===

== Marine operations ==

Underwater concreting and grouting: Ch 6.6 
Surveying and navigation: Ch 6.7 
Temporary buoyancy augmentation: Ch 6.8 


=== Seafloor modifications ===
The seafloor may be covered with level sediments that have been consolidated over the years and provide a stable platform, but this is often not the case, and the construction site may be uneven, covered with unconsolidated, weak sediment, lie on a slope, or be irregular, with rock outcroppings or scattered boulders.: Ch 7.1 
There two ways to manage an unsuitable substrate. In the past, most cases of offshore construction adapted the structure to suit the substrate, but the second method is often used for major land structures and can and has been used for shallow water harbor and coastal structures. Seafloor preparation can also have significant potential advantages for deep water. There is normally time available to prepare the site during the lead time for procurement and fabrication of the structure before installation.: Ch 7.1 
Seafloor modifications to improve performance of foundations are intended to provide a stable base of sufficient strength to support the structure and to resist failure and degradation for both a single extreme event and repetitive dynamic loads. In some cases, extensions to the foundations may be placed to protect the structure moving ice or ship collision. These operations may include:: Ch 7.1 
The site may be prepared by dredging, levelling and removal of obstructions.: Ch 7.3  Soft material may be removed, consolidated or reinforced,: Ch 7.6  and high areas of hard material and rock removed.: Ch 7.4  Granular material such as crushed rock, gravel, and sand can be placed and leveled as a practicable and economical fill for a reasonably level and uniform support for structures, either across the whole site, in low areas, or as a replacement for previously removed soft materials.: Ch 7.5 
Sand piles and stone columns can be used to provide better bearing strength for weak soils like silts and clays, and are installed by drilling or driving a mandrel into the soil into which the coarser material is fed before forcing it out under pressure and removing the mandrel. The process is rapid where only small areas need to be improved. This method increases both bearing and shear resistance and can prevent liquefaction. Injection of cementitious material, following land-based grouting procedures, can be used to displace pore water and give a stronger substrate. The cementing pressures must displace the water yet not cause fracturing of the formation by channelization. Cement particles must be small enough to penetrate the interstices, and a wetting agent can be added to the grout to reduce viscosity.: Ch 7.6 

Measures to prevent liquefaction of the substrate: Ch 7.7 
Protection from scour: Ch 7.8

A pile or piling is a vertical or near vertical structural element of a deep foundation, driven or drilled deep into the ground at the building site. There are many reasons why a deep foundation may be preferred, such as large design loads, a poor soil at shallow depth, There are different terms used to describe different types of deep foundations including the pile (which is analogous to a pole), the pier (which is analogous to a column), drilled shafts, and caissons. Piles are generally driven into the ground in situ, and can be made out of timber, steel, reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete.


=== Harbour, river and estuary structures ===

The most common type of harbour structure is the quay or marginal wharf intended for loading and unloading containers. Finger piers are commonly used for transfer of petroleum products, and trestle supports are provided for access to loading platforms and wharves.: Ch 9 
Pile-supported structures consist of steel or concrete piles, driven into soft clays and sands of the seafloor, and usually carry a deck of reinforced concrete. The piles are spaced from 7 to 10 m apart for economy, with a load bearing capacity of 100 to 250 tons each.: Ch 9 
Steel piles are either H-section or tubular, with diameters from 400 to 600 mm. Tubular piles are easier to protect from corrosion.
Water depths for container and cargo ships are about 16 m, with a designed pile capacity of about 200 to 400 tons, so in most cases the pile length will be between 30 and 40 m. Larger container ships may need 20 m of water alongside, and may need piles of 40 to 50 m long to adequately support vertical crane load, and 1 m diameter for lateral stiffness. Petroleum terminals need more depth, usually about 23 m, so the piles are larger and more heavily loaded.: Ch 9 
River structures include locks, low-level dams, overflow structures, and flood walls. Historically, these have usually been constructed behind sheet pile cofferdams to allow the worksite to be dewatered, so that conventional civil engineering construction methods can be used.: Ch 9.3

=== Offshore platforms ===

 

An offshore platform is usually a large structure with facilities to extract and process petroleum and natural gas that lie in rock formations beneath the seabed. Many platforms also have facilities to accommodate the workers, although it is also common to have a separate accommodation platform bridge linked to the production platform. Most platforms engage in activities on the continental shelf, though they can also be used in lakes, inshore waters, and inland seas. Depending on the circumstances, the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor, consist of an artificial island, or float. In some arrangements the main facility may have storage facilities for the processed oil. Remote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by umbilical connections. These sub-sea facilities may include of one or more subsea wells or manifold centres for multiple wells.

=== Submarine pipelines and cables ===

A submarine pipeline is a pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it in a trench.: p583-585  Some of the pipeline may also be on land. Submarine pipelines are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water is also important. A distinction is sometimes made between a flowline and a pipeline. The former is an intrafield pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads, manifolds and the platform within a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an export pipeline, is used to bring the resource to shore. Sizeable pipeline construction projects need to take into account many factors, such as the offshore ecology, geohazards and environmental loading.

Submarine cable is communications or electrical power cable that is laid on or under the seabed.

Beating heart cadaver,"A beating heart cadaver is the body of a dead person that has been connected to a medical ventilator. This will keep the organs of the dead body, including the heart, functioning and alive for a few days. Such a body still functions physically, but the person it belonged to is dead by the law and medicine's definition because there is no longer any conscious brain function possible.


== Care ==
The procedure for caring for a beating heart cadaver is the same as caring for a normal patient. The body must be monitored at all times, and if necessary, ""life saving"" procedures must be taken. Since the brain does not work, the hormone levels and blood pressure must be controlled by doctors to keep the organs alive. Measures must be taken to prevent infection and maintain normal tissue oxygenation.


== Organ recovery ==
A beating heart cadaver is kept alive in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted. Surgeons will remove the organs, one after the other, and give them to their patients.  The entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours.  This process was formerly known as an ""Organ Harvest"", but the name has since changed to the milder ""Organ Recovery.""  Many organs can be used, and many lives can be saved by one body.  The bodies are generally organ donors, who have agreed beforehand to donate their organs. Some donated organs are taken from non-heart-beating donors. Organs from brain deaths, however, have a better success rate, and currently most organ donation is from these deaths.


== Social issues ==
A beating heart cadaver is often disturbing and confusing. Because the heart is beating and the body is warm, people may have difficulty believing it is dead.  Families often like to see the body once it has been removed from the machines and put to rest.

Interventional Radiology,"Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin (for example an injection) or carried out with the least damage by x-rays, sonography, and so on.
Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases.",0

Crate,"A crate is a type of container often used in shipping. It can be made of wood, but crates made to carry bottles are often plastic. Steel and aluminium crates are also used.


== History ==
The word crate comes from the word: Latin: cratis.
The earliest packaging materials were made of wood and wood fiber. The first crates used to transport anything were hampers or baskets. They were made of twigs, strips of wood, roots, and reeds. Whatever was available that could be woven into a container. Baskets were used to hold and transport food and goods. Later glass and ceramic jugs were protected by baskets.
The first documented reference to a shipping crate in the United States is in a 1930 handbook, Technical Bulletin No. 171 written by C. A. Plaskett for the US Department of Agriculture. His writing implies that crates were defined before that time. C. A. Plaskett was known for his extensive testing and defining of various components of transport packaging.


== Construction ==
While both can be used for shipping, a crate is different from a box. A crate has a frame while a box generally does not. Crates are rigid containers built for the purpose of protecting the contents. Crates can be made of wood, plastic, metal or other materials. Crates usually need to be designed to exactly fit what it is they are protecting. Reusing a crate that does not fit the contents can waste space and harm the contents.

Still life,"A still life is a work of art, most often a painting. In a still life, objects like flowers, fruit, or glasses are arranged in a certain way, and then painted. Most still lifes are of inanimate objects manmade or natural.Still life painting has been popular since the 17th century, when Dutch painters like Adriaen Coorte raised it to a fine art. However, the idea is old: examples can be found in antiquity. With a still life, the artist can focus more on composition and arrangement than with other forms of painting, such as landscape painting or portraiture.",0
Bushfire,"A bushfire is a wildfire that happens mostly in the Australian bush. Bush is the word for scrub, woodland or grassland of Australia and New Zealand. In south east and south west of Australia, bushfires are most common in the summer and early autumn. In the north of Australia, bushfires usually happen during winter which is the dry season. Many Australian plants burn easily. Eucalyptus trees have a high oil content which makes them burn. Over the last 40 years, Australian bushfires have cost around 2.5 billion Australian dollars. In the same period, Australian bushfires caused the death of around 250 people and the destruction of 4,554 homes.But these figures do not include the 173 people who died and the 2000 homes destroyed in the 2009 Victorian bushfires. They can also kill wildlife including rare koalas.

Wash copper,"A wash copper, copper boiler or simply copper is a wash house boiler, generally made of galvanised iron, though the best sorts are made of copper. In the inter-war years they came in two types. The first is built into a brickwork furnace and was found in older houses. The second was the free-standing or portable type, it had an enamelled metal exterior that supported the inner can or copper. The bottom part was adapted to hold a gas burner, a high pressure oil or an ordinary wood or coal fire. Superior models could have a drawing-off tap, and a steam-escape pipe that led into the flue.

It was used for domestic laundry. Linen and cotton were placed in the copper and were boiled to whiten them. Clothes were agitated within the copper with a washing dolly, a vertical stick with either a metal cone or short wooden legs on it. After washing, the laundry was lifted out of the boiling water using the washing dolly or a similar device, and placed on a strainer resting on a laundry tub or similar container to capture the wash water and begin the drying and cooling process. The laundry was then dried with a mangle and then line-dried.  
Coppers could also be used in cooking, used to boil puddings such as a traditional Christmas pudding.  
Meticulous care was taken to avoid rust, and grease. In cases of the latter it could be cleaned with paraffin or soft soap. Water was always put in the copper before it was lit. In the case of solid fuel, a small shovel of hot coals would be brought from the main kitchen fire and coke shovelled on top.

== A ==

Absolute electrode potentialIn electrochemistry, according to an IUPAC definition, is the electrode potential of a metal measured with respect to a universal reference system (without any additional metal–solution interface).
Absolute pressureis zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an absolute scale, so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.
Absolute zeroThe lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value, taken as 0. Absolute zero is the point at which the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion. The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as −273.15° on the Celsius scale (International System of Units), which equals −459.67° on the Fahrenheit scale (United States customary units or Imperial units). The corresponding Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition.
AbsorbanceAbsorbance or decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material, and spectral absorbance or spectral decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted spectral radiant power through a material.
AC powerElectric power delivered by alternating current; common household power is AC.
AccelerationThe rate at which the velocity of a body changes with time, and the direction in which that change is acting.
AcidA molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron (proton or hydrogen ion H+), or, alternatively, capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair (a Lewis acid).

Active transportIn cellular biology, active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration—against the concentration gradient. Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: primary active transport that uses ATP, and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient. An example of active transport in human physiology is the uptake of glucose in the intestines.
ActuatorA device that accepts 2 inputs (control signal, energy source) and outputs kinetic energy in the form of physical movement (linear, rotary, or oscillatory). The control signal input specifies which motion should be taken. The energy source input is typically either an electric current, hydraulic pressure, or pneumatic pressure. An actuator can be the final element of a control loop
Adenosine triphosphateA complex organic chemical that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells, e.g. muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, chemical synthesis. Found in all forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the ""molecular unit of currency"" of intracellular energy transfer.
AdhesionThe tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another (cohesion refers to the tendency of similar or identical particles/surfaces to cling to one another).
Adiabatic processA process where no heat energy is lost to outside space.
Adiabatic wallA barrier through which heat energy cannot pass.
Aerobic digestionA process in sewage treatment designed to reduce the volume of sewage sludge and make it suitable for subsequent use.

Agricultural engineeringThe profession of designing machinery, processes, and systems for use in agriculture.
AlbedoA measure of the fraction of light reflected from an astronomical body or other object.
AlkaneAn alkane, or paraffin (a historical name that also has other meanings), is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon. In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon–carbon bonds are single.
AlkeneAn unsaturated hydrocarbon that contains at least one carbon–carbon double bond. The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably.
Alkyneis an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon—carbon triple bond. The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula CnH2n−2.
Alloyis a combination of metals or of a metal and another element. Alloys are defined by a metallic bonding character.
Alpha particleAlpha particles consist of two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle identical to a helium-4 nucleus. They are generally produced in the process of alpha decay, but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the Greek alphabet, α.
Alternating currentElectrical current that regularly reverses direction.
Alternative hypothesisIn statistical hypothesis testing,
the alternative hypothesis (or maintained hypothesis or research hypothesis) and the null hypothesis are the two rival hypotheses which are compared by a statistical hypothesis test. In the domain of science two rival hypotheses can be compared by explanatory power and predictive power.
AmmeterAn instrument that measures current.
Amino acidsare organic compounds containing amine (–NH2) and carboxyl (–COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways.
Amorphous solidAn amorphous (from the Greek a, without, morphé, shape, form) or non-crystalline solid is a solid that lacks the long-range order that is characteristic of a crystal.
AmpereThe SI unit of current flow, one coulomb per second.
AmphoterismIn chemistry, an amphoteric compound is a molecule or ion that can react both as an acid as well as a base. Many metals (such as copper, zinc, tin, lead, aluminium, and beryllium) form amphoteric oxides or hydroxides. Amphoterism depends on the oxidation states of the oxide. Al2O3 is an example of an amphoteric oxide.
AmplifierA device that replicates a signal with increased power.
AmplitudeThe amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude, which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude.
Anaerobic digestionis a collection of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to manage waste or to produce fuels. Much of the fermentation used industrially to produce food and drink products, as well as home fermentation, uses anaerobic digestion.
Angular accelerationis the rate of change of angular velocity. In three dimensions, it is a pseudovector. In SI units, it is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s2), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (α).
Angular momentumIn physics, angular momentum (rarely, moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity—the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque.
Angular velocityIn physics, the angular velocity of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its angular displacement relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, radians per second in SI units, and is usually represented by the symbol omega (ω, sometimes Ω). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.
Anionis an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged).
Annealing (metallurgy)A heat treatment process that relieves internal stresses.
AnnihilationIn particle physics, annihilation is the process that occurs when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle to produce other particles, such as an electron colliding with a positron to produce two photons. The total energy and momentum of the initial pair are conserved in the process and distributed among a set of other particles in the final state. Antiparticles have exactly opposite additive quantum numbers from particles, so the sums of all quantum numbers of such an original pair are zero. Hence, any set of particles may be produced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are obeyed.
AnodeThe electrode at which current enters a device such as an electrochemical cell or vacuum tube.
ANSIThe American National Standards Institute is a private non-profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.
Anti-gravityAnti-gravity (also known as non-gravitational field) is a theory of creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity. It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift.
Applied engineeringis the field concerned with the application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new product designs, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization. Applied-engineering degreed programs typically include instruction in basic engineering principles, project management, industrial processes, production and operations management, systems integration and control, quality control, and statistics.
Applied mathematicsMathematics used for solutions of practical problems, as opposed to pure mathematics.
Arc lengthArc length is the distance between two points along a section of a curve. Determining the length of an irregular arc segment is also called rectification of a curve. The advent of infinitesimal calculus led to a general formula that provides closed-form solutions in some cases.
Archimedes' principlestates that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces and acts in the upward direction at the center of mass of the displaced fluid. Archimedes' principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse
Area moment of inertiaThe 2nd moment of area, also known as moment of inertia of plane area, area moment of inertia, or second area moment, is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The second moment of area is typically denoted with either an 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
  
 for an axis that lies in the plane or with a 
  
    
      
        J
      
    
    {\displaystyle J}
  
 for an axis perpendicular to the plane. In both cases, it is calculated with a multiple integral over the object in question. Its dimension is L (length) to the fourth power. Its unit of dimension when working with the International System of Units is meters to the fourth power, m4.
Arithmetic meanIn mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean or simply the mean or average when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection.
Arithmetic progressionIn mathematics, an arithmetic progression (AP) or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. Difference here means the second minus the first. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.
Aromatic hydrocarbonAn aromatic hydrocarbon or arene (or sometimes aryl hydrocarbon) is a hydrocarbon with sigma bonds and delocalized pi electrons between carbon atoms forming a circle. In contrast, aliphatic hydrocarbons lack this delocalization. The term aromatic was assigned before the physical mechanism determining aromaticity was discovered; the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, benzene. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be monocyclic (MAH) or polycyclic (PAH).
Arrhenius equationThe Arrhenius equation is a formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates. The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff who had noted in 1884 that Van 't Hoff's equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. This equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula. Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship.: 188  It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions. The Eyring equation, developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy.
Artificial intelligence(AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"".
Assembly languageA computer programming language where most statements correspond to one or a few machine op-codes.
Atomic orbitalIn atomic theory and quantum mechanics, an atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of either one electron or a pair of electrons in an atom. This function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atom's nucleus. The term atomic orbital may also refer to the physical region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present, as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital.
Atomic packing factorThe percentage of the volume filled with atomic mass in a crystal formation.
Audio frequencyAn audio frequency (abbreviation: AF), or audible frequency is characterized as a periodic vibration whose frequency is audible to the average human. The SI unit of audio frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is the property of sound that most determines pitch.
AustenitizationAustenitization means to heat iron, iron-based metal, or steel to a temperature at which it changes crystal structure from ferrite to austenite. The more open structure of the austenite is then able to absorb carbon from the iron-carbides in carbon steel. An incomplete initial austenitization can leave undissolved carbides in the matrix. For some irons, iron-based metals, and steels, the presence of carbides may occur during the austenitization step. The term commonly used for this is two-phase austenitization.
Automationis the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimum human assistance. Automation or automatic control is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention. Some processes have been completely automated.
Autonomous vehicleA vehicle capable of driving from one point to another without input from a human operator.
Azimuthal quantum numberThe azimuthal quantum number is a quantum number for an atomic orbital that determines its orbital angular momentum and describes the shape of the orbital. The azimuthal quantum number is the second of a set of quantum numbers which describe the unique quantum state of an electron (the others being the principal quantum number, following spectroscopic notation, the magnetic quantum number, and the spin quantum number). It is also known as the orbital angular momentum quantum number, orbital quantum number or second quantum number, and is symbolized as ℓ.

Beer–Lambert lawThe Beer–Lambert law, also known as Beer's law, the Lambert–Beer law, or the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law relates the attenuation of light to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling. The law is commonly applied to chemical analysis measurements and used in understanding attenuation in physical optics, for photons, neutrons, or rarefied gases. In mathematical physics, this law arises as a solution of the BGK equation.
BeltA closed loop of flexible material used to transmit mechanical power from one pulley to another.
Belt frictionDescribes the friction forces between a belt and a surface, such as a belt wrapped around a bollard. When one end of the belt is being pulled only part of this force is transmitted to the other end wrapped about a surface. The friction force increases with the amount of wrap about a surface and makes it so the tension in the belt can be different at both ends of the belt. Belt friction can be modeled by the Belt friction equation.
BendingIn applied mechanics, bending (also known as flexure) characterizes the behavior of a slender structural element subjected to an external load applied perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the element. The structural element is assumed to be such that at least one of its dimensions is a small fraction, typically 1/10 or less, of the other two.Bending momentIn solid mechanics, a bending moment is the reaction induced in a structural element when an external force or moment is applied to the element, causing the element to bend.
 The most common or simplest structural element subjected to bending moments is the beam.
Benefit–cost analysisCost–benefit analysis (CBA), sometimes called benefit costs analysis (BCA), is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives (for example in transactions, activities, functional business requirements); it is used to determine options that provide the best approach to achieve benefits while preserving savings. It may be used to compare potential (or completed) courses of actions; or estimate (or evaluate) the value against costs of a single decision, project, or policy.

. It is named after Jacob Bernoulli who discussed it in 1695. Bernoulli equations are special because they are nonlinear differential equations with known exact solutions. A famous special case of the Bernoulli equation is the logistic differential equation.
Bernoulli's equationAn equation for relating several measurements within a fluid flow, such as velocity, pressure, and potential energy.
Bernoulli's principleIn fluid dynamics, Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.: Ch.3 : 156–164, § 3.5  The principle is named after Daniel Bernoulli who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738. Although Bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases, it was Leonhard Euler who derived Bernoulli's equation in its usual form in 1752. The principle is only applicable for isentropic flows: when the effects of irreversible processes (like turbulence) and non-adiabatic processes (e.g. heat radiation) are small and can be neglected.
Beta particlealso called beta ray or beta radiation (symbol β), is a high-energy, high-speed electron or positron emitted by the radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus during the process of beta decay. There are two forms of beta decay, β− decay and β+ decay, which produce electrons and positrons respectively.

Binomial distributionIn probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own boolean-valued outcome: a random variable containing a single bit of information: success/yes/true/one (with probability p) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability q=1 − p).
A single success-failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment and a sequence of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process; for a single trial, i.e., n=1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular binomial test of statistical significance.
BiocatalysisBiocatalysis refers to the use of living (biological) systems or their parts to speed up (catalyze) chemical reactions. In biocatalytic processes, natural catalysts, such as enzymes, perform chemical transformations on organic compounds. Both enzymes that have been more or less isolated and enzymes still residing inside living cells are employed for this task. The modern usage of biotechnologically produced and possibly modified enzymes for organic synthesis is termed chemoenzymatic synthesis; the reactions performed are chemoenzymatic reactions.
Biomedical engineeringBiomedical engineering (BME) or medical engineering is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes (e.g. diagnostic or therapeutic). This field seeks to close the gap between engineering and medicine, combining the design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance health care treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy.
BiomimeticBiomimetics or biomimicry is the imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems.
BionicsThe application of biological methods to engineering systems.
Biophysicsis an interdisciplinary science that applies approaches and methods traditionally used in physics to study biological phenomena. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, molecular biology, physical chemistry, physiology, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics and systems biology.
Biot numberThe Biot number (Bi) is a dimensionless quantity used in heat transfer calculations. It is named after the eighteenth century French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774–1862), and gives a simple index of the ratio of the heat transfer resistances inside of and at the surface of a body. This ratio determines whether or not the temperatures inside a body will vary significantly in space, while the body heats or cools over time, from a thermal gradient applied to its surface.
Block and tackleA system of pulleys and a rope threaded between them, used to lift or pull heavy loads.
Body forceis a force that acts throughout the volume of a body. Forces due to gravity, electric fields and magnetic fields are examples of body forces. Body forces contrast with contact forces or surface forces which are exerted to the surface of an object.
Boileris a closed vessel in which fluid (generally water) is heated. The fluid does not necessarily boil. The heated or vaporized fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications, including water heating, central heating, boiler-based power generation, cooking, and sanitation.
Boiling pointThe boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor.
Boiling-point elevationBoiling-point elevation describes the phenomenon that the boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) will be higher when another compound is added, meaning that a solution has a higher boiling point than a pure solvent. This happens whenever a non-volatile solute, such as a salt, is added to a pure solvent, such as water. The boiling point can be measured accurately using an ebullioscope.
Boltzmann constantThe Boltzmann constant (kB or k) is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas and occurs in Planck's law of black-body radiation and in Boltzmann's entropy formula. It was introduced by Max Planck, but named after Ludwig Boltzmann.

It is the gas constant R divided by the Avogadro constant NA:

BosonIn quantum mechanics, a boson (, ) is a particle that follows Bose–Einstein statistics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of Indian physicist and professor of physics at University of Calcutta and at University of Dhaka, Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Albert Einstein, Bose–Einstein statistics—which theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles.
Boyle's lawBoyle's law (sometimes referred to as the Boyle–Mariotte law, or Mariotte's law) is an experimental gas law that describes how the pressure of a gas tends to increase as the volume of the container decreases. A modern statement of Boyle's law is:
The absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system.
Bravais latticeIn geometry and crystallography, a Bravais lattice, named after Auguste Bravais (1850), is an infinite array (or a finite array, if we consider the edges, obviously) of discrete points generated by a set of discrete translation operations described in three dimensional space by:

where ni are any integers and ai are known as the primitive vectors which lie in different directions (not necessarily mutually perpendicular) and span the lattice. This discrete set of vectors must be closed under vector addition and subtraction. For any choice of position vector R, the lattice looks exactly the same.
Brayton cycleA thermodynamic cycle model for an ideal heat engine, in which heat is added or removed at constant pressure; approximated by a gas turbine.
Break-evenThe break-even point (BEP) in economics, business—and specifically cost accounting—is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal, i.e. ""even"". There is no net loss or gain, and one has ""broken even"", though opportunity costs have been paid and capital has received the risk-adjusted, expected return. In short, all costs that must be paid are paid, and there is neither profit nor loss.
Brewster's angleBrewster's angle (also known as the polarization angle) is an angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection. When unpolarized light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is therefore perfectly polarized. This special angle of incidence is named after the Scottish physicist Sir David Brewster (1781–1868).
BrittlenessA material is brittle if, when subjected to stress, it breaks without significant plastic deformation. Brittle materials absorb relatively little energy prior to fracture, even those of high strength. Breaking is often accompanied by a snapping sound. Brittle materials include most ceramics and glasses (which do not deform plastically) and some polymers, such as PMMA and polystyrene. Many steels become brittle at low temperatures (see ductile–brittle transition temperature), depending on their composition and processing.
BromideAny chemical substance made up of bromine, along with other elements.
Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theoryis an acid–base reaction theory which was proposed independently by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas ",1
Monopoly money,"Monopoly money (symbol: ₩) is a type of play money used in the board game Monopoly. It is different from most currencies, including the American currency or British currency upon which it is based, in that it is smaller, one-sided, and does not have different imagery for each denomination.


== Format ==
Many variations of Monopoly exist, with many types of money representing various currencies. In the more ""standard"" versions of the game, Monopoly money consists entirely of notes. Monopoly notes come in the following colors:

₩1 - White
₩2 - Yellow (available in Monopoly Junior)
₩3 - Blue (available in Monopoly Junior)
₩4 - Green (available in Monopoly Junior)
₩5 - Pink
₩10 - Yellow (classic) or blue (recent editions)
₩20 - Green
₩50 - Blue (classic) or purple (recent editions)
₩100 - Red (early editions) or beige
₩500 - Gold (classic) or orange (recent editions)
₩1,000 (available only in Monopoly: The Mega Edition) - Purple (original) or yellow (recent editions)
The modern Monopoly game has its Monopoly money denominated in ₩1, ₩5, ₩10, ₩20, ₩50, ₩100, ₩500, and (in some editions) ₩1,000, with all but the last two paralleling the denominations in circulation in the United States. (The U.S. $500 bill and U.S. $1000 bill were withdrawn in 1969). Monopoly does not include a two-dollar bill; however, Monopoly Junior did include the two in addition to three and four denominations (which do not exist in U.S. currency) for many years. (Monopoly Junior later simplified its system to include only one-dollar bills.)
Fans have designed unofficial ₩1,000 Monopoly bills for longer games and made them available online.
Special editions and spinoffs (e.g. Monopoly Deal) may use larger denominations. 
Since 2008, Monopoly games use a Monopoly-specific currency symbol ""₩"" of a double struck-through capital letter M, similar to the Won sign (₩) flipped upside-down.


== As a phrase ==
""Monopoly money"" is also a derisive term used in multiple senses. The most common is by countries that have traditionally had monochromatic currency banknotes (such as the United States) to refer to countries that have colorful banknotes (such as Canada). This has been used in places such as the ""Weird Al"" Yankovic song ""Canadian Idiot"".
It can also be used as a derisive term to refer to money not really worth anything, or at least not being used as if it is worth anything.

Dive resort,"Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism.
Motivations to travel for scuba diving are complex and may vary considerably during the diver's development and experience. Participation can vary from once off to multiple dedicated trips per year over several decades. The popular destinations fall into several groups, including tropical reefs, shipwrecks and cave systems, each frequented by its own group of enthusiasts, with some overlap. Temperate and inland open water reef sites are generally dived by people who live relatively nearby.
The industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, safety and convenience by way of dive charter services and guide services on dives. Customer satisfaction is largely dependent on the quality of services provided, and personal communication has a strong influence on the popularity of specific service providers in a region.
Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers. Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs so that the industry can continue to develop sustainably.
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity, requiring significant capital outlay to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large capital expense, with high running costs. There are also health and safety aspects for the operator and the customer. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money. Economic sustainability is affected by environmental awareness and conservation, service delivery and customer satisfaction, and sustainable business management. Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, declarations of medical fitness to dive, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.


== History ==

The history of scuba diving tourism is linked to the history of scuba equipment development and availability, and to the development of training systems that opened up the activity to sufficient numbers to support the industry. Key equipment developments include swimfins, which give the diver underwater mobility and free the hands for other functions, the diving mask, which provides underwater vision, the open circuit regulator, a simple and reliable breathing gas source, the buoyancy compensator, which allows the diver to swim comfortably above the bottom, and float at the surface, wetsuit, a simple and easy to use protection from moderately cold water, submersible pressure gauge, allowing easy monitoring of remaining breathing gas, dive computers,  and nitrox breathing gas, both of which allowed longer dives without decompression.
The growth of the diving industry in a region tends to follow a logistic curve, with a slow start and mostly established, experienced divers with relatively high skill levels exploring a new area where there is little supporting infrastructure. As the area becomes popular, the infrastructure develops and the growth accelerates until it is limited by carrying capacity is approached. By this time the main diver demography has shifted towards the inexperienced and often uncertified diver, with low skill levels and a greater tendency to damage the environment  due to ignorance and lack of basic diving skills. Beyond this stage the situation may stabilise if managed well, or if not, the deterioration in value to the tourist may cause a reduction in popularity and a loss of trade.
Too much competition for customers amongst a large number of diving service providers in a region can lead to low profit margins and pressure on struggling companies to cut costs by following unsustainable diving practices and providing substandard equipment. A reduction in numbers may lead to more cooperation between the remaining companies, and a greater willingness to follow sustainable practices.
The shape of the curve will vary depending on the region.  Areas with more resilient ecologies may see larger numbers while remaining viable, while areas with sensitive ecologies may suffer early collapse. Climate change is likely to render many areas more sensitive to diver impact and most will probably have a reduction in carrying capacity based on limits of acceptable change. The sites that remain viable for longer may receive the overflow from sites which suffer ecological collapse, putting them under greater stress as the less competent divers flood areas that were previously less attractive to them.


== Motivation ==

The motivations of scuba divers to travel have been attributed to adventure, learning, escape, social interaction, stature, challenge and excitement, and while these are probably valid for most novice divers and some long term divers, the motivation of long term enthusiasts may be more complex. The development of a recreational diver from novice to experienced diver is usually associated with acquisition and improvement of skills, and is often accompanied by a shift in motivations to dive. Similarly, expectations of the diving experience, satisfaction with the experience available at different dive sites, and attitudes towards the underwater environment will change in divers who continue to dive over the longer term and relatively frequently. The desire to improve and learn for personal growth and the long term satisfaction and fulfilment derived from this learning is common in such divers. This could be an important factor informing the planning and management of diving tourism.


== Destinations ==

Three main classes of recreational diving tourism destinations exist. These are tropical reefs, shipwrecks, and cave systems. Each caters to a different clientele, though there is some overlap. Temperate reefs are less popular as tourist attractions, but can have their own enthusiasts, including short range tourism and incidental dive tourism associated with general tourism in the region. Any exceptional dive site may be visited by expeditionary dive tourists once the attractions are known, though these destinations are generally not serviced by mainstream tourism service providers.


=== Regions where recreational diving is a major tourist industry ===
There are a few regions where international diver tourism is a significant part of the economy They are mostly tropical areas with extensive coral reefs and predictable weather and water conditions, and often have relatively undeveloped industrial economies.

Great Barrier Reef of Australia
The Red Sea
Hurghada is one of the diving destinations on the Red Sea with rich marine biodiversity, good visibility, a variety of dive sites suitable for different skill levels, including historic shipwrecks, and is accessible at all times of the year.
The Caribbean Sea
Indonesia
Thailand
The Coral Triangle of southeast Asia:
The Philippines
Malaysia
Other regions are also popular for diving, but the relative importance of scuba tourism is lower. There are a very large number of dive sites in Europe, and also in parts of the US, reflecting the origins of the activity and a large fraction of the tourists.


=== Tropical coral reefs ===

Tropical coral reefs are popular recreational diving tourism destinations, as they are generally both pleasant and colorful to dive, relatively low in serious hazards, and the water is at a comfortable temperature, so they attract divers of all levels of competence. They are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact.
Regions include:


=== Shipwrecks ===

Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.
Wreck diving may be divided into three categories of differing hazard and skill and certification requirement:

Non-penetration diving (i.e. swimming over the wreck)
Limited penetration diving, within the ""light zone""
Full penetration diving, beyond the ""light zone""
The inherent hazards of wreck diving may be aggravated by local circumstances like depth, layout and condition of the wreck, the silting hazard, and general sea conditions such as visibility, illumination, surge and currents, and water temperature. Training for wreck diving may be marketed as an associated service.


=== Flooded cave systems ===

Cave diving is diving in water-filled caves, which is considered an extreme sport. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, but almost all cave diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave diving and cavern diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified. Cave diving is a specialist aspect of scuba tourism, as the risks are relatively high and the skill requirements are stringent. Cave diving tourism is generally serviced by specialist dive guides and instructors.
Regions include:

The cenotes of the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico.


== Dive resorts ==
A dive resort is a recreational diving service provider which also provides accommodation for clients and their families. They are usually established in places where recreational diving tourism is popular for a large part of the year, particularly if it is a significant part of the local economy.
Dive resorts usually start out small, catering for dive group of about ten divers booked by a single dive shop or agent from a remote area, so the group is often divers who are a social group at their place of origin. This allows the resort to accommodate the needs of that particular group. If the resort becomes popular, it will usually expand and may become the nucleus for development of the area as other service industries form around it.


== Services provided ==
The scuba diving tourism industry provides both tangible and intangible goods and services. The tangible component includes provision of equipment for rental and for sale, while intangibles include education and skill development, dive charter services and guide services on dives. These organisations are called recreational diving service providers, or dive centres. The standard EN 14467 / ISO 24803 specifies performance requirements for the service provider, and covers aspects of diver training and education, guided dives, and equipment rental, but not the supply of breathing gases, as this is usually covered by national legislation. All of these services are considered distinct.


=== Experiences ===
Retail dive centres provide dive charters, which may be shore or boat dived, dive guides and information on the local environment and ecology, and transportation to and from the dive sites, and may also provide accommodation and hospitality services to tourists, or act as their agents for these services.


==== Liveaboards and day boat dives ====

A liveaboard dive boat is a mobile dive resort. The divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat and provide catering and other hotel services. Amenities may vary from basic to luxurious and the cost will be in proportion. In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber.
The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical diver lift platform. Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat.The tender may also be used to fetch divers separated from the main boat, and for shore excursions where there are no docking facilities.
day boat and basic boat dives may be provided through a land based dive resort, a dive shop, or booked directly with the boar operator. Facilities range from catered with multiple dives to basic transport to and from the site. Much depends on the distance to the site and expected sea and weather conditions.
A day boat would generally provide shelter from the weather and spray while in transit, and be used to transport divers to more than one dive-site during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them. Smaller boats are more usually used when the distance to the dive site is short, and only one dive is intended. Facilities are likely to provide sitting space and a place to sore the scuba set and basic gear. It is common for the diver to travel wearing the diving suit. Since the boat needs only a small amount of space for each diver, it can be smaller and faster than larger boats, or be optimised for surf or slipway launches where there are no convenient harbours. Protection from the weather on fast boats is likely to be the diving suit, sometimes with a windbreaker worn over it, and a hat for the sun, but this will depend on weather conditions.


=== Safety ===

Historically, scuba diving was considered a relatively high risk activity, but this perception has been modified by the developments in equipment, training and service provision. Medical support services and local availability of decompression chambers and on-board medical oxygen for first aid has increased, improving the management of diving accidents and reducing the risk of permanent injury. Recompression facilities for treating serious diving injuries are not often available, even in first world countries.
Prudent service providers will check a client's certification cards and log to ensure the diver has been assessed as competent to dive sites similar to those booked, and may require the diver to demonstrate relevant skills in a checkout dive. Where skills are not of a standard required for safe diving, or environmentally responsible diving, the diver may be requested to take part in remedial training.


=== Equipment ===

The dive tourism industry tends to provide rental equipment to travelling divers more than equipment sales and service, but those aspects are considered valuable adjuncts. Scuba equipment is relatively heavy, and some components (scuba cylinders and diving weights) are not economically transportable by air, and may be included in the cost of a dive. Regulators, wet-suits, masks and fins are more personal equipment, and may be brought by the diver or rented, so a fairly large stock and where applicable, range of sizes is necessary to be able to rent equipment to all customers at a given time. Cameras and dive computers are usually owned by the diver, though entry-level examples may be available for hire at some dive centres. Some equipment manufacturers and distributors encourage exclusive provision of their products through financial incentives, and the range of spares and tools for servicing is affected by the range of equipment stocked, so the range of equipment available may be limited.


=== Diver training ===

There is a large market for diver training while on vacation. Most parts of the world do not have desirable local recreational dive sites, and many divers choose to combine training with a vacation to an area of popular dive sites. Sites suitable for entry-level training often differ considerably from sites which feature as highly desirable for scenic dives and high biodiversity, and unskilled beginners are necessarily kept away from deeper sites with more challenging conditions for their own safety and the protection of the often fragile ecosystems. Specialist wreck diving, cave diving and low environmental impact diving courses are usually available where the local sites are associated with requirements for these certifications.
The Universal Referral Program (URP) is a system intended to facilitate completion of training for open water recreational scuba diving students who intend to do their training dives at a place different from the venue for the theory and confined water training. More specifically, it allows inter agency referral - the referral instructor is not necessarily a member of the same certification agency as the initiating instructor.
Refresher training


=== Specialisation training ===
Training in several specialisations, particularly in technical diving, has become popular as tourism adjuncts because of the venue requiring a specific skill set for access to the sites.

Cave diving
Sidemount diving
Rebreather diving
Deep wreck and wreck penetration diving
Other specialisation training is more optional, as the specific certification is not strictly required, such as boat diving, night diving or drift diving, which are specialties with certification in some agencies' training options, but considered an integral part of core skill certification by others.


== Environmental impact ==

During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Since the 1970s diving has changed from an elite activity to a more accessible recreation, marketed to a very wide demographic. To some extent better equipment has been substituted for more rigorous training, and the reduction in perceived risk has shortened minimum training requirements by several training agencies. Training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences.
Scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide, which has increased to about 23 million by 2016 at about one million per year. Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider environmental sustainability, as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the marine environment in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way. Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control, and that damage to reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers.
Diver impact on subtropical, and particularly temperate reefs is less researched than tropical reefs. The perception is that these reefs are less vulnerable than tropical reefs and the sessile species are less vulnerable to diver impact. Diver contact with the bottom is also prevalent on temperate reefs – one of the main forms mentioned is fin contact with the bottom sediment, raising particulate material into the water column and degrading visibility.
Three aspects of responsible diving behaviour have been identified:

Safe diving behaviour, which is largely a matter of competence, use of appropriate equipment for the dive, use of equipment in good working order, staying within the bounds of personal competence and adherence to procedures known to reduce risk.
Good buoyancy control and trim, the ability to remain at a controlled distance from the benthos, and to do so without contacting it. This is a skill often neglected in entry level recreational diver training, but often offered as an extra course, (eg: PADI Peak performance buoyancy), in training systems that have been planned around minimising the duration of individual courses, and where the entry-level training concentrates on providing the minimum skills acceptable for the safety of the diver in the conditions where the training is done. This has convenience advantages to the diver, and financial advantages to the training provider, but as most recreational divers never progress in training beyond entry level, they are often left marginally competent, and may not get enough practice to improve.
Non-contact behaviour, the voluntary avoidance of contact which may damage the environment. This behaviour is only effective if good buoyancy control and trim are available, and it requires situational awareness which may not be sufficiently developed in a novice, particularly in an unfamiliar environment, and using unfamiliar equipment, often exacerbated by the use of a camera, which can distract the diver from detail awareness of their surroundings.
The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types:

The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites,
Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, causing direct physical damage
Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage, which can dislodge loose deposits and accelerate corrosion
Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.


=== Strategies for sustainable use management ===

Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs

Carrying capacity approach. where the number of divers is restricted. This also limits tourism income from the region. Sustainable diver carrying capacity is influenced by factors which vary between sites.
Limits of acceptable change. This model uses quantitative limits on change defined in specific management objectives for a site using an established baseline.
Percentile approach, where capacity is limited by comparison with damage at non-dived control sites
Restricting recreational divers to delimited locations, which usually concentrates divers and damage along diving trails. This creates paths of degraded reef through the more pristine areas, and will cause dissatisfaction as the trail degrades further.
Regulating the type of diving equipment allowed, generally accessories which are thought to increase reef contacts, such as gloves and cameras. These restrictions are understandably unpopular with photographers, and may be applied to both divers who manage to avoid contact and those who do not.
Changing the methods by which the industry provides services. Closer supervision and intervention by dive guides can reduce diver contact rates where the divers are sufficiently skilled to modify their behaviour during the dive. A pre-dive briefing on responsible behaviour, regulations and environmental values can reduce the rate of diver impacts where the divers are sufficiently competent to avoid contact. More effective interventions occur when the number of divers per guide is low.
Encouraging or enforcing competence of divers in low impact diving as a precondition for diving in sensitive areas. This has been identified as an effective way of reducing diver contact.


== Economics ==
Scuba diving is an equipment intensive activity. Significant capital outlay is required to establish a retail outlet with the expected range of equipment and filling facilities. Dive boats are a large to very large capital expense, and running costs and crew salaries can be considerable. There are also health and safety aspects to be considered, both for the operator and the customer, as high pressure filling equipment is used to provide breathing air which will be used in a hostile environment. Adequate quality control is necessary to avoid providing a harmful product. The cost of qualifying as a diving instructor is significant in time and money, and annual registration fees are a required.


=== Sustainability ===
Three factors have been identified as important in economic sustainability:

Environmental awareness and conservation: The regions that are the most popular destinations for most recreational diver tourism are also those with the most fragile and vulnerable ecosystems. Divers have a tendency to choose their destinations based on reputation for a quality experience, which is largely related to the state of the ecosystem. Word gets around when a region's dive sites are deteriorating, and this adversely affects bookings and income. For sustainable business over the long term, the local service providers and communities need to ensure that the impact on the ecology is sustainable. To a large extent this involves ensuring that clients are competent to dive the local sites without damaging delicate organisms, which often requires a level of skill greater than the diver can sustain by diving only a few times a year.
Service delivery and customer satisfaction: Depending  on location, it may be difficult or impossible to consistently provide a satisfactory dive experience, as weather and sea conditions may not be predictable over the longer term. Consequently the type of diving tourism can vary considerably by region, with service providers in some places only able to confirm bookings a few days in advance, while in others a cancellation is the exception, and this may vary seasonally. Customer satisfaction is linked to expectations, and providers catering to a repeat market may be less likely to take the boat out on a day when conditions are forecast to be marginal by local standards.
Sustainable business management. (Return on investment, maintaining reputation, maintaining equipment, compliance with safety requirements etc)


=== Economic risks ===

International risks to the diving tourism industry include terrorism, economic recessions and global disease epidemics. Domestic risks within the borders of specific countries may include increased crime rates, and political instability.
Environmental degradation, partly due to the impact of recreational diving on the environment, where pollution and direct damage by divers have been recorded, and the effects of natural disasters and climate change such as increased water temperature causing coral bleaching are threatening the industry, as divers are less inclined to visit areas where these problems have been reported. Overexploitation by fishing and illegal extraction have led to some sites being closed and permit systems introduced, sometimes limiting the numbers of divers that may visit an area in a given time interval.
The global economic downturn has reduced spending on expensive leisure activities, reducing the income of tourism destinations, including scuba diving charters and diving schools, and political instability deters visitors to a region
Liability issues can be managed by the use of waivers, adherence to industry best standards, and public liability insurance.
A large proportion of divers visiting tropical coral reef destinations are international travellers – circumstances that may induce them not to travel, or not to visit a particular region can have a strong influence on the viability of a diving operation. A study on diving tourism in East Africa showed that the major environmental risks  for that region are overfishing and marine pollution. The economic risks are mainly price inflation and recessions, the social risks include global disease epidemics and international crime, and political instability and onerous visa regulations are the major political risks.


== Demographics ==

Recreational diving tourists appear to be male-dominated, with an average age in the mid thirties, a college education, and higher than average income, which is in keeping with the relatively high costs of equipment, training and travel.
The general population of American scuba diving participants are on average wealthier and better educated than the general population, and have a higher participation than average in individual and team sports, and extreme sports. Nearly 46% participate in running or jogging, and 36% swim for fitness. The DAN medical emergency line and fatality and injury monitoring program have reported that some divers get injured as a consequence of inadequate physical fitness.
A study to identify differences between local scuba divers and visitors in Florida showed that visitors had less certification and experience but spent more on scuba, compared to local resident divers. Cluster analysis identified four groups of scuba divers:

Fun-seeking belongers: Divers with a strong affiliation for group belonging, looking for fun and excitement, enjoyed diving in varied locations, enjoyed stimulating encounters and considered bonding with other divers important. They self-identified as belonging to the scuba community and sought to associate with other divers with similar attitudes. They tended to have more diving experience and spent more on scuba activities. Mostly males, and the majority unmarried.
Actualizers: Divers focused on challenge, self-recognition, and self-esteem values, likely to consider certification important and consider that overcoming the challenges is important to their self-image. Represented by more females than other groups, and lower income and expenditure on scuba activities.
Inner-circles: People who perceived diving as an opportunity to make new friends, and spend time with family and friends. Image as a diver relatively unimportant, and not driven to be part of the scuba diving community. Mostly married, male, well-educated, with less diving experience than average.
Moderates: Divers more likely to do a single dive in a day, and less focused on the characteristics typical of the other groups.


== Legal risk and liability ==
Participation in recreational diving implies acceptance of the inherent risks of the activity. Diver training includes training in procedures known to reduce these risks to a level considered acceptable by the certification agency, and issue of certification implies that the agency accepts that the instructor has assessed the diver to be sufficiently competent in these skills at the time of assessment and to be sufficiently informed to accept the asso",1
Swan band,"Swan bands are a characteristic of the spectra of carbon stars, comets and of burning hydrocarbon fuels. They are named for the Scottish physicist William Swan, who first studied the spectral analysis of radical diatomic carbon (C2) in 1856.
Swan bands consist of several sequences of vibrational bands scattered throughout the visible spectrum.

Ghost town,"A ghost town is a name for a city or town in which no one lives anymore. It can happen because of economical reasons (for instance, a town of gold miners who cannot find gold anymore), a natural disaster (a flood, a very long drought) or even a man-made disaster (for example, the nuclear fallout that emptied the town of Prypiat, Ukraine). 
Some ghost towns are kept intact as tourist attractions. For example Craco, in the Italian region of Basilicata, is a destination for tourists and pilgrims, as well as a famous movie set for movies like The Passion of the Christ by Mel Gibson and Quantum of Solace by Marc Forster.",0
Chimney crane,"Chimney cranes, also known as fireplace cranes and pot cranes, are a feature of the homes of the American Colonial period and 18/19th century of Western Europe. Although the chimney crane may be thought by some to be a Yankee invention, it was common in both British and American houses of the era. The purpose of the crane is to allow a cooking pot to be swung away from the fire, preventing burn injuries to the cook as well as regulating temperature of the pot.  The chimney crane is an important step in open hearth cooking as it helped save lives and allowed cooks to be more creative.
For centuries before the iron crane was introduced, colonial and European fireplaces used a chain that hung from first a green wooden chimney lug pole then a fixed iron pole directly over the fire. The chimney crane, by contrast, was bolted to the wall and was hinged in order to swing easily.  Numerous pots, kettles and other items could be hung on the crane to simmer and cook over the flames.

Credit union,"A credit union is a cooperative financial institution that is owned and controlled by its members. Credit unions differ from banks and other financial institutions in that the members who have accounts in the credit union are the owners of the credit union - there are no external shareholders. Profits from the operations of a credit union are distributed to members in the form of dividends.
The basic services of a credit union are to offer savings accounts and loans to members.",0
Fire pit,"A fire pit or a fire hole can vary from a pit dug in the ground to an elaborate gas burning structure of stone, brick, and metal. The defining feature of fire pits is that they are designed to contain fire and prevent it from spreading.
Certain contemporary fire pit styles include a fire bowl that can either be set in the ground or elevated on legs.


== Contemporary types ==

Pre-made fire pits are the most common form of fire pits and can be purchased from a store. These are commonly made of pre-cast concrete or metal or a combination of metal table and stone. They burn usually natural gas, propane (LP) or bio ethanol. Wood-burning fire pits made of metal are also quite common but are under increasing scrutiny due to fire bans and air particulate emissions.
Natural gas and propane burners in these sorts of pre-fabricated vessels are certified under ANSI (American), CSA (Canadian), and CE (European) standards. Unregulated and uncertified fire pit burners are increasingly being scrutinized by regulatory authorities and being denied permits.  Fire pits have recommended clearance to combustibles and require at least 6 feet (1.8 m) above the flame and 16 inch (40 cm) circumference from the exterior perimeter of the vessel.
Essentially, a fire pit needs only a hole that can safely contain a fire. This can be as simple as a hole dug in the ground, or as complex as a holed-out brick or rock pillar. A wood-burning fire pit should be located at least ten feet (three meters) away from structures for safety. Use of a fire pit in adverse conditions should be avoided, and basic fire safety precautions apply.


== Dakota fire pit ==

The Dakota fire pit is an efficient, simple fire design that produces little to no smoke. Two small holes are dug in the ground: one for the firewood and the other to provide a draft of air. Small twigs are packed into the fire hole and readily combustible material is set on top and lit. The fire burns from the top downward, drawing a steady, laminar stream of fresh air from the air hole as it burns. Because the air passes freely around the fuel, near complete combustion is achieved, the result being a fire that burns strongly and brightly and with little or no seen smoke. The Dakota fire pit is a tactical fire used by the United States military as the flame produces a low light signature, reduced smoke, and is easier to ignite under strong wind conditions.
This style of fire pit is said to get its name from the Dakota people, who used it while hunting bison herds on the Great Plains. As well as resisting the strong winds of that area, the design also reduced the risk of causing a prairie fire.


== Fire pits in history ==
Many cultures, particularly nomadic ones, would cut the turf above the fire-pit in a turf cutting ceremony, replacing the turf afterwards to hide any evidence of the fire. The youth organization Woodcraft Folk also does this.


== Archaeological significance ==
The remains of fire pits preserve information about past cultures. Radiocarbon dating from charcoal found in old fire pits can estimate when regions were first populated or when civilizations died out. Bones and seeds found in fire pits indicate the diet of that area.
In archaeological terms fire pits are referred to as features because they can be seen and recorded as part of the site but cannot be moved without being destroyed.


== Fire ring ==

A fire ring is a construction or device used to contain campfires and prevent them from spreading and turning into wildfires.
A fire ring is designed to contain a fire that is built directly upon the ground, such as a campfire. Fire rings have no bottom, and are simply circles made of forged metal, stones, concrete, etc. which surround and contain a fire. Manufactured steel fire rings are available in various sizes to suit every need.
When a fire is to be built somewhere such as on a patio or in a backyard, a fire pit or outdoor fireplace may be better used instead. These are designed to contain the entire fire instead of just keeping it in one place.

A fire ring may be nothing more than a short, wide section of metal tube, partially buried in the ground.  Slightly more advanced fire rings may be partially covered with metal bars so that the fire may be used for cooking. These types are seen at many campgrounds.  Fire rings in urban areas, such as on beaches, may be made of poured concrete. Makeshift fire rings can be constructed out of a ring of stones where pre-constructed rings are not available, but care should be taken as some stones can explode when heated due to trapped gas pockets, thermal expansion, or water contained flashing into steam.

Destination management,"A destination management company (DMC) is a professional services company with local knowledge, expertise and resources, working in the design and implementation of events, activities, tours, transportation and program logistics.
There are very few destination management organizations. Management implies control, and rarely does a tourism organisation have control over the destination's resources, such as in the case of the New Zealand government's development of the resort town of Rotorua in the first half of the 20th century. The majority of these entities are regarded as destination marketing organizations.
A DMC provides a ground service based on local knowledge of their given destinations. These services can be transportation, hotel accommodation, restaurants, activities, excursions, conference venues, themed events, gala dinners and logistics, meetings, incentive schemes as well as helping with overcoming language barriers. By acting as purchasing consortia, DMCs can provide preferential rates based on the buying power they have with their preferred suppliers.

Flywheel,"A flywheel is a heavy disk or wheel that is attached to a rotating shaft. Flywheels are used for storage of kinetic energy. The momentum of the flywheel causes it to not change its rotational speed easily. Because of this, flywheels help to keep the shaft rotating at the same speed. This helps when the torque applied to the shaft changes often. Uneven torque can change the speed of rotation. Because the flywheel resists changes in speed, it decreases the effects of uneven torque. Engines which use pistons to provide power usually have uneven torque and use flywheels to fix this problem.
It takes energy to get a wheel (any wheel) to rotate. If there is little friction (good bearings) then it will keep rotating a long time. When energy is needed, it can be taken from the wheel again. So it is a simple mechanical means of storing energy. The amount of energy stored is a function of the weight and the speed of rotation - making a heavier wheel rotate faster takes more energy. Another factor is the radius (size) because the farther from the axis a part of the wheel is, the more energy it takes to make is rotate. These three factors can be represented by M (mass), 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  
 (angular velocity), and R (radius). Combining the two equations below gives

2MR2/4. A fly-wheel is not just any wheel, but specifically designed to store energy. So it should be heavy and/or rotate fast. For example, some buses have a fly-wheel that is used for stopping and starting. When the bus stops (e.g. for a traffic light), the fly-wheel is connected to the wheels, so the rotational energy is transferred to it, so the bus will slow down while the fly-wheel speeds up. Then, when the bus has to start driving again, it is connected again and the energy is transferred back. Of course, you wouldn't want to lug a heavy wheel around on a bus, so it is made of a lighter material that can withstand extremely fast rotation.
