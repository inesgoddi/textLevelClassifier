"======================================================================Quantum Mechanics: The Weird and Wonderful World of the Tiny---------------------------------------------------------Hey there! Are you ready to explore the weird and wonderful world of the tiny? Quantum mechanics is a fascinating field that explores the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. In this text, we'll dive into the basics of quantum mechanics and explain it in a way that's easy to understand for a general audience.What is Quantum Mechanics?-------------------------Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It's based on the principles of wave-particle duality, uncertainty, and the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena. In other words, quantum mechanics helps us understand how the tiny things in our universe behave and interact with each other.The Wave-Particle Duality------------------------One of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is wave-particle duality. This means that particles, like electrons or photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how we observe them. For example, when observed individually, electrons behave like particles, but when observed collectively, they exhibit wave-like behavior.Uncertainty Principle-------------------Another important principle of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle. This states that it's impossible to know certain properties of a particle, like its position and momentum, simultaneously with infinite precision. In other words, the more precisely we try to measure one property, the less precisely we can measure the other.Probabilistic Nature of Phenomena-------------------------------Quantum mechanics also introduces the concept of probability in physical phenomena. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the behavior of particles is described by probabilities rather than definite outcomes. This means that the outcome of a measurement or experiment is uncertain until it's observed, and even then, the outcome is still probabilistic.Applications of Quantum Mechanics-------------------------------Quantum mechanics has many practical applications in our daily lives. For example, it's used in transistors, which are the building blocks of modern electron,",0

Are you ready to explore the weird and wonderful world of the tiny? Quantum mechanics is a fascinating field that delves into the mysterious behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. In this text, we'll take a closer look at the principles of quantum mechanics and how they shape our understanding of the universe.What is Quantum Mechanics?-------------------------Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that seeks to explain the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. At this scale, the rules of classical physics no longer apply, and strange, seemingly magical phenomena occur. Quantum mechanics provides a framework for understanding these phenomena and the underlying principles that govern them.Principles of Quantum Mechanics-----------------------------One of the key principles of quantum mechanics is wave-particle duality. This means that particles, such as electrons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed. For example, an electron can behave like a wave when it's not being observed, but it can also behave like a particle when it's being measured.Another important principle of quantum mechanics is superposition. This means that particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, which is known as a superposition of states. For example, an electron can be in two places at once, or it can have both spin and momentum at the same time.The Observer Effect-------------------One of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics is the observer effect. This means that the act of observing a particle can change its behavior. For example, if an electron is not being observed, it may exhibit wave-like behavior, but as soon as it's observed, it will behave like a particle.This has profound implications for our understanding of reality and challenges our classical understanding of the world. It suggests that the act of observation itself can shape the nature of reality, which is a mind-blowing concept!Quantum Entanglement-------------------Another strange phenomenon in quantum,",0

At this scale, the rules of classical physics no longer apply, and strange and counterintuitive phenomena occur. Quantum mechanics provides a framework for understanding these phenomena and predicting the behavior of particles at the quantum level.The Principles of Quantum Mechanics-------------------------------There are several key principles that underlie quantum mechanics:1. **Wave-particle duality**: Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on how they are observed. This challenges our classical understanding of reality and highlights the strange nature of the quantum world.2. **Uncertainty principle**: It is impossible to know certain properties of a particle, such as its position and momentum, simultaneously with infinite precision. This reflects the inherent uncertainty and indeterminacy of the quantum world.3. **Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, which challenges our classical understanding of reality.4. **Entanglement**: Particles can become ""entangled"" in such a way that their properties are correlated, regardless of the distance between them. This allows for the phenomenon of quantum teleportation and other strange effects.The Quantum World-----------------In the quantum world, particles exhibit strange and counterintuitive behavior. For example, particles can be in multiple places at once, or they can be instantaneously entangled with each other, regardless of distance. This is a far cry from our everyday experience of the world, where objects seem to have definite positions and properties.Quantum,",0

"Facts about the Earth 1) Earth is the third planet from the sun in our solar system. Its name comes from the the old English and Germanic words meaning the ground.
2) Our amazing planet has been around for quite some time. By researching our planets rocks, scientists have calculated the Earth to be around 4.5 billion years old! 3) Like all the planets, Earth orbits (travels around) around the sun. And it does so at some serious speed  around 30 kilometres per second, in fact! It takes 365 days (one year) for the Earth to complete one full orbit. 
4) Have you ever wondered why we have different seasons? Well tell you  its because the Earth is tilted 23.4 degrees on its axis, an imaginary line straight through the middle of the planet form the North Pole to the South Pole. This means that different parts of the globe are tilted towards the sun at different times of the year (or at different times during its orbit).5) Not only does Earth zoom through space, it also spins on its axis. The result? We have daytime and nighttime! As the planet rotates, the side facing the sun receives daylight and the the other is in darkness.
6) People often think of Earth as a gigantic sphere. But, in fact, its shape is more like a squished ball that bulges out at the equator  an imaginary line around the middle of the planet, exactly between the North Pole and the South Pole. 
7) This bulge is caused by the Earths spin and the effect of gravity. Gravity is an invisible force that attracts objects towards each other. Its this force that pulls things towards the Earth and stops us floating off into space!8) The Earths diameter (distance straight through the middle) measures a huge 12,800 kilometres, making it the fifth largest planet in the solar system. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are even bigger!
9) Earth is the only planet in our solar system known to support life. This is because it has two very important things that living creatures need to survive  lots of oxygen and lots of water! Its distance from the sun means its not too hot and not too cold for creatures to live on, too.10) Earths atmosphere is also hugely important for sustaining life. The atmosphere is a huge blanket of gases  mostly oxygen and nitrogen  wrapped around Earth, protecting our planet from the suns strong rays. At the same time, the atmosphere helps keep the Earths temperature comfortable for living beings  and it protects us from meteors, too!

"Did you know? June 23rd is World Female Ranger Day! Come on gang, lets find out about these wonderful wildlife rangers

What is a wildlife ranger?

Wildlife rangers work tirelessly to protect wildlife from extinction. In their native countries, these brave people do everything they can to keep endangered animals like elephants and rhinos safe.

Across the continent of Africa, rangers are kept busy day and night. Working in small teams, they prevent poaching, clear up harmful snares that could harm wildlife, and patrol enormous wild areas.Mens work?

More often than not, wildlife rangers are men. In many countries, women are expected to work in the home (cooking, cleaning, fetching water, and providing for the family). Many women become wives and mothers at a young age, which means that they may not have enough time or freedom, to take part.

Plus, the hard and dangerous tasks of a wildlife ranger mean that the job is frequently seen as unsuitable for women. Ranger training can be a difficult and physically demanding process, which requires lots of skills that women are not traditionally trained in.

As a result, just 11% of wildlife rangers are women.

However, these women make up many successful female anti-poaching teams in many countries around the world, including at least 18 African countries.So, lets meet some of these incredible wildlife-defending women

Nyaradzo Hoto

Nyaradzo is a 29-year-old ranger from the Akashinga Anti-Poaching Unit in Zimbabwe. She joined the unit in 2017, and studies Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the Chinhoyi University of Technology alongside her job!

Before she became a ranger, Nyaradzo was forced to drop out of school and get married. Now, she earns her own money, and was able to purchase her own land and build a house  something many African women cannot afford to do on their own.

Sithabile Munenge

Sithabile is a Community Scout for the National Park Rescue in Zimbabwe. Once a tomato seller, she now protects wildlife and wild spaces within the important Chizarira National Park.

Sithabile says: Usually, men are the first preference to be employed by companies. But now I have the respect of my community, and I will be able to build my childrens future.

All-female teams, like Sithabiles, often succeed in ways that all-male teams do not. For example, they are better at easing local tensions, and often help to strengthen relationships within their communities.As a result, both animals AND people benefit from working with the female wildlife rangers. Plus, the job helps women like Sithabile access education, healthcare, and property  things they may never have got otherwise.

Leitah Mkhabela

Leitah has an incredibly responsible job  she and her fellow rangers are working hard to create a danger-free zone for wildlife, that is safe from poachers and life-threatening snares.Leitahs work with the Black Mamba Anti-Poaching Unit in South Africa has already saved the lives of many endangered animals.

She says: when I started as a Black Mamba, people were scared of the training we went through. People said that this training is for men and we couldnt do it because we are women. But people started to come around once the impact of the female rangers was clear. It has helped women in community to see themselves differently. People have seen how we want to do this and so many women started to support us.

Hopefully, this means that there will be even more female wildlife rangers in the future! Yay!

World Female Ranger Day

Many people dont know about the hard work of these extraordinary rangers, so UK charity How Many Elephants have created a new awareness day: World Female Ranger Day.On June 23rd every year, people will celebrate female wildlife rangers all over the world. There are many more women out there just like Nyaradzo, Sithabile, and Leitah, who are working hard to make a difference  to the animals, wild places, and to their communities too!

The founder of How Many Elephants, adventurer Holly Budge, teamed up with colleague Margot Dempsey to create World Female Ranger Day. Holly got to know many female rangers during her campaigns to save African elephants from illegal poaching. As a result, she knows just how important it is to encourage more women to get involved.

She says: We are looking forward to bringing together female rangers around the world to celebrate their incredible work, identify the challenges they face, and provide them with the support they need through our fundraising and awareness efforts. Amazing!

So hopefully, World Female Ranger Day will help support these wonderful wildlife rangers, and inspire even more women across the world to get involved. Brilliant!

"What is COP26?

First things first  what does COP26 even mean?! Well, COP stands for conference of parties  a meeting that involves lots of different people working towards the same goal.

COP26 is the 26th meeting of members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Its a bit of a mouthful, but all you really need to know is that COP26 is a huge, important meeting all about taking action against climate change.

It began in 1994, when many world leaders became part of the UNFCCC and agreed that their countries would help to combat global warming. Since then, a COP has been held every year so that decision-makers can get together and discuss what to do next.

Where is the meeting?COP26 will take place at the Scottish Events Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, Scotland, and will be the biggest meeting of world leaders that the UK has ever hosted!

Each year, COP takes place in a different country. COP25 was held in Madrid, Spain, in 2019, during which Greta Thunberg gave a now-famous speech. During this meeting, important targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions were agreed.

COP26 was supposed to take place in November 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was delayed by a year. The conference is now happening on the 1st-12th of November 2021.

Who will be at COP26?

Representatives from nearly every country in the world! This includes world leaders like the U.K.s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and President Joe Biden of the U.S.A., along with a whole host of other important people.

Members of the press will attend, to report about the conference on TV, radio and in newspapers. Plus, representatives from over 2,000 NGOs* are usually present, too.*NGOs are non-governmental organisations, such as Action Against Hunger, Greenpeace, and WWF  all have an interest in the outcome of COP26.

What will they talk about? At COP meetings, governments from across the globe agree on targets for the future, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gases and protecting the planet. These decisions affect people all over the globe; they help us all work together to become greener and more sustainable.

Five years ago at COP21 in Paris, every member of the UNFCCC signed the Paris Agreement  an international commitment to tackle climate change. At COP26, members will review whether this agreement is working, and highlight any progress.

In the Paris Agreement, nations agreed that they would:

1. Reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and invest in renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power.

2. Prevent global temperatures from warming by more than 2C, and try to keep the increase as low as 1.5C.

3. Help less-developed countries become more environmentally friendly, by supporting them financially.

4. Review progress on the Agreement every five years.

Why is COP26 important?

COP26 is the most important COP since 2015, when the Paris Agreement was created. It is an opportunity for the world to see what has been achieved since these targets were set  and pay attention to what hasnt.

Hopefully, there will be new decisions on how to cut carbon emissions, and the world will make more progress on combatting climate change.

The after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic will also have an impact on COP26. Many governments are now paying more attention to the environment. As a result, they are hoping to rebuild their economies in a greener and more sustainable way.

Can I get involved? You might not be able to attend COP26, but you can still make your voice heard! There are tonnes of ways to get involved with the UKs Year of Climate Action.

Simply talking about climate change with family and friends can inspire others to learn more about it and why they should care. Or if you want to take your passion one step further, why not write to your MP? You could tell them what YOU think is important, and let them know how passionate you are about saving our planet!

"ELEPHANT IN A WELL!

Villagers in Kerala, India, were awoken by trumpeting one morning in 2017, and discovered a baby elephant trapped in a well. A rescue team used a digger to free him and soon the elephant was able to rejoin his herd, which was waiting nervously nearby. Before disappearing into the forest, the mum raised her trunk to rescuers as if to say thank you!CROCODILE PAL

In 1989, a Costa Rican fisherman named Chito nursed a 5m-long crocodile back to health after fi nding it injured on a riverbank. He named it Pocho. Chito tried to release the croc back into the wild, but Pocho followed him home! The two remained close for the next 20 years  Pocho would even let Chito put his head in his mouth. Yikes!

SUCKED-UP SNAKE!

Over 170 species of snake live in Australia and they often slither into peoples houses. Snake catcher Stuart McKenzie was called to a home in Queensland, Australia, because of a very strange situation  a highly venomous red-bellied black snake had been sucked up into a vacuum cleaner! Luckily, the serpent was uninjured, and Stuart managed to carefully remove it before releasing it back into the wild. Ressssult!LUCKY LION!

When rangers in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, found Naturinda the lion caught in a painful wire snare trap, they treated her wounds and sent her on her way. But two weeks later, they discovered Naturinda up a tree looking very weak. The lion urgently needed more help, so the rangers shot her with an anaesthetic dart and placed a mattress below to cushion her fall from the branches. After giving her more medical care and a tasty antelope to feed on, Naturinda eventually made a full recovery. ESCAPE FROM THE FIRE!

A troop of monkeys became trapped in treetops above Indias Tungabhadra River when heavy rains flooded the region last year. The fi re department tried to rescue them using lifeboats, but the panicked monkeys kept running away. So the clever rescuers constructed a rope bridge secured with boulders. The operation took four days but eventually all 55 monkeys clambered to safety!RESCUE GEAR

Lets talk a look at some of the specialist equipment rescuers might use to help save animals in need!

 Helicopters can airlift heavy animals away for treatment or help rehome them in more suitable areas.

 Experts often use hooks to handle dangerous snakes. This helps to keep their venomous fangs away from the handler.

 Winches can help pull off-road vehicles out of tricky terrain, like bogs and ditches.

 Injured animals can be given immediate medical care in an animal ambulance.

 In Britain during 2019, 186 animals were rescued from the water by the Royal National Lifeboat Association.

"Currently, around half of the worlds population live in cities  but by 2050 theyre set to become even more crowded, with an additional 2.5 billion people!

All these extra inhabitants will need places to live, transport to get around, and energy to power their homes. This will put extra pressure on Earths resources  which is why we need to come up with environmentally-friendly ways to construct buildings, travel and generate power.

Lets take a look at some of the high-tech sustainable solutions being developed by materials company Covestro for the cities of the future


HIGHTECH TRANSPORT

Technology could make travel safer, more sustainable, and more efficient than ever before. Heres how

Self-driving cars

In the future, our cars will be electric and theyll all be able to drive themselves  some of them wont even have steering wheels! How will it work? Well, sensors, radars and cameras will help cars coordinate  theyll whizz and weave past one another like an elegant ballet!  Passengers can daydream while gazing out of the panoramic roof. Front seats swivel round so everyone can socialise. And interactive, animated holographic screens will be built right into car dashboards.

ELECTRIC VEHICLES

Electric vehicles are already going mainstream! In 2017, Nagpur became Indias first city to have an electric transport system. By 2030, the country aims to have 100% electric public transport.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT

Buses of the future will be sleek, smooth and sustainable! Instead of rumbling engines theyll run on high-performance batteries and will be built out of lightweight materials. INTERNET EVERYWHERE

Do you ever have issues with buffering or slow downloads? Well, in the cities of the future, super-fast 5G internet networks will be everywhere, transforming the way we live

Smart street furniture

Everyday urban objects will be smart, just like phones! Streetlights will have sensors so they only switch on when someones near by  saving energy and reducing light pollution. Theyll also measure air pollution and monitor traffic. Bins will notify the council when they need emptying, and parking meters will be automated!  5G transmitters will need to be installed every 500 metres  they could be on lamp posts, waste bins and traffic lights.



HOUSING

Most of the homes that will make up our future cities already exist today. And to solve the climate emergency we need to make these older buildings energy efficient

Innovative insulation

Covestro has come up with a material called cardyon which is made from the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO?).
The innovative CO? technology could be used to make insulation, which would not only reduce CO? in the atmosphere, but prevent future emissions, too. Wow!

 In the USA, up to 90% of existing homes may be under insulated leaking up to 30% of the energy produced.

 Polyurethane insulation can reduce heat loss by up to 80% and reduce energy consumption. Its also thin so people wont lose space.  Pre-fab homes

Many homes of the future will be pre-fabricated  meaning premade. Structures such as walls are created off site, and then slotted together! Covestros PUREWall structures can be put up in half the time of regular buildings, saving energy and money.

Pre-fab homes could be used to house refugees, or after natural disasters. They could also replace the worlds 200 million slums. 

AUGMENTED REALITY (AR)

Super-realistic interactive holographic visuals will appear in our urban environments. Pokmon Go is a popular example of AR today!

Glasses

Using AR glasses, we can find extra information about our environments. Doctors could wear them to help see inside patients! Virtual reality (VR)

VR will be more commonplace, allowing us to immerse ourselves in TV and video games, visit galleries, and travel virtually to different places.



GREEN ENERGY

By 2050, the global demand for electricity is estimated to increase by 57%. So how can we power our future cities cleaner and more efficiently?

Wind power goes big!

Wind turbines are an eco-friendly way of generating electricity  but if they were bigger, they could be even more efficient! Thanks to new strong, lightweight materials, blades can be the length of an entire football field! Wind turbines are an eco-friendly way of generating electricity  but if they were bigger, they could be even more efficient! Thanks to new strong, lightweight materials, blades can be the length of an entire football field! Integrated solar panels on new buildings mean homes can generate their own energy! Solar panels could also be installed on windows or roads.In order to store all this renewable energy, more efficient batteries will be developed that can power our cars, homes and cities. China has already begun installing
 large-scale battery storage facilities.  Experts believe we will be able to power cities with 100% renewable electricity by as early as 2040!
Hi Rebecca! You set up Covestros idea.lab, where scientists come together to solve problems. What are some of the biggest challenges facing the future? 

Definitely climate change and the environment! Right now, the world still relies too much on fossil fuels for our energy, and landfill for our waste. We need to become more environmentally aware, fast! Scientists across the globe, including at Covestro, are working on ways to help.  

What are some recent ideas Covestro has come up with that will help the environment? 

Thanks to new materials, were changing wind turbines and making them much bigger. Larger wind turbines means more energy produced! Were also working on lighter and more efficient solar panels so that one day we could power our aeroplanes and cars with sunlight! And weve got 20 Research & Development projects focused on new ways to recycle plastics.


COVESTRO CHAT!

Covestro manager Rebecca Heil tells us about some of the exciting new ideas that the materials company is working onIs it true you are recycling greenhouse gases?

Yes! Carbon dioxide (CO?) is a gas which is known as being problematic for the climate. But we are working on ways to use it as a raw material. Thats very exciting, because it means we will conserve fossil resources. CO? is already successfully being used in mattresses, sports floors, car parts and even clothing. And the process has the potential to be applied for many other products. This technology could be one
of the big breakthroughs to help make cities of the future more sustainable.

Cool! Can you tell us about more things we can expect to see in the future?

Materials will become lighter and more natural looking, with sweeping curves and rounded shapes. Theyll also become smarter, with in-built electronics. Thanks to 5G, everything from rubbish bins to street lights are expected to become smart. To do this, theyll need to be able to share data using special tiny transmitters. Thats what Covestro is creating at the moment! What about entertainment?

Recently we worked with the Research & Development Team at Sony to create a holographic-like display  similar to the sort of thing youve probably seen in sci-fi movies! It can project floating images within a 360-degree direction while being transparent. This was possible thanks to a special photopolymer film developed by our scientists. 

Wow! What do you like best about your job? 

I love that my work is aimed at improving the planet and peoples lives. Its very meaningful and I get to work with others who also really care about what they do. Working with the latest technology is inspiring, too!

Do you have any advice for kids who want to work in science?

When I was a kid, I thought all scientists wore white coats
and spent their days looking through microscopes. This isnt true at
all  theres so much variety in science. From art to marine biology, science is everywhere! Talk to as many people as you can to find out about the science thats in their lives.Finally, if kids enter the Covestro Future Cities competition (right), what kinds of things will you be looking for in their designs?

Im looking forward to seeing really creative ideas  Id love to be surprised and think:  I never thought of that! Carefully drawn, beautiful posters will always stand out, too, especially if theyre a bit different in their style  be brave and adventurous in the way you approach it!

"When you think about it, love really is all around us! From the earth under our feet and roofs over our heads, to the food we eat and sun that keeps us warm  our planet has treated humankind with love and care since the dawn of time!

Sadly, we humans have been taking this love for granted, and our wonderful planet is suffering. Species are at risk of extinction, pollution levels are climbing, ice is melting, and our wonderful wild spaces are disappearing. The world is in desperate need of our care

Isnt it time we showed the planet a little love in return?

This Valentines, Nat Geo Kids cant think of anyone more deserving of our love than our very own Planet Earth  and we hope youll join us in showering it with love!

That might sound like a huge task, but it doesnt have to be! In fact, we reckon you can show the planet your appreciation by simply giving a little bit of love, every day.

Weve put together a bumper list of the top 10 ways your family can love the planet back this year, so read on to learn how to appreciate nature from your home

1. Get to know your world!

The best way to show the world some love, is to learn about it. Why not try spending more time out in nature with your family? Visit some local green spaces, or even have a go at birdwatching from your window! All that matters is that you take the time to appreciate the nature you see. There are loads of apps that can help you do this: try AllTrails to find walks near you, or iNaturalist to help you identify wildlife! When you venture into the great outdoors, open your childs eyes to the world of wonder around them. Talk about the oxygen that green leaves are producing, the wood that provides materials for homes and furniture, the buzzing, pollinating insects that support the crops that produce our food. Even the soil below your feet is more than just dirt  its a huge natural recycling system, providing the nutrients that help nature flourish.

2. Tackle the little things!

When it comes to saving the planet, its easy to feel bombarded by the size and scale of the crisis, and the pressure to find solutions. But this can distract from the fact that you can make a big difference by taking action at home! Actions that help the planet dont have to take up much time or energy; there are lots of simple tasks that your kids can get involved in, too.

Encourage them to take simple actions, such as shorter showers, checking all the lights are off before you leave a room, or making sure that appliances are switched off at the wall when not in use. Small actions, taken by the many, can be a real gift to Planet Earth.

3. Show your kids that the world is wide!

While its really important to get to know your local area, kids also need an appreciation of the grand scale on which the planet works. Getting to know countries, people, animals, and habitats all over the world is an awe-inspiring experience, that can really open kids eyes to how amazing the planet is. In the long run, this will help them learn how to appreciate nature for themselves!

Here at Nat Geo Kids, we strive to inspire life-long curiosity about the world in our readers. Our monthly magazines are full of incredible information and activities all about our planet, and our website is also stuffed with free factsheets, fun and games! Check out our primary resources for ways to teach your kids about life in the rainforest, wild weather, or even cute animal couples (a Valentines day special!).  Start simple  plant trees.

This Valentines, Nat Geo Kids have teamed up with Ecologi, to bring you a fantastic way to show the world your love! For every magazine subscription bought between now and 16th February, we will plant five trees to help give back to our wonderful planet. Click here for more information!

For every five subscriptions bought, we will also donate one subscription to a disadvantaged child. Thats a whole lot of love!

4. Reduce your waste  and recycle what you can!

For many people, recycling is a part of life  and thats brilliant, keep it up! But whats even better, is working on reducing the amount of waste that you create. The next time you take your kids to a supermarket, why not make it a mission to collect as little packaging as possible? Say no to plastic produce bags, work out ways to snack on things that dont come in wrappers, and take your own shopping bags!

Did you know? Households in the UK waste 6.6 million tonnes of food every year! All that rotting waste gives off greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change.

Encourage your family to think carefully about food choices, too  make sure you only buy the ingredients you need, so the minimum amount is wasted. You could even go one step further and try a zero-waste shop for your weekly groceries. Why not have a look for your nearest one?

5. Get to grips with your garden (or even a sunny window ledge!)

You dont have to been green-fingered to grow your own! Getting in touch with some plants is an amazing way for kids to learn about the process of growth, and at the end of it youll have beautiful flowers, or tasty herbs, for all the family to enjoy!

If youre short on space, why not plant small? You only need a sunny window ledge to create your own herb garden, and you could even decorate the pots with recycled materials! For those with more space, great wildlife-friendly options include digging a pond, or even planting a tiny wildflower meadow. You and your kids could try planting some of your own vegetables, or making some wildlife-friendly crafts like this bug hotel! 6. Be a good role model  the planet will thank you for it!

You can teach your kids a lot about how to appreciate nature, by simply setting a good example. When youre out and about, try to be environmentally aware, and make sure you leave as small a mark as possible wherever you go! This means picking up your litter, and taking care of the countryside by respecting any local rules. The planet loves us in so many ways  the least we can do is show it a bit of respect in return!

When you walk through your local area, inspire your family to take care of the planet by picking up any litter you can safely collect, even if it isnt yours. You could even lead a neighbourhood litter pick, or take your children on an adventure to clean up a particular local area.

7. Do more with less, and teach your kids to do the same.

Waste not, want not! Try to teach your kids about the value of reusable toys, or toys that they make themselves. Chances are that theyll love these toys more, and encouraging them to use recycled materials, or repurpose old toys, will likely be cheaper in the long run, too! You can find simple instructions for toys to make at home on our website  just click here.

Did you know? A poll by the British Heart Foundation found that more than a quarter of parents admit to throwing away toys that are in perfect working order.

If your children lose interest in a toy, dont throw it away! Donate it to a charity shop, or ask around your friends to see if anyone is interested. You could even sell it, using an online marketing platform. This might take a little more time and effort than clicking order, but the planet will thank you for your efforts!

8. Take action in your local environment!

Volunteering for projects like tree planting, community gardening, and other conservation efforts is an incredibly worthwhile thing to spend your time on  and usually, very fun! Its a great way to get your family together outdoors, and to feel connected to the planet.

You cant get a much better gift than literally giving back to the world, so why not look for some opportunities near you? There are loads of different places to try, so youre sure to find one that really fits your familys interests. To start with, we recommend having a look at The Wildlife Trusts, The Conservation Volunteers, and Nature Volunteers UK!9. Be a sustainable consumer  in whatever way you can.

One of the very best ways to show the planet some love, is to balance out all the things we take from it, by remembering to give something back. Fortunately, there are lots of easy ways to do this. You can check them all out in our sustainable living primary resource!

Why not establish a veggie day in your household, where meat is banned? Your kids could get involved with picking the meal, and you might even find a new family favourite. Maybe itll be this veggie pasta bake, that your kids can help you make!

When you go to get the ingredients, try to avoid using the car if you can. Use public transport, and encourage your kids to get out and about by bicycle. If you do need to use the car, make the trip into a game, where the challenge is to get as many errands done in one journey as possible!

10. Dont stop!

Loving the planet needs to be a choice for life  not just for Valentines Day. Show your kids how to appreciate nature, by returning its love every day. Over time, your efforts will have a big impact on our planet, and were sure it couldnt be more grateful!

You can also inspire your kids to keep on learning by themselves, with our magazine! Every month, our issues are brimming with exciting articles, fantastic facts, and loads of activities to develop your kids love for the natural world. We want to help kids be planet-conscious, and inspire a love for the natural world that lasts long into adulthood.",0
"Plastic waste is a HUGE problem. Roughly 8 million tons of the stuff makes its way into our oceans every year  the equivalent of a whole truckload every minute. Now thats a lot of plastic pollution!

Waste plastic can have really harmful effects on the environment. Sadly, animals like sea turtles and seabirds can mistake it for food and accidentally eat it, and they often get tangled up in things like old ropes and nets. Plus, this waste plastic doesnt decompose; it just breaks down into smaller pieces  leaving tiny, toxic particles for sea creatures to eat.

But the good news is YOU can help do something about itThe Dopper Changemaker Challenge Junior invites children (aged 8-12) from all over the world to get involved and come up with their best ideas to help save our precious oceans, and find solutions to the single-use plastic problem.

To help you with your planet-protecting plans, Dopper provide handy free activity sheets and videos to get you started on your plastic-reducing mission! Its your task to come up with, sketch and build a solution that will influence peoples behaviour when it comes to single-use plastics.The Final 

The best 15 ideas of the bunch will be shortlisted and invited to travel down to London for a swanky special event. There, youll take part in the final and design your prototype in front of an influential panel of judges, including childrens TV presenter Lindsey Russell who will choose the winning design and crown the team the Dopper Junior Changemakers of 2020. Woop!

Whats more, the winning prototype will be developed and showcased in a public space for all to see and admire. How cool is that?WHO ARE DOPPER?

Dopper are on a mission to change the world by helping reduce single-use plastic waste and so protect the worlds water sources. Did you know 1 million single-use plastic bottles are bought every minute?

Doppers super-cool and customisable reusable water bottles are eliminating the need for single-use plastic bottles. Wow!",0
"Currently, humans produce WAY too much waste. We make products, consume them and then chuck them away, littering our planet in the process. But what if there was a different way to do things?

LINEAR ECONOMY n the natural world, there isnt any rubbish or landfill. Energy is provided by the Sun, one species waste is anothers food and when things die, their nutrients return to the soil  in a circle of life. Unfortunately, humans do things in a more linear wayWhen we want the latest phone or computer, we tend to bin the old one. When our dishwasher breaks, we buy a brand-new one. But this wasteful approach, known as the linear economy isnt working! Were running out of resources to make new things with, and were producing too much toxic waste.Thats why we need to move to a circular economy, inspired by the natural world  where everything has value and nothing is wasted  like the diagram below illustrates. CIRCULAR ECONOMY EXAMPLE!

In a circular economy, smart phones would be designed so they could be repaired more easily. And when they stopped working they would be simple to take apart so that the precious metals and materials inside them could be reused in another product, or returned safely to nature.",0
"If youve been watching the news lately, chances are youll have heard lots about an illness thats affecting people around the world, called coronavirus.

Its natural to feel worried about stuff you read in the news. If youre feeling anxious about coronavirus, talk to a trusted grown-up, like a parent, guardian or teacher about how youre feeling. You can also find online support on the Open Minds website.

In this article well answer your questions like, what is coronavirus, how is it spread and what can I do

 

What is coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that affect animals. Occasionally, coronaviruses have been known to move from animals to humans. The coronavirus were talking about today is a new virus, which causes an illness called COVID-19.

 

How did the coronavirus outbreak start?

Its not completely clear how the outbreak started, but its thought its likely to have begun in Wuhan, China at a local meat market known to sell wild animal meat.

We still dont know for sure which animal sparked the outbreak, but its thought that the new virus could have originated in bats. Bats werent sold at the market, but they may have come into contact with the animals that were.

 

How is coronavirus spread?  Because we havent encountered this virus before, scientists have had to work hard to discover exactly how it spreads. Similar viruses, like colds and flu, spread through water droplets in coughs and sneezes. These droplets can live on surfaces and spread when someone touches them with their hands. People become infected when they then touch their hands to their mouth, nose or eyes.

Coronavirus is mostly spread through the air, when people are in close contact with each other. This is why its very important that we socially distance from other people, and wear a mask. Wearing a mask over your mouth and nose helps to stop your water droplets from reaching other people. If we all wear masks, we all keep our droplets to ourselves!

Being in places with lots of fresh air also helps stop these droplets from reaching other people, which is why we dont have to wear our masks outside. Some places you go to, like your school, might open windows and doors to help with this, too.

 

What are the symptoms of coronavirus?

For the most people, including kids, this coronavirus isnt dangerous. It will make them feel poorly for a short time, before they make a full recovery. For a few people, like the elderly and people who have long-term health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or asthma, the risk of becoming very ill is more serious. Thats why these people are making extra efforts to have less face-to-face contact with others at the moment.

That means you might have to change the way you keep in touch with grandparents, friends or family who are vulnerable, for the time-being. For example, how about video calling your grandparents, or sending them a letter? Its good to keep in touch, but in a way that keeps you and others safe.

Coronavirus symptoms include:

 a high temperature

 a new, continuous cough

 a loss or change to your sense of smell and taste

If you feel poorly, tell a trusted adult like a parent, guardian or teacher.

 

What can I do?  There are plenty of small, easy things you can do. You probably do some of them already, but at this time, we all just need to be extra sensible and cautious as we go about our daily lives and activities:

 Wash your hands more regularly, for at least 20 seconds  thats about as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice! Dry them with a paper towel and then chuck it in the bin!

 If you cant wash your hands with soap and water, then use hand-sanitiser.

 Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose and mouth.

 Wear your mask properly, everywhere that you need to. Make sure it covers your mouth and nose, and dont forget to put it in the wash regularly, too!

 Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Bin the tissue and wash your hands afterwards.

 Try to avoid hand-to-hand contact with others outside of your immediate family, and stay a safe distance from them. There are all sorts of ingenious ways that people around the world are learning to make contact with each other without touching hands, like footshakes instead of handshakes!

 Avoid contact with people who feel unwell, or if you feel poorly, let a trusted adult know.

 

What are people doing about coronavirus?

Thankfully, there are lots of people like scientists, government officials and medical professionals working extremely hard to learn how to better prevent, control and treat this virus.

Scientists have created a vaccine for COVID-19, in record time! Vaccines give people protection from the virus. In the UK, theyre being given to the most vulnerable people, like grandparents and hospital staff, first, because they are at the highest risk of catching coronavirus. Some people have already received the vaccine, which is brilliant news!

In the meantime, there are lots of changes being made to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Some of them might feel a bit scary or unusual, but rest assured, theyre being made to keep you and others safe:

 People who feel unwell, and the people they live with, are being asked to self-isolate. This basically means staying at home for 14 days so that you dont pass the virus on to others. People cant come to visit you during this time, but you can go outside if you have a private garden or balcony.

 Everyone is now social distancing from most other people. This basically means keeping your distance from others, avoiding social gatherings like meeting with friends, going to sporting events or gigs. This is to help prevent the virus from passing from person to person.

 Your parents may be asked to work from home. This might mean your family routine changes while they spend more time than usual at home.

 Your school may be closed, meaning that you will be staying at home during the week. Your teacher may set you school work for you to do at home, or even teach classes online.

 Cafs, restaurants, events and other public places may be closed.

These changes wont be around forever, but they are important steps towards slowing the spread of coronavirus.

 

Should I be worried?

You might feel worried about coronavirus, about how it might affect you, your family and friends, and the changes that we are making to our daily lives at this time. The important thing to remember is that we are all in this together. Talk to your friends and family about your worries and work out how you will support each other during the coming weeks, ensuring you all stay happy and healthy.   Things you can do:

 Do things that make you happy like drawing, reading, and playing games.

 Have a break from talking or thinking about coronavirus. Keep yourself busy and dont overcheck the news.

 Dont believe everything that your friends tell you about coronavirus. Check the facts with a parent or trusted adult.

 Your parents, family and friends might be under more stress than usual, especially if they are working from home, or having to self-isolate, so think about things you can do to cheer them up. Perhaps you could help by tidying the house or writing them a note to brighten up their day?",0
"Periods of fasting occur for a multitude of reasons in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Feed withdrawal is widely used prior to transport, parasite treatments, preslaughter and for depuration purposes in recirculating aquaculture systems. Voluntary fasting is a coping response when fish have poor health or are exposed to poor farm environments. Owing to increased attention to animal welfare in aquaculture, concerns have been raised regarding ethical issues when farmed fish are subjected to fasting. However, thorough science-based recommendations for fasting and feed-withdrawal regimes have been lacking. The purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of the various causes for fasting in Atlantic salmon aquaculture and evaluate their associated welfare implications so that guidelines for appropriate practices can be formulated. To interpret impacts, we describe biological responses and tolerance limits to fasting in Atlantic salmon and consider adaptations in the wild. Fry and parr are highly sensitive to feed withdrawal. However, post-smolts and adults are well-adapted to endure prolonged fasting without experiencing compromised functionality or health. Here, short periods of feed withdrawal prior to operations should therefore not constitute significant welfare concerns. Serious concerns are instead associated with voluntary fasting that may continue for weeks. We emphasize that environmental extremes that exceed appetite impairing thresholds must be avoided. Additionally, farmed fish should not be subjected to practices that lead to chronic stress that induce cessation of appetite. Diseases or parasites that impair appetite should also be mitigated. Fasting is here a symptom rather than a cause for poor welfare.",1
"Genomic data are becoming increasingly affordable and easy to collect, and new tools for their analysis are appearing rapidly. Conservation biologists are interested in using this information to assist in management and planning but are typically limited financially and by the lack of genomic resources available for non-model taxa. It is therefore important to be aware of the pitfalls as well as the benefits of applying genomic approaches. Here, we highlight recent methods aimed at standardizing population assessments of genetic variation, inbreeding, and forms of genetic load and methods that help identify past and ongoing patterns of genetic interchange between populations, including those subjected to recent disturbance. We emphasize challenges in applying some of these methods and the need for adequate bioinformatic support. We also consider the promises and challenges of applying genomic approaches to understand adaptive changes in natural populations to predict their future adaptive capacity.",1
"The net outcomes of mutualisms are mediated by the trade-offs between the costs and benefits provided by both partners. Our review proposes the existence of a trade-off in ant protection mutualisms between the benefits generated by the ants protection against the attack of herbivores and the losses caused by the disruption of pollination processes, which are commonly not quantified. This trade-off has important implications for understanding the evolution of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), an adaptation that has repeatedly evolved throughout the flowering plant clade. We propose that the outcome of this trade-off is contingent on the specific traits of the organisms involved. We provide evidence that the protective mutualisms between ants and plants mediated by EFNs have optimal protective ant partners, represented by the optimum point of the balance between positive effects on plant protection and negative effects on pollination process. Our review also provides important details about a potential synergism of EFN functionality; that is, these structures can attract ants to protect against herbivores and/or distract them from flowers so as not to disrupt pollination processes. Finally, we argue that generalizations regarding how ants impact plants should be made with caution since ants effects on plants vary with the identity of the ant species in their overall net outcome.",1
"Biological invasions pose significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Removal of introduced species is most successful when detected early. We evaluate the effectiveness of passive acoustics combined with automated recognition in detecting the invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus). We applied this technique to two real-world monitoring programs aimed at determining the optimal time of day for monitoring the species in Europe, for which we recorded the species in Belgium and Italy; and for evaluating the effectiveness of BirdNET (a free and user-friendly automated recognizer) in analyzing a large dataset collected in Spain. BirdNET was highly effective in automatically detecting the bullfrog presence, with a detection rate (compared to visual inspection of sonograms) of 89.5% using default settings (85 of 95 recordings with known presence), and 95.8% with user-specific settings (91 of 95 recordings detected). The system showed remarkable precision, correctly identifying 99.7% (612 out of 614) of the verified predictions, and with only one mislabelled recording (predicted to be present when it was absent). The species vocal activity in Belgium and Italy was higher during the night compared to crepuscular periods. Recording analyses and output verification of the dataset collected in Spain was carried out in 3.8% of the recorded time, and resulted in significantly reduced effort compared to visual inspection. Our study highlights the effectiveness of this technique for remotely surveying the American bullfrog, making it a significantly potential tool for informing management decisions, particularly for the early detection of the species arrival in new areas.",1
"With genetic information gained from next-generation sequencing (NGS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it is now possible to select for genes that encode reporter molecules that may be used to detect abnormalities such as alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), cancer, cognitive impairment, multiple sclerosis (MS), diabesity, and ischemic stroke (IS). This, however, requires a thorough understanding of the gutbrain axis (GBA), the effect diets have on the selection of gut microbiota, conditions that influence the expression of microbial genes, and human physiology. Bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a major role in gut homeostasis, maintain intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and regulate the immune system, neurological, and endocrine functions. Changes in butyrate levels may serve as an early warning of colon cancer. Other cancer-reporting molecules are colibactin, a genotoxin produced by polyketide synthetase-positive Escherichia coli strains, and spermine oxidase (SMO). Increased butyrate levels are also associated with inflammation and impaired cognition. Dysbiosis may lead to increased production of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (OX-LDLs), known to restrict blood vessels and cause hypertension. Sudden changes in SCFA levels may also serve as a warning of IS. Early signs of ARLD may be detected by an increase in regenerating islet-derived 3 gamma (REG3G), which is associated with changes in the secretion of mucin-2 (Muc2). Pro-inflammatory molecules such as cytokines, interferons, and TNF may serve as early reporters of MS. Other examples of microbial enzymes and metabolites that may be used as reporters in the early detection of life-threatening diseases are reviewed.",1
"The last decades have witnessed amazing advances in engineering individual microbes for practical applications. However, engineering microbial consortia is a recent development, opening a new path for diverse applications, including curing gut diseases, solving food shortages, enabling sustainable bioproduction, mitigating pollution, and potentially addressing the climate crisis. In this perspective article, I will summarize recent technological innovations in synthetic biology that enable probiotic and microbiome engineering. Additionally, I will cover associated issues such as biosafety and biocontainment when the probiotics and microbiota are engineered. Given the complexity of global problems that are difficult to solve using a single microbe, this perspective will guide the research community to a better future with exciting potential applications.",1
