"Deepfakes are videos with visual or audio content that has been manipulated. They make it seem as if the videos subject is saying words he or she hasnt actually spoken. In the past, videos like these could be made only by trained special-effects artists or video editors. Now, anyone with the time and the right tools can make a convincing deepfake.

These videos are dangerous. Many people are worried that deepfake technology will be used to trick the public. Imagine if someone made a deepfake of a world leader or other powerful person, then uploaded it to the Internet. How would people know they could believe what they were seeing and hearing?

Wael Abd-Almageed is trying to answer that question. He leads a team of five other researchers at the University of Southern California. To do his work, Abd-Almageed received a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The agency is part of the United States Department of Defense.

Abd-Almageed and his team designed computer software that can determine whether a video is a deepfake. It uses artificial intelligence to search the video for clues that the subjects face has been manipulated.

According to Abd-Almageed, deepfakes often contain mistakes that his teams technology can detect. If there is inconsistency in the video, such as how the eyes and mouth move, we can spot it, he told TIME for Kids.

Dont Be Fooled
How can you avoid being fooled by a deepfake? Abd-Almageed advises not immediately believing what you see online. Instead, make sure to research a video first. Dont take anything on the Internet for granted, he warns. Ask yourself, Would this person actually say something like this? Look into the videos source, too. Who made it? Who posted it?

Abd-Almageed also suggests watching a video at a slower speed so you can spot inconsistencies. This is possible using the settings on most popular video platforms, including YouTube. But he believes that, as deepfakes become more advanced, equally advanced technology must be created in response. Every day, someone will create a better deepfake, Abd-Almageed says. We have to try to detect it.",0
"On September 27, 2023, Frank Rubio broke the record for the longest U.S. spaceflight. When he returned to Earth, his first meal was a salad. What most of us crave when we get back is fresh food, he told TIME. Thats the meal he wanted most while at the International Space Station (see International Platform).

Rubios record-breaking 371-day mission was unexpected. It was supposed to be 180 days, but a coolant leak on the craft that was supposed to bring him home delayed his return by six months.

Nearly four months after coming back to Earth, Rubio answered questions about his out-of-this-world experience.What does a typical day look like in space?
We conduct tons of experiments. I think there were more than 300 experiments that our crew was a part of while I was up there. Also, [we] have to put in a lot of time and effort toward maintaining our own bodies. Personally, I enjoy exercise, so time spent exercising also helps with my psychological health. And then you spend a fair amount of time performing maintenance [on the station]. Every once in a while, you get to do some really cool things, like a spacewalk. Every day is incredibly busy.What has readjusting to life on Earth been like?
You adapt quickly to being in space, but the readaptation process back to Earth can be longer and more difficult. Gravity and the forces at play here have a stronger effect on your body. It takes two to three months to get yourself back to where you were preflight. Im feeling pretty normal. At this point, I feel like Im back to 90 to 95%.Was it hard to be away from family for a long time?
By far, the biggest challenge is being away from family, but youre able to call [Earth] anytime you want. And at least once or twice a week, you can do a video conference. While youre up there, you tend to miss your loved ones quite a bit. Those video conferences really helped.What was your most memorable moment?
Thats a tough one. Launch was fantastic, it was everything I thought it was going to be. And then you get to space, and you see the Earth for the first time. And then you go out and do a spacewalk. The engineering that has gone into keeping you alive in a small space suit is incredible. Just the fact that youre able to live in space for a full year is mind-blowing. And then, at the end of it, you become a meteorite [as you] reenter the Earths atmosphere. The fact that people were able to get that exactly right is pretty special. So Id say the whole year was full of incredible, once-in-a-lifetime experiences.Are you interested in going back?
I absolutely want to go back. I dont know if I would want to break the record again, but I hope to be a part of human spaceflight for a bit longer. I really do believe in the mission. I think what we do for the benefit of humanity is incredible. If Im able to go back, great; if Im not, hopefully I can be a part of the team and help [get] somebody else back to the moon, and then onward from there.The International Space Station, or ISS, is a football-field-size platform that orbits Earth from nearly 250 miles away. It has been in orbit for 25 years, and more than 270 astronauts from different countries have visited. While aboard the ISS, crew members conduct and check the progress of science and technology experiments. These experiments might one day help us travel farther into space, for longer periods of time.",0
"More than a trillion cicadas are coming to the United States. Two broods of the red-eyed flying insects are emerging from the ground this month. People in the Midwest and Southeast should expect a season of high-pitched buzzing.Brood XIX cicadas show up every 13 years. Brood XIII cicadas show up every 17 years. The last time these two broods arrived together was more than two hundred years ago, in 1803. Heres what to know about this rare event.What Are Cicadas?
Cicadas are in the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs. For more than a decade, they live in burrows seven to eight inches underground, and then, when theyre mature enough, they make their way out.Periodical cicadas are about an inch long. Their wingspan is about twice that length. Theyre identified by their orange wing veins and big red eyes. There are seven different species, three of which surface every 17 years. The other four emerge every 13 years.

Most cicadas show up right on time. But sometimes they count the years wrong. For instance, people were surprised when thousands of cicadas emerged in the year 2000, four years ahead of schedule.

What to Expect
Cicadas will be seen across several states. Probably only twoIllinois and Indianawill get to see both broods. Brood XIII might appear in Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Brood XIX might be seen in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North and South Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia.The male cicadas mating call is a loud buzz. Many people find it annoying. But cicadas are harmless to humans (see Insect Impact). They dont sting or bite.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says cicadas can have a positive impact on nearby plants and animals. Theyre a great food source for birds, such as hawks (left). And theyre nutritious for the soil as they decompose. Cicadas wont be harmful to flowers or fruit, because they only consume sap from trees and shrubs.

Female cicadas can damage a young tree if they lay their eggs in its branches. To protect trees, the EPA suggests covering them in mesh or netting. Cicada Safari is a website created by Mount St. Joseph University, in Ohio. It suggests wrapping a trees branches with cheesecloth to keep cicadas away.",0
"Frogs are animal athletes, with strong powerful legs that allow them to leap out of harms way. These powerful limbs are the secret to their success  and incredibly, it takes baby frogs weeks and weeks to grow them!

Like beautiful butterflies, frogs and toads undergo an astonishing transformation  which is called metamorphosis  as they grow up. From jelly-like eggs laid in water, they grow into wriggling tadpoles, and finally grow legs suitable for land!

But how does this mesmerising metamorphosis work? Lets have a look at each stage of the frog life cycle in turn, to find out

It all starts with adult frogs laying hundreds of tiny eggs, which clump together in groups known as frogspawn. This happens in early spring, when the weather is just starting to get warmer. Spotting frogspawn is often thought of as being a key sign of spring!

You can hunt for frogspawn in shallow, still water  a garden pond, for example! As the eggs are defenceless, theyre usually laid among vegetation and just below the surface of the water, to give them some protection.If youre lucky enough to spot some of these strange eggs, pay attention to their shape. Frogs lay frogspawn, which looks like a round cluster of eggs, while toads lay toadspawn, which comes in long ribbons.

DID YOU KNOW?
As far as scientists are concerned, theres no difference between frogs and toads! They have different characteristics, but share the same family tree.

In the frogspawn, the baby frogs start out as tiny black dots surrounded by a jelly-like substance. Over time, they become comma-shaped, as their tails begin to develop  amazing! After spending 1-3 weeks eating the yolk of their egg, the baby frog hatches into the big, wide world.

Now, the baby frogs are known as tadpoles. They have gills, a mouth, and a long tail, which they need for swimming!

DID YOU KNOW?
The tadpole stage of the frog life cycle is also known as the larval stage. Tadpoles are frog larvae, in the same way that caterpillars are butterfly larvae!

For the first week or two after hatching, tadpoles wont move around very much, as theyre still absorbing some nutrition from the yolk of their egg. However, once the yolk is all gone, the tadpoles are big and strong enough to venture out into their watery world!

Unlike adult frogs, tadpoles cant go on land  so they feed on plant material filtered from the water, and tear off tiny chunks of nearby vegetation.The legless, water-bound tadpoles slowly metamorphose into frogs over the next 14 weeks.

First, they grow back legs, then front legs too! Soon after, their body starts to change shape, and theyre able to start eating insects.Next, the tadpoles tails shrink away, and skin grows over their gills, as they develop lungs and eardrums! These are super important steps, as they prepare the tadpole for life on land.

Once their gills and tails are gone forever, tadpoles undergo one last 24-hour push, where the metamorphosis completes. Once this stage is finished, the baby frogs emerge from the water as tiny adults!

Amazingly, tadpoles are able to control the timing of their transformation. If theyre living in a dangerous environment, like a pond full of hungry fish, they will metamorphose more quickly, to make their escape! On the other hand, if their pond has lots of plants to munch through, and few predators  or if its extra cold on land  tadpoles can delay their metamorphosis, and remain in the water for up to a year. Wow!

And there you have it  the frogs are all grown up, and ready to head out into the big wide world!

As adults, frogs and toads are much less reliant on water. So long as they stick to the shade and dont dry out, they can live on land  but they often return to ponds and lakes for a splash!

Before too long, the females will look for water to lay her own eggs. Once thats happened, the life cycle is complete  what a frog-tastic life they lead!",0

"The capacity of doxorubicin to inhibit topoisomerase II in the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line is supported by the induction of protein-associated single-strand breaks in DNA, as well as by interference with the decatenation activity of nuclear extracts. Doxorubicin also produces non-protein-associated DNA strand breaks (at a supraclinical concentration of 5 microM), which may indicate damage mediated via the generation of free radicals. However, no strand breaks are detected in DNA of MCF-7 cells at the IC50 for doxorubicin (approximately 0.1 microM). At doxorubicin concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 microM, at which growth is inhibited by approximately 15, 50, and 75%, respectively, doxorubicin interferes with radiation-induced unwinding of DNA; doxorubicin also produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis that corresponds closely to growth inhibition. These studies suggest that DNA strand breaks fail to fully account for the antiproliferative activity of doxorubicin in the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line. Compromised DNA synthesis associated with interference with DNA unwinding may contribute to growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells exposed to doxorubicin.",1
"A new flow cytometric method is described to detect DNA strand breaks associated with apoptosis, by labeling the 3'-OH termini in the breaks with biotinylated dUTP in a reaction employing exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The method has been applied in studies on leukemic HL-60 and MOLT-4 cell lines to reveal whether it is specific to apoptotic cells, and whether it can be used in the clinic to detect DNA breakage in leukemic cells during chemotherapy. There was labeling of mononuclear cells in peripheral blood of all 11 patients studied during chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous, or chronic myelogenous leukemia (ALL, AML, or CML) in blastic crisis, indicating induced DNA damage; the number of labeled cells increased from 1-8% before treatment up to 80% during the course of treatment. The DNA topoisomerase inhibitors mitoxantrone, VP-16 (etoposide), and m-AMSA (amsacrine) were more effective in inducing DNA breaks than was hydroxyurea or cytosine arabinoside (AraC). Cells with DNA breaks were identified in peripheral blood for up to 5 days following administration of Mitoxantrone and VP-16. In the case of DNA aneuploid leukemias, the DNA breaks were predominant in the aneuploid cell subpopulations, whereas presumably non-neoplastic diploid cells were unlabeled. In one case of ALL there were two distinct subpopulations of aneuploid cells: one responded to the treatment (by DNA breakage) and the other was non-responding. Thus, cells undergoing apoptosis can be detected by this method of labeling DNA strand breaks and the technique is applicable for analysis of response of leukemic cells to chemotherapy. With this method it may be possible to identify tumor cell sensitivity or resistance to particular drugs early in the course of treatment.",1
"Recent evidence suggests that a variety of organisms may harness some of the unique features of quantum mechanics to gain a biological advantage. These features go beyond trivial quantum effects and may include harnessing quantum coherence on physiologically important timescales. In this brief review we summarize the latest results for non-trivial quantum effects in photosynthetic light harvesting, avian magnetoreception and several other candidates for functional quantum biology. We present both the evidence for and arguments against there being a functional role for quantum coherence in these systems.",1
"Instead of having to rely on gedanken (thought) experiments, it is possible to base this discussion of the foundations of quantum physics on actually performed experiments because of the enormous experimental progress in recent years.

Not only have such fundamental experiments realized many historic proposals, they also helped to sharpen our quantum intuition. This recently led to the development of a new field, quantum information, where quantum teleportation and quantum computation are some of the most fascinating topics.

The effects of isolating entire modular systems or of disconnecting the component parts can be observed. The features of a left hemisphere specialized capacity to interpret the actions of modules are discussed in terms of human consciousness.,1
