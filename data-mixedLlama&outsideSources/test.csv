It's made up of four chemical bases - adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) - that are arranged in a specific sequence to form a code. This code is used to create proteins, which perform a wide range of functions in the body.Understanding Human DNA-----------------------Human DNA is made up of 23 pairs of chromosomes, with each pair containing a long, complex molecule called a chromatin. Each chromatin contains around 20,000-25,000 genes, which are the basic units of heredity. These genes code for proteins that perform specific functions in the body, such as building and maintaining tissues, producing hormones, and fighting off diseases.The Structure of Human DNA-------------------------Human DNA is structured into two main parts: the exons and the introns. Exons are the coding regions of the DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins. Introns, on the other hand, are non-coding regions that do not code for proteins but instead regulate the expression of genes.The Genetic Code----------------The genetic code is the set of rules that dictates how the sequence of nucleotides in DNA is translated into the sequence of amino acids in proteins. This code is written in triplets, with each triplet specifying one of the 20 amino acids that can be incorporated into proteins.DNA Replication and Repair-------------------------Human DNA replicates itself during cell division to ensure that each new cell has a complete set of chromosomes. This process is crucial for the growth, development, and maintenance of tissues in the body. DNA also has mechanisms to repair any damage that may occur during normal cellular functions or exposure to environmental factors such as radiation and chemicals.DNA Testing and Personalized Medicine-----------------------------------Advances in DNA technology have made",0

The answer lies in your DNA. Short for deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is like a blueprint for your body, containing the instructions for how to grow and maintain your cells, tissues, and organs. In this text, we'll explore the basics of human DNA and why it's so important for our health and well-being.What is DNA?----------------DNA is a long, complex molecule that's made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). These bases are arranged in pairs, with A always pairing with T, and G always pairing with C. This base pairing creates a code that determines the characteristics of an individual, such as eye color, hair texture, and height.The Structure of DNA-----------------------DNA is made up of two strands of molecules that are twisted together in a double helix structure. Each strand has a backbone made of sugar molecules, with phosphate groups attached to the sugar molecules. The sugar molecules and phosphate groups provide a framework for the base pairs to attach to.How is DNA Replicated?-----------------------DNA replication is the process by which cells make copies of their DNA before dividing into two daughter cells. This process involves unwinding the double helix structure, making a copy of the DNA sequence, and then rewinding the double helix to form two identical copies of the original DNA molecule.How Do We Inherit Traits?-------------------------We inherit traits from our parents through their DNA. Each parent contributes half of the DNA needed for a child's development, with the mother contributing an X chromosome and the father contributing either an X or a Y chromosome. This is why children often resemble their parents, as they inherit many of their genetic traits.DNA Testing------------DNA testing has become increasingly popular in recent years,",0

It's made up of four nucleotide bases - adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) - arranged in a specific sequence. This sequence determines the function of each gene, which is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or performs a specific function.The Double Helix-----------------DNA has a unique double helix structure, where two strands of nucleotides are twisted together like a ladder. This structure allows for easy replication and transcription of the genetic information encoded in the DNA. The double helix was first discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, and their discovery revolutionized our understanding of genetics and biology.The Genetic Code-----------------The genetic code is the set of rules that determines how the sequence of nucleotides in DNA is translated into proteins. Each gene in your DNA contains a specific sequence of nucleotides that codes for a specific amino acid, which is then assembled into a protein. The genetic code is universal, meaning it's the same for all living organisms, and it's what makes it possible to create proteins that perform specific functions in the body.DNA Replication----------------DNA replication is the process by which cells make copies of their DNA before dividing into two daughter cells.

" in genetics and molecular biology.Human DNA is a complex and dynamic system that contains the instructions for creating the unique characteristics of our species. The study of human DNA has led to a deeper understanding of the structure and function of our genomes, and has opened up new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. In this text, we will explore the key features of human DNA and how it is being studied by experts in the field of genetics and molecular biology.Firstly, it is important to understand that human DNA is made up of four nucleotide bases - adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). These bases are arranged in a specific sequence to form genes, which are the basic units of heredity. The human genome contains approximately 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes, as well as non-coding regions that regulate gene expression and other functions.One of the most significant advances in the study of human DNA has been the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. These technologies allow researchers to sequence entire genomes quickly and accurately, at a fraction of the cost and time required just a few years ago. This has led to a surge in the amount of data being generated, and has opened up new opportunities for researchers to study the human genome in unprecedented detail.One of the key areas of focus for experts in genetics and molecular biology is the study of genetic variation. This refers to the differences in DNA sequences between individuals and populations, and can provide important clues about the origins of disease and other traits. By comparing the DNA sequences of different individuals and populations, researchers can identify variations that are associated with specific diseases or conditions, such as cancer or diabetes.Another area of focus is the study of epigenetics - the changes in gene expression that occur without a change in the underlying DNA sequence. These changes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including environmental exposures and lifestyle choices, and can have a significant impact on the development and progression of disease.

"Pour yourself a glass of water and take a sip. Did you know that the water you’ve just swallowed is the same water that wooly mammoths, King Tutankhamun and the first humans drank? That’s because Earth has been recycling water for over 4 billion years!

The world’s water moves between lakes, rivers, oceans, the atmosphere and the land in an ongoing cycle called – you guessed it! – the water cycle. As it goes through this continuous system, it can be a liquid (water), a gas (vapour) or a solid (ice).

So, are all you budding young geographers ready to learn some splashing new facts? Then join NG KiDS as we take a look at the different stages of the wonderful water cycle…Evaporation

Energy from the sun heats up the surface of the Earth, causing the temperature of the water in our rivers, lakes and oceans to rise. When this happens, some of the water “evaporates” into the air, turning into a gas called “vapour“. Plants and trees also lose water to the atmosphere through their leaves. This process is known as “transpiration“.

Condensation

As water vapour rises up high into the sky, it cools and turns back into a liquid, forming clouds. This process is called “condensation“. Currents high up in the air move these clouds around the globe.The water cycle is also known as the “hydrologic cycle“.

Precipitation

When too much water has condensed, the water droplets in the clouds become too big and heavy for the air to hold them. And so they fall back down to Earth as rain, snow, hail or sleet, a process known as “precipitation“.

Collection

The fallen precipitation is then “collected” in bodies of water – such as rivers, lakes and oceans – from where it will eventually evaporate back into the air, beginning the cycle all over again. How it is collected, depends on where it lands…

Some will fall directly into lakes, rivers or the sea, from where it will evaporate and begin the cycle all over again.
If the water falls on vegetation, it may evaporate from leaves back into the air, or trickle down to the ground. Some of this water may then be taken up by the plant roots in the earth.
In cold climates, the precipitation may build up on land as snow, ice or glaciers. If temperatures rise, the ice will melt to liquid water and then soak into the ground, or flow into rivers or the ocean.
Water that reaches land directly may flow across the ground and collect in the oceans, rivers or lakes. This water is called “surface run-off“. Some of the precipitation will instead soak (or “infiltrate”) into the soil, from where it will slowly move through the ground until eventually reaching a river or the ocean.

And there you have it, gang – the ongoing water cycle!Water can change from a solid to a gas, without becoming a liquid first. Through this process of “sublimation” our planet”s ice can evaporate directly into the air without melting!",0
"10 facts about the Moon

1) The Moon is a dusty ball of rock, measuring 3,476km in diameter – that’s roughly a quarter of the size of Earth.
2) Its surface is home to mountains, huge craters and flat planes called ‘seas’ made of hardened lava.3) The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite – a celestial body that orbits a planet. Its orbit around our planet is shaped like a slightly squashed circle known as an ellipse.4) It takes 27.3 days for the Moon to travel all the way around the Earth and complete its orbit.
5) Although the Moon shines bright in the night sky, it doesn’t produce its own light. We see the Moon because it reflects light from the Sun.
6) Ever noticed how the Moon appears to change shape each night? That’s because as the Moon orbits the Earth, the Sun lights up different parts of its surface – so it’s just our view of the Moon that’s changing, not the Moon itself. Find out more in our fascinating phases of the Moon feature!7) As the Moon travels, it rotates on its own axis, just like our planet. It takes roughly the same amount of time for the Moon to make a full rotation as it does for it to complete its orbit. This means we only ever see around 60% of the Moon’s surface from Earth! The part that faces Earth is known as the ‘near side’ and the other, the ‘far side’.
8) The temperature on the Moon varies from super hot to super cold! When the Sun hits its surface, temperatures can reach a scorching 127°C. But when the Sun ‘goes down’, temperatures can plummet to around -153°C. Brr…9) Like Earth, the Moon has gravity (the force that pulls things towards the ground). But the Moon’s gravity is weaker, only one sixth of the Earth’s gravity, in fact. That means you’d weigh much less if  you were to stand on the Moon!
10) Scientists aren’t entirely sure how the Moon formed. A popular theory is that a Mars-sized rock, named Theia, crashed into Earth around 4.5 billion years ago. The debris from the collision clumped together to make what is now… Our Moon!

"Facts about Mars 1) Named after the Roman God of war, Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system.

2) Mars is also known as the ‘Red Planet’ because, well, it’s red! This signature colour comes from the large amount of a chemical called iron oxide (or ‘rust’ as you might know it) in its rocks and soil.3) Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury. With a diameter (distance through the middle) of 6,791 kilometres, it’s roughly half the size of Earth.

4) It can get pretty cold on Mars –– much colder than our own planet, since it’s further away from the sun. At the equator, temperatures can reach 20°C, but at its poles they can plummet to as low as -140°C. Brr!
5)  Mars is home to the highest mountain in our solar system –– a volcano called Olympus Mons. Standing a whopping 24 kilometres high, it’s about three times the height of Mount Everest!

Did you know…? There are bits of Mars here on Earth! In the past, asteroids hit the Red Planet, sending debris into space. Some of this debris landed on our planet as meteorites.

6) You could jump around three times higher on Mars than you can on Earth. Boing! This is because the planet’s gravity – the force that keeps us on the ground – is much weaker.7) Do you like to look at the moon at night? Well, check this out –– Mars has two moons! One is called Phobos and the other Deimos.

8) A day on Mars is 24 hours and 37 minutes –– only a little bit longer than a day on our own planet. A year on Mars, however, is almost twice as long, lasting 687 Earth days! This is because it takes a lot longer than Earth to complete its orbit around the Sun.

Did you know that we have a FREE downloadable Mars primary resource? Great for teachers, homeschoolers and parents alike!

9) Until recently, scientists believed that there was no liquid water on the surface of Mars –– only rocks, soil dust and ice. But… News flash! In 2018, they found evidence of a lake under the planet’s south polar ice cap. Exciting stuff!10) Humans have not yet been to Mars, but scientists have sent spacecraft there to help them research this fascinating planet. The first spacecraft to land on Mars were the Viking Landers, which touched down on the surface in 1976.

"Termites are global pest for man-made structures, and in some parts of the world, they infest agricultural crops as well. Termite control relies predominately on chemical insecticides, but the negative impacts of synthetic termiticides on the environment limit their applications. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are considered an environmentally friendly alternative. Nevertheless, termites have developed various defensive behavioral strategies to circumvent EPF. In this review, we summarize (1) the use of EPF as a biological control agent and strategies/defenses of termites that minimize the effectiveness of EPF, (2) the potential of integrating entomopathogenic fungi with RNA interference (RNAi) as an effective termite control strategy, (3) discussed nanoparticles (silver, chitosan, titanium, etc) which are biosynthesized from different EPF. Nanoparticles have the ability to deliver RNAi triggers (dsRNA/siRNA), so we proposed the synthesis of EPF-based nanoparticles and dsRNA/siRNA complex as potential strategy to control termite pests.",1
"Reef-building corals (Scleractinia, Anthozoa, Cnidaria) are the keystone organisms of coral reefs, which constitute the most diverse marine ecosystems. Since the first decoded coral genome reported in 2011, about 40 reference genomes are registered as of 2023. Comparative genomic analyses of coral genomes have revealed genomic characters that may underlie unique biological characteristics and coral diversification. These include existence of genes for biosynthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, loss of an enzyme necessary for cysteine biosynthesis in family Acroporidae, and lineage-specific gene expansions of DMSP lyase-like genes in the genus Acropora. While symbiosis with endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates is a common biological feature among reef-building corals, genes associated with the intricate symbiotic relationship encompass not only those shared by many coral species, but also genes that were uniquely duplicated in each coral lineage, suggesting diversified molecular mechanisms of coral-algal symbiosis. Coral genomic data have also enabled detection of hidden, complex population structures of corals, indicating the need for species-specific, local-scale, carefully considered conservation policies for effective maintenance of corals. Consequently, accumulating coral genomic data from a wide range of taxa and from individuals of a species not only promotes deeper understanding of coral reef biodiversity, but also promotes appropriate and effective coral reef conservation. Considering the diverse biological traits of different coral species and accurately understanding population structure and genetic diversity revealed by coral genomic analyses during coral reef restoration planning could enable us to “archive” coral reef environments that are nearly identical to natural coral reefs.",1
"The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends that short-acting ?2-agonist (SABA) monotherapy should no longer be prescribed, and that as-needed combination inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)–formoterol is the preferred reliever therapy in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. These recommendations are based on the risks of SABA monotherapy, the evidence that ICS-formoterol reliever therapy markedly decreases the occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations compared with SABA reliever therapy alone, and because ICS-formoterol reliever therapy has a favorable risk/benefit profile compared with maintenance ICS plus SABA reliever therapy. Data supporting the use of combination ICS-albuterol reliever therapy in mild asthma are more limited, but there are studies that inform its use in this population. In this review, we compare, using a pros and cons format, the (1) long-term safety and efficacy of ICS-formoterol reliever therapy versus SABA reliever therapy alone, (2) long-term safety and efficacy of ICS-albuterol reliever therapy versus SABA reliever therapy alone, (3) immediate bronchodilator effects of ICS-formoterol versus SABA alone, and (4) clinical and regulatory factors that may inform reliever therapy prescription decisions. By presenting the evidence of these reliever inhaler options, we hope to inform the reader while also calling for necessary future effectiveness and implementation research.",1
